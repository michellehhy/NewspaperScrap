1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46638419,"My name is Tim and I'm a cheese addict. But what I've been discovering recently has shaken me to the core. I can barely look a Babybel in the face. A half-eaten halloumi squeaklessly lies yellowing in the fridge. My cheese dreams are shattering. For, after a lifetime of unfettered devotion, could it possibly be that cheese is more foe than friend? That I am addicted to something that is not so good for my body? That cheese should be toast? These are questions that began surfacing a couple of months ago when I began making an episode for my new podcast for the BBC, All Hail Kale, looking into whether dairy was scary.  For some time, I'd increasingly been questioning the logic of adults drinking milk.  While milk and dairy products, such as cheese and yoghurt, are good sources of protein and calcium and can form part of a healthy, balanced diet, as Dr Michael Greger, from NutritionFacts.org, put it to me: ""There's no animal on the planet that drinks milk after weaning - and then to drink milk of another species even doesn't make any sense.""  He then reeled off a series of studies showing the life-shortening potential of drinking this ""hormonal stew"". I'd always blithely assumed cheese was a more mature - perhaps benign or even more beneficial - form of dairy. It fitted a mental picture of spritely, long-living Greeks and Italians liberally sprinkling around feta and pecorino; yet in reality, only a low to moderate amount of cheese figures in the hallowed Mediterranean Diet.  I'd also unilaterally decided that a childhood diagnosis of lactose-intolerance should in no way impede me from mainlining paneer when in India or, when skiing, spending more time forking bread into fondue than bothering with the slopes. Perhaps this sense of denial-cum-delusion stems from an actual addiction. One US doctor controversially (and not supported by any of the professors I spoke to) refers to cheese as ""dairy crack"" - for apparently containing addictive, opiate-like chemicals - and even suggests a three-step programme to de-cheese. Step One: know why you want to break away. Well, I don't know that I do want to break away.  But in the journalistic pursuit of seeing whether cheese is a less scary form of dairy than milk, I took my head out of the sand (under which a special Turkish cheese is apparently fermented) and contacted three heavy-hitters in nutrition. They all agreed the milk secretion of another species is a strange thing for us to have latched onto - and adult humans have no need to drink it. But could a cheese consensus be reached? Dr Michael Greger took a hard line: cheese, with its combination of sodium and concentrated butterfat, should not be part of our daily diets. ""Make it for a special occasion rather than the day-to-day."" Dr Walter Willett, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health - took a more semi-hard view of cheese. ""It does not seem to have the same growth-promoting effects as milk does. Have your Brie in moderation and enjoy it."" He said we should have only one portion of dairy a day.  Over at Cornell University, its Nutrition professor David Levitsky took a distinctly softer stance on the perils of dairy - and confessed to having a small cheese plate before dinner every night. ""I enjoy it, but I don't eat masses of cheese."" The consensus, of sorts, was that cheese should certainly not be at the high end of the spectrum. In the spirit of de-ostriching, I then went to see Dr Enam Abood from the Harley Street Health Centre to get my lactose intolerance retested 30 years on. She confirmed that not only was the intolerance still in force but by ignoring it I might have inflamed my gut.  According to Dr Abood, my ropey gut means I'm probably not absorbing vitamins and minerals, which isn't great for my immune system, energy levels, and even maybe my mood.  The damage is most likely the result of me overdoing dairy for years.  Dr Abood recommended that if I consume cheese, I should pop a lactase pill - giving me the enzyme I, and many people like me, lack to be able to digest dairy properly. The one silver (gut) lining from my medical travels was an intestinal expert telling me that a nice piece of bacteria-rich, non-processed, unpasteurised cheese will go down a treat with the gut microbiome.  Having also been making an All Hail Kale episode on the role of the gut to your moods, this seemed like an excellent rationale to keep cheese on the table.  I never got as far as Step Two: think about what you can do to change the recipes you have already. Step Three - think about the non-dairy cheeses - seemed too much to even consider stomaching. Instead, I think about how bewildering it is to get definitive answers around nutrition. I think I should remember to carry around lactase enzyme pills. And I think my gut would want me to have a little slice of Roquefort… tomorrow. Download BBC Sounds to listen to All Hail Kale.",,,,
1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46720303,"Children in the UK exceed the maximum recommended sugar intake for an 18-year-old by the time they are 10, according to experts.  This is based on their total sugar consumption from the age of two, says Public Health England (PHE). Children consume much more than they should, around eight excess sugar cubes a day or 2,800 excess cubes per year. PHE said a pudding tax should be considered if companies fail to reduce the amount of sugar in their products. The organisation also wants families to cut back to help tackle obesity, tooth decay and other illnesses linked to excess sugar. Choosing lower-sugar foods and drinks can make a difference. The recommended daily maximum of sugar for children aged four to six is five cubes or 19g. For children aged seven to 10 this rises to six cubes (24g) and up to seven cubes (30g) for those aged 11 and over.  However, UK children are consuming around 13 cubes or 52g of sugar a day, says PHE, based on results from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey.  Half of the sugar in children's diets comes from sugary drinks, sweets, biscuits, cakes, puddings, sugary breakfast cereals and higher-sugar yoghurts and puddings. Parents can try swapping: Making such swaps every day could remove around 2,500 sugar cubes per year from a child's diet, but swapping chocolate, puddings, sweets, cakes and pastries for healthier options such as malt loaf, sugar-free jellies, lower-sugar custards and rice puddings would reduce their intake even more, according to the Change4Life campaign website. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: ""Children are consuming too much sugar, but parents can take action now to prevent this building up over the years."" PHE is working with the food industry to cut 20% of sugar from the foods children consume most by 2020.  In May 2018, PHE published progress against the first-year sugar reduction ambition of 5%, which showed an average 2% reduction in sugar across categories for retailers and manufacturers. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme Dr Tedstone said PHE would produce more data later this year on whether the industry is meeting that target. When asked about the possibility of introducing a pudding tax, she said: ""If we see less progress, there would be a case for fiscal measures."" Matthew Carter, 12, decided to involve his family in an experiment. He spooned each of their daily sugar allowance into separate bowls every day for five weeks. When his parents, brother or sister ate anything, they had to check the amount of sugar in it, and spoon that amount out of their bowl and back into the original sugar jar. Find out how they got on here. Chief Operating Officer of the Food and Drink Federation, Tim Rycroft agreed that government should wait until the data came out before making a decision, adding that the number of lower sugar products on the shelves has risen in recent years. He also said he was ""disappointed"" PHE was focusing on sugar intake rather than the amount of calories in people's diet as a whole.  While breakfast cereals and yoghurts and fromage frais were among the categories meeting or exceeding the 5% ambition, some products in these categories are still high in sugar.  Consumers should check the labels on packaging to judge if products are high or low in sugar. The main sources of sugar in children's diets are:",,,,
1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46746552,"A clinical trial has been launched to see if a breath test could detect the presence of cancer. Researchers want to find out if signals of different cancer types can be picked up in patterns of breath molecules. The Cancer Research UK team in Cambridge will collect breath samples from 1,500 people, some with cancer. If the technology is proven, the hope is that breath tests could be used in GP practices to decide if patients need to be referred for more tests. They could potentially be used alongside blood and urine tests to help doctors detect cancer at an early stage, the researchers said.  But it will be two years before the results of the exploratory trial are known. GPs' leaders said the research was exciting but they warned patients that breath tests to detect cancer were ""unlikely to be commonplace at their GP practice anytime soon"".  Molecules called volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released when cells in the body carry out biochemical reactions as part of their behaviour. But if cancer or other conditions are present, the normal behaviour of cells is altered and they appear to produce a different pattern of molecules - and a different signature smell. The research team is trying to find out if this pattern or odour can be identified in people's breath, using breath biopsy technology. Their ultimate aim is to work out if different types of cancer produce different patterns - or signatures - which can be detected at an early stage. This is the start of the trial so we won't know for several years whether or not the initial results are promising. The science behind the test itself is not new. Many researchers around the world have been working on the possibility of breath tests for a number of cancers, including lung, for a number of years.  There are some promising signs that breath tests could detect pre-cancerous symptoms, but it is not yet clear how accurate they are. Any breath test used on large numbers of patients would have to be sensitive and accurate to avoid misdiagnoses and false positives.  In short, there is a long way to go and much more research needed on more people before a breath test will be appearing in any GP surgeries. It is possible that dogs could be also used to sniff out the odours given off by cancers, and other diseases like Parkinson's. The trial will start with patients with suspected oesophageal and stomach cancers and then widened to include people with prostate, kidney, bladder, liver and pancreatic cancers in the coming months. Healthy people will also be included in the trial. At Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, participants will be asked to breathe into a face mask for 10 minutes so a sample can be collected. The samples will then be sent to a laboratory in Cambridge to be analysed. Rebecca Coldrick, 54, was one of the first people to take part in the trial. She has a condition called Barrett's oesophagus and could go on to develop cancer. ""I was very happy to take part in the trial and I want to help with research however I can,"" she said.  ""I think the more research done to monitor conditions like mine and the kinder the detection tests developed, the better."" Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald, lead trial investigator at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Centre, said: ""We urgently need to develop new tools, like this breath test, which could help to detect and diagnose cancer earlier, giving patients the best chance of surviving their disease."" Dr David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK, said breath tests were a technology that had the potential ""to revolutionise the way we detect and diagnose cancer in the future"". Cancer Research UK has made research into this area one of its top priorities.",,,,
1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46739905,"When 12-year-old Matthew Carter saw how much sugar was in his favourite fizzy drink, he decided to involve his family in an experiment.  He spooned each person's daily sugar allowance into separate bowls every day for five weeks.  Then, when his parents and brother and sister ate anything, they had to check the amount of sugar in it, and spoon that amount out of their bowl and back into the original sugar jar.   When their bowls were empty, the family from Birmingham were not allowed any more sugar that day. The recommended daily allowance of sugar for a four to six-year-old is five cubes, rising to seven cubes for anyone over 11.  According to Public Health England (PHE), children are exceeding the maximum recommended sugar intake for an 18-year-old by the time they are 10. It says children are consuming eight more sugar cubes per day than they should - that's 2,800 more sugar cubes each year.  Matthew's mother Claire explained how the experiment - carried out two years ago - came about.  ""It all started because Matthew wasn't sleeping, and so we measured out the amount of sugar in the can of fizzy drink he liked. It was about four teaspoons."" Matthew, a keen football fan, had also been reading that for sportsmen, healthy eating was an important part of maintaining fitness. He had noticed that his friends were putting on weight, and he linked this to the chocolate they were buying after school.   It wasn't long after the experiment began that Claire started seeing changes in her children's behaviour. On just the second day Sarah, who was then six, announced she didn't want sugar on her breakfast cereal because losing any of her sugar allowance that early on, made the day a struggle.  Sarah started eating fruit, and she no longer cried if she was told she couldn't have something sweet like a biscuit.  ""Because she could see her daily sugar allowance in the bowl, the concept of a teaspoon actually meant something to her,"" said Claire.  ""The act of spooning the sugar back into the jar meant she could see how much sugar was in what she was about to eat.""  Claire and her husband Martin also lost weight over the five-week trial.  Matthew's experiment has had a lasting effect on his family.  ""Two years later I would say our sugar consumption is still pretty much under control,"" said Claire.  ""Other parents tell me that even when my kids are out at a party for example, they still make different food choices to their friends. I think they are just not used to a high sugary diet and so don't crave it any longer."" Matthew, who started the experiment said: ""I didn't think we'd still be talking about my experiment two years on. We don't use the bowls any more because we know how much sugar we should be having now - but the bowls allowed us to see what we were eating.""

1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-46427960,"When Jessica Share bought sperm from a sperm bank in order to start a family, she never imagined that more than a decade later she would meet the donor - and would feel a strong attraction to him.   In 2005, when my eldest daughter was born, I became the first lesbian parent I had ever met. This was the American Midwest, and the only lesbians I'd heard about with children had usually given birth to them in a previous, heterosexual relationship. My girlfriend and I, however, had had to start from scratch. Ever since we'd met we had dreamed about having kids together. We decided on four and together we chose their names. The next step was more difficult. My girlfriend suggested her brother-in-law could help. He was receptive, but I took a gay and lesbian legal rights course offered by the college of law at my university, and quickly gave up on the idea of a known donor. Courts had been known to give them custody rights, calling their gift of sperm an act of parenting. When birth moms died, children were removed from their homes to be placed with men they barely knew. Luckily, we discovered a sperm bank that shipped right to our home, where the anonymous donors signed paperwork that legally barred them from ever seeking custody of the children they helped create.  Because I was writing a doctoral dissertation at home, I would carry the first baby. We matched the donor to my partner - who was by now my wife - choosing someone of average height  and weight who had studied literature, had wavy brown hair, and liked sports. The donor listed his profession as a writer, musician, and taxi driver. My wife and I romantically imagined he was refusing to get a desk job, but instead collecting the stories of those he'd pick up in his cab, readying to write the Great American Novel.  Jessica Share spoke to Outlook on the BBC World Service You can listen again here There was little additional information on the donor, but the rudimentary health history that donors complete assured us we knew a lot more than we would have ever gotten from a casual boyfriend. We never saw a picture. Getting pregnant at home was fascinating - a home science experiment that I took seriously. Sperm supplied to buyers rarely tops half a lip-balm cap of liquid and it comes nestled in a 3ft-tall liquid nitrogen tank with an overnight shipping return label. Gloves are required for extricating the tiny plastic vial, which first sits on the counter and then warms to body temperature in the hand. The local pharmacist can supply a tiny syringe to use to inseminate. Because things that have been frozen aren't as robust as their fresh counterparts, revived sperm live just a single day. If an egg is not waiting for them, they will die.  Getting every last sperm as close to the egg as possible became a solemn monthly ritual. I would inseminate twice, just to cover the entire possible window an egg might be waiting. After all, it takes five full hours to even swim the length of a uterus. I learned this, along with every fact I could related to using donor semen to conceive.  Seven months later I was pregnant with our first child and my wife and I were overjoyed. I told my grandparents that we were expecting. My grandmother gasped, ""Oh, it's due in June!"" and my grandfather asked curiously about artificial insemination. We gave hardly a thought to the donor that we assumed we would never meet. My wife was particularly hostile to the idea of ever letting our children know him - she felt that love made a family, and I agreed. But we paid homage to his literary genes by reading thousands of books to our gestating bookworm. When Alice was born, she was perfect. All thoughts that the particularity of the DNA wasn't important went out the window. We agreed that we should clone this incredible being we had created with our love. We ordered sperm from the same donor and repeated the whole process, my wife giving birth to our second daughter when Alice was 18 months old. Both girls shared plenty of traits. Knowing how my wife and I looked as children, it became a fun pastime to pick out the characteristics only the girls shared: they were both extraordinarily tall, not average height, as the donor claimed to be. Both had long, thin mouths, small noses, electric eyes that look like emeralds under water, and impeccable vocabularies. But when the girls were one and three years old, my wife declared she was ending our relationship. There had been no conflict in our family, so I was shocked and heartbroken. She said she did not want to talk about it and there was nothing I could do to repair our marriage.  I continued parenting the sisters five days a week for a few years. But when Alice was 10, my ex-partner blocked Alice on her phone, cut off all contact with her, and refused to return her younger sister following a vacation.  This remains the case today. On my ex-wife's side of the family, Alice's grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins haven't so much sent her a birthday greeting in two years. Alice spends her days dreaming of the sister she was raised with and who she is afraid she will never see again. Alice knows more deeply than most children that family is neither genetically created nor forged through parenting alone. Parenting did not make her mama stay. And although genetics was a small piece of what her family looked like for a decade, that also seemed like an unimportant part of who she was. However, Alice wondered where her ancestors came from. My mother had often told stories about the family's Cornish heritage to anyone who would listen. Wanting to know what her genetic heritage was, Alice requested a DNA testing kit from her grandmother for Christmas when she was 11 years old. The results came back about eight weeks later. I clicked on the DNA Relatives section of the site, not thinking anything would come of it. But the first thing I read was, ""Aaron Long: 50%. Father."" ""Bryce Gallo: 25%. Half-brother"" was right behind. Of course, I had known this might happen, but it hadn't seemed likely. Before writing a note on the site, I searched for Aaron online to see what I could learn. There are a lot of Aaron Longs in the world, so I set to work finding ""the one."" I searched a professional social network for clues. Squinting at each Aaron Long, I wondered if I would recognise the donor right away. One of the sperm vials listed the date of donation (1994), which helped narrow down birth and college graduation years. There was just one man with a master's degree in literature in the correct age range, with the name Aaron Long. In his photo, he was wearing an olive-green silk turban and blowing a trombone. His profile said he was employed as a ""communications specialist"" and placed him in Seattle. A writer and a musician. On another social media site, I discovered a Seattleite named Aaron Long with the correct workplace and with photos of each of his school portraits through the years. There was no doubt. My daughters make that stupid face. I quickly wrote a message to him on the DNA testing site. It read: Hi Aaron, I actually have two daughters who'd match you (my ex has my youngest daughter; she's not on the DNA testing site). If you're interested in trading family photos, etc., we're available. I used the ""curiosity hook,"" thinking he'd have to write back to see pictures of my youngest daughter. Aaron wrote back immediately, sharing details I already knew from my sleuthing. He asked if I had any questions for him, and I asked if he was the shortest person in his family. I already knew the answer. He was. We agreed to become friends on a social networking site and Aaron sent a 50-page long life history, which I devoured. He'd spent several years in a band in the town where we lived. How many times had we walked past him in the supermarket, I wondered? I also wrote to Bryce, who had just graduated college. He told me he found Madi, a 19-year-old half-sister, and had also been in touch with other parents. He said there were a total of six children from Aaron, and that mine were #7 and #8. Bryce told me he had been raised with a little sister, but perhaps Madi, an only child, would be interested in developing a relationship with Alice? Alice had to be cajoled into writing her life story for Aaron, and getting to know her DNA relatives is only mildly exciting for her. She is grieving the loss of her sister. I try to tell her she has a special job of guarding these people, getting to know them, and keeping them for her sister when she is able to meet them. However, she would rather have her sister. A few months later, Bryce and Madi made plans to visit Aaron in Seattle. Alice was interested to see whether the siblings and Aaron resembled her. I agreed to let her take part. Aaron hosted a party to which he invited multiple housemates, friends from elementary school, high school, and college. All of his ex-girlfriends, and their new partners and children, were invited. They would all camp on the roof and celebrate meeting his biological children. I quickly learned that Aaron does not have a single friend he wouldn't welcome back into his fold. We visited the local sculpture garden, played a ""nature or nurture"" game that illuminated some shocking similarities, and took a road trip to an arts festival.  In spite of Bryce's initial protests, he and Madi vied for Alice's affection. During the vacation when they met, all three went out to grab dinner. Alice came back with ice cream from one and pizza from the other. Later, Bryce mailed her a star of David. Madi sent an amethyst. Both are symbols of the different things she has in common with each.  I had been dating a man for a few years who is also named Aaron David, with a similar last name. On our vacation, donor Aaron flirtatiously suggested there had been a mix-up at the Bureau of Boyfriends. I smiled and demurred. I was already in a relationship and was conscious that donor Aaron was an important person to my kids, but not someone who should necessarily be part of my own life. I didn't want to spoil it for them. When my relationship with old Aaron ended, I found myself wondering if my children's person could also be my person, and if Seattle was a place for us to land while we figured it out. Aaron's kindness and continued connection with his exes convinced me that it would be safe to give it a chance. One night, we walked the neighbourhood and sat in a local cemetery, talking about DNA, what the kids were like, and what our dreams were.  When heterosexual people meet and date and get married, they often look with devotion at one another and think it would be wonderful to have little people who look like both of them. I'd already spent a decade with those little people. I spent my first date with Aaron relaying their lives to him. I already knew him and knew he was just like these people I love more than anyone else in the world. He was already family in some ways. His smirk and his colouring are those of my youngest daughter. His empathy and socialism? My eldest.  It's hard to tell if DNA played a role in our relationship. I know that I am attracted to Aaron for all the reasons that seemed wonderful when shopping for him in a sperm donor catalogue years ago. He is thoughtful, persistent, and academically-minded. He is enchanted by words. He is empathetic, versed in stories about people and the strange things they sometimes do. He doesn't much care what's expected of him. He often plays his own music. To his own drum. Sometimes in a turban. How many people think a cab-driving musician and writer is the ideal genetic material? Alice and I moved into Aaron's co-op in summer 2017. It's such a large building that there was plenty of room for another of Aaron's bio-kids to move in. Madi, originally from the east coast, found Aaron's (and Seattle's) right-brained left-wing personality endearing and moved out this spring to live with all of us. We've even joined a Girl Scout troop with another of Aaron's bio-kids who is the age of my youngest daughter and lives about an hour away. I quickly discovered that as a mom, I would gladly take any of our new half-siblings right inside, make them lunch, do their laundry, and take care of them forever. They are the siblings of my children, the genetic aunts and uncles of my grandchildren. I don't parent them, but I feel inexplicably drawn toward feeding them. Some are the spitting image of Alice. Others resemble my youngest daughter. They don't all look like Aaron, but they undeniably resemble one another. Aaron's ageing mom has also moved in, along with her cat, Bill. Down the hall, Alice and I got a kitten. By making a family in all these new ways through the years, I've learned more about what family means than anyone would want to. DNA has become far more important than it was when I first picked a donor from a page. Yet it hasn't replaced the truism that families are built on love, not genes. Being open to that love is what ultimately makes a family. Everyone can be welcomed and stay in the fold. There is room for many different kinds of relationships.  Who knows how many more of Aaron's bio-kids there are - he's estimated there could be as many as 67. The building may eventually cease to accommodate all of them, but I've got the sandwiches, and the door's open. All stills provided by Jessica Share.

1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-46746394,"Scientists have found the most likely source of Yemen's cholera epidemic, which is the worst in recorded history.  Using genomic sequencing, researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Institut Pasteur concluded the strain of cholera originated in eastern Africa and was carried to Yemen by migrants. They hope the data will help estimate the risk of future outbreaks and be used to better target interventions. Since 2016 the epidemic has affected a million people and caused 2,770 deaths.  It has amplified the suffering of civilians caught up in a three-year civil war between forces loyal to the internationally-recognised President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who is backed by a Saudi-led coalition, and the rebel Houthi movement. As a result of the fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition, some 16 million Yemenis lack access to safe drinking water, sanitation and basic healthcare, and 10 million do not know where their next meal will come from. Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholera. In severe cases, the disease can kill within hours if left untreated. Yemen has experienced two waves of cholera cases since the war began, according to the World Health Organisation. To understand the nature of the strain of bacteria behind the epidemic, the researchers sequenced the genomes of 42 cholera samples collected in Yemen itself and from a Yemeni refugee centre on the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border, along with 74 other cholera samples from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. They were compared to a global collection of more than 1,000 cholera samples from the current and ongoing pandemic, known as the seventh cholera pandemic, which began in the 1960s and is caused by a single lineage of Vibrio cholera. The researchers found that the cholera strain causing the Yemen epidemic was related to one first seen in 2012 in South Asia that had spread globally, but also that the Yemeni strain did not arrive directly from South Asia or the Middle East.  This particular cholera strain was circulating and causing outbreaks in Eastern Africa between 2013 and 2014, prior to appearing in Yemen in 2016. The findings contradicted previous theories that the two waves of cholera in Yemen were caused by two different strains.  ""Knowing how cholera moves globally gives us the opportunity to better prepare for future outbreaks. This information can help inform strategies for more targeted interventions with the ultimate aim of reducing the impact of future epidemics,"" said Professor Nick Thomson of the Wellcome Sanger Institute. The researchers also surprisingly discovered that the strain in Yemen was less resistant to antibiotics than most strains of cholera that have cause epidemics, making itself more susceptible to treatment. Despite the ongoing war in Yemen, it has remained a transit country for thousands of migrants escaping deteriorating economic and political situations in African countries and seeking opportunities in the Arabian Peninsula. In 2017, more than 87,000 migrants from the Horn of Africa came to Yemen, undertaking the often-perilous journey across the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden.",,,,

Januhairy wants ladies to ""love and accept"" their natural hair while raising money for charity. Founder Laura Jackson, 21, said she has had a ""great response"" and women from all over the world have now signed up to take part.  The Exeter University student said she came up with the idea after growing out her own hair for a performance. ""Though I felt liberated and more confident in myself, some people around me didn't understand or agree with why I didn't shave,"" the third-year drama student said. ""I realised that there is still so much more for us to do to be able to accept one another fully and truly.""  She launched the campaign last month and now women from the UK, US, Canada, Germany, Russia and Spain are taking part. Ms Jackson, from Kineton, Warwickshire, hopes to raise £1,000 for charity Body Gossip's education programme, which teaches young people about body image. ""I just want women to feel more comfortable in their own beautifully unique bodies,"" Ms Jackson said. ""This isn't an angry campaign for people who don't see how normal body hair is.  ""It is an empowering project for everyone to understand more about their views on themselves and others.""  Among those taking part in Januhairy are University of Exeter students India Howland, Lila Boschet and Roisin McCay-Hine.  ""I think having body hair is one of many things women should never be made to feel lesser for,"" India Howland, 22, from Lymington, Hampshire, said.  ""I've heard girls apologise for having hairy legs before. ""But you should be able to embody your femininity any way you want to - no one should feel pressured into shaving.

""I expect that there will be peaks and troughs, moments where I will feel awkward, but it's exciting to see where it takes me,"" the third-year drama student said. ""I forget to shave quite often. But I'm looking forward to doing something actively instead of passively."" Roisin McCay-Hine, 21, from Fowey, Cornwall, said she was initially nervous about taking part.

1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46749232,"There is little evidence screen use for children is harmful in itself, guidance from leading paediatricians says. Parents should worry less as long as they have gone through a checklist on the effect of screen time on their child, it says. While the guidance avoids setting screen time limits, it recommends not using them in the hour before bedtime.   Experts say it is important that the use of devices does not replace sleep, exercising and time with family.  It was informed by a review of evidence published at the same time in the BMJ Open medical journal, and follows a debate around whether youngsters should have time on devices restricted. Most of the evidence in the review was based on television screen time, but also included other screen use, such as phones and computers. Meanwhile, a separate study has found that girls are twice as likely to show signs of depressive symptoms linked to social media use at age 14 compared with boys.  The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), which oversees the training of specialists in child medicine, has produced the guidance for under-18s.  It said there was no good evidence that time in front of a screen is ""toxic"" to health, as is sometimes claimed. The review of evidence found associations between higher screen use and obesity and depression. But the college looked at this and said it was not clear from the evidence if higher screen use was causing these problems or if people with these issues were more likely to spend more time on screens. The review was carried out by experts at University College London, including RCPCH president Prof Russell Viner. The college said it was not setting time limits for children because there was not enough evidence that screen time was harmful to child health at any age. Instead, it has published a series of questions to help families make decisions about their screen time use: Dr Max Davie, officer for health promotion for the RCPCH, said phones, computers and tablets were a ""great way to explore the world"", but parents were often made to feel that there was something ""indefinably wrong"" about them. He said: ""We want to cut through that and say 'actually if you're doing OK and you've answered these questions of yourselves and you're happy, get on and live your life and stop worrying'. ""But if there are problems and you're having difficulties, screen time can be a contributing factor."" Dr Russell Viner, president of the RCPCH, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""screens are part of modern life"", adding: ""The genie is out of the bottle - we cannot put it back.""  He said: ""We need to stick to advising parents to do what they do well, which is to balance the risks and benefits.  ""One size doesn't fit all, parents need to think about what's useful and helpful for their child.""  Parents should consider their own use of screens, if screen time is controlled in their family, and if excessive use is affecting their child's development and everyday life, he added.  A number of parents have been in touch with the BBC to say they disagree with the guidance and feel it does not go far enough. ""There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that screen time is damaging school performance and sports performance and dangerously addictive,"" says Andy, whose son is 14. Andy said he had restricted his son's screen time to Friday after school and Saturday, and, despite some ""grumbling"", there had been an improvement in school performance.  For tips on how to limit excessive screen time, click here.  The recommendation that children should not use the devices in the hour before bedtime comes because of evidence that they can harm sleep. The devices stimulate the brain, and the blue light produced by them can disrupt the body's secretion of the sleep hormone melatonin. While there are night modes on many phones, computers and tablets, there is no evidence these are effective, the college said. Overall, it found the effect of screen time on children's health was small when considered next to other factors like sleep, physical activity, eating, bullying and poverty. It said there was a lack of evidence that screen time is beneficial for health or wellbeing. Its guidance recommends that families negotiate screen time limits with their children based on individual needs and how much it impacts on sleep, as well as physical and social activities.  For infants and younger children, this will involve parents deciding what content they watch and for how long they use the devices. As children get older, there should be a move towards them having autonomy over screen use, but this should be gradual and under the guidance of an adult, the college said. Dr Davie added: ""When it comes to screen time I think it is important to encourage parents to do what is right by their family.  ""However, we know this is a grey area and parents want support, and that's why we have produced this guide.  ""We suggest that age-appropriate boundaries are established, negotiated by parent and child, that everyone in the family understands."" The college called for better quality research to understand more about how the content on devices, and the context in which they are used, affects health outcomes. Source: RCPCH The study on social media use and young people was carried out by experts at University College London and published in EClinicalMedicine. It involved nearly 11,000 young people answering questionnaires on their social media use, online harassment, sleep patterns, self-esteem and body image. It is separate to the RCPCH guidance on screen use and the review that informed it, neither of which looked at social media use. Experts not involved in the social media study said it added to existing evidence that heavy social media use may be harmful for mental health. But they called for more research to better understand if it causes depression, or if depressive people are more likely to use social media excessively.",,,,
1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46757704,"Authorities investigating the death of an 11-year-old boy in Brooklyn are said to be looking into whether fish cooking nearby could have been to blame. Cameron Jean-Pierre, who had a fish allergy, fell unconscious on New Year's Day at his grandmother's house. An official cause of death from a medical examiner is still pending.  But his family have told US media they believe he died after a severe asthma attack was prompted by fish protein he inhaled in the air. The boy's mother, Jody Pottingr, said her son suddenly became ill while visiting his grandmother's house, where a traditional Caribbean cod dish had been cooking. ""They thought that he left... I guess they forgot something at the house and went back, and he went in the house and then he inhaled the fish,"" she told ABC News. His mother says Cameron was first diagnosed with the allergy at school, after becoming sick after a lunch.  Ms Pottingr said she wants his story to serve as a warning to other parents whose children have allergies. Cameron's father, Steven Jean-Pierre, told the Washington Post newspaper that he gave his son a nebuliser device when he began to wheeze and gasp, but it failed to restore his breathing. ""My son's last words were 'Daddy I love you, daddy I love you,'"" he told ABC7 New York, while crying.  ""He gave me two kisses, two kisses on my face. He said, 'I feel like I'm dying.' I said, 'Don't say that. What are you talking about. Don't say that.'"" When police arrived they found the 11-year-old unconscious and unresponsive. He was later declared dead at a nearby hospital.  The US-based Food Allergy Research and Education group say about 15 million Americans, including six million children, are estimated to have food allergies. Fish is one of the eight most-common allergens required by federal law on food labelling. Although direct consumption is the most obvious source of risk from foods, the American College of Asthma and Immunology recommends people with fish allergies should also avoid areas where it is cooking, because proteins may be released into the air.   US reality television star Bethenny Frankel, who also has a severe fish allergy, revealed on Thursday a flight she was on was forced to turn around because of bass being cooked on board. She shared her experience in a series of posts and said she had warned the airline in advance.  Ms Frankel described the environment on-board as a potential ""death trap"" for sufferers. She shared the story of Cameron's death to her 1.6m followers as a warning on the dangers of airborne allergens.",,,,

But some parents have told the BBC they are frustrated by the advice and England's children's commissioner has said parents need more support. Andy, whose son is 14, contacted the BBC to say he was disappointed by the advice. ""There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that screen time is damaging school performance and sports performance and dangerously addictive.  ""I have had to restrict my son's screen time to a Friday after school and a Saturday, due to lack of focus at school. His default was to head straight to the Xbox (which I would certainly classify as screen time... it is just a game after all which most boys are engaging in across all devices). ""After some grumbling, he has settled in and we have seen an improvement in school performance.  ""I coach the under-15 football team and it is very clear, even with a 14:00 kick-off on a Sunday, who has been up all night on some form of screen."" Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner, believes guidance is sorely needed by parents. ""The fact that there isn't enough evidence doesn't mean we shouldn't have a view and try to work out what's best to do. Children are getting screens earlier, the average age to get a smartphone is now nine. Parents tell me that it is the one thing that drives them mad, causes huge rows, and they don't know what to do about it.  ""Parents are worried their kids will be socially damaged if they don't give them a phone, so they're in a tough spot."" The RCPCH said there was no good evidence yet that time in front of a screen is definitely ""toxic"" to health, although they did publish a list of questions families can ask to assess whether screen use is affecting their children negatively.   The questions are:  So if parents feel like screen time is having an adverse impact on their children's life, what should they do?  Last year, Anne Longfield published the Digital 5 A Day campaign, which encouraged the whole family to have a healthy digital lifestyle, including parents.  ""It can't be that parents have their phones in their hand the whole time. It works best if the whole family can look into a healthy digital way of life.""  Anne Longfield's tips for managing screen time include:  Ms Longfield is now calling on the government to put digital emotional resilience into schools in Years 6 and 7. She is also calling for tech companies to be more ""robust and have a duty of care for their users"".  Dr Richard Graham is a child and adolescent psychiatrist. In 2010, he launched the UK's first Technology Addiction Service for young people, and is on the board of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety.  He recommends that clients adopt the American Academy of Pediatrics family media plan, which allows a family to set limits together.  ""This plan helps a family to look at the sort of media you are going to access, rather than restriction without explanation.  ""There is good stuff online, which can make us feel well and healthy. A funny filter on Snapchat for example, can lift a child's mood. But there is also toxic content, and also the fact that screen time can disrupt important and necessary things like sleep, exercise and conversation.""   His tips include:  Dr Tara Porter, a clinical psychologist specialising in child and adolescent mental health, says she is concerned about screen use as a clinician and a parent.  ""Girls are being sucked into drama at a younger age, things said face-to-face are often less hurtful than things said in the online echo chamber, which can be escalated,"" she says. ""A focus on the best appearance can also lead to dissatisfaction and unhappiness."" Her tips include:  Concerned parents have a bewildering array of options to choose from when seeking to manage how much time their children spend on screens.  Some home routers and security packages allow parents to set time limits for devices and monitor and police what can be seen online. Some can be used to impose time limits but these can be very blunt tools.  Most game consoles and computers include tools that can restrict how long the particular gadget is used for. Finally, there are apps and other tools from Apple, Google, Facebook and others that can monitor how much time is spent on various programmes. Some let parents set hard limits so net access, apps or machines are locked at specific times.

1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46762980,"Smokers and problem drinkers who are admitted to hospital in England will be given help to quit or cut down, to reduce demands on the health service. The measures are part of a long-term plan to be announced over the next few days by NHS England. It said addiction to alcohol and tobacco were two of the biggest causes of ill health and early death. And the right support could save lives and help people stay fitter for longer. Health charity Ash said it was delighted by the plans and Public Health England called the move ""smart"", saying it would save thousands of lives and help the NHS survive into the future. Alcohol-related harm costs the NHS in England around £3.5bn each year - admissions to hospitals have increased by 17% in the past decade to just over 2% of the total number. But the use of specialist Alcohol Care Teams has seen a significant reduction in A&E attendances, ambulance callouts and readmissions.  The teams offer specialist help to patients on how to give up drinking and support to stay off it, which includes written advice, as well as counselling. That scheme is already running in Bolton, Salford, Nottingham, Liverpool, London and Portsmouth. It will now be expanded to 50 hospitals with the highest number of alcohol-related admissions across the country. And every smoker admitted to hospital - around half a million people a year - will be offered specialised support to quit.  This includes pregnant women and their partners. Recent figures show that 10% of women in England are still smoking when their baby is born, which can double the risk of stillbirth and increase the risk of miscarriage.  Areas of particular need, such as Blackpool where one in five pregnant women smokes, will be given priority over the next five years, NHS England says. Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, said: ""Drinking to excess can destroy families, with the NHS too often left to pick up the pieces. ""Alcohol and tobacco addiction remain two of the biggest causes of ill health and early death, and the right support can save lives."" He said the long-term plan delivered a ""sea change in care for a range of major conditions"" like cancer, mental ill health and heart disease. And he said it gave patients ""the support they need to take greater control of their own health and stay fitter longer"". The Royal College of Physicians said many patients only come to the attention of the NHS during their first stay in hospital. ""Every contact a health professional has with a patient is an opportunity to help the patient give up smoking - having a system in place to treat tobacco dependency with allocated funding will help make it happen. ""The focus on the management of alcohol-related disease is also very welcome. ""We mustn't forget prevention though and further measures to reduce harmful drinking are much needed."" Smokers' campaign group Forest criticised the NHS initiative as being ""tantamount to bullying"". Its director, Simon Clark, said: ""It's stressful enough being in hospital without the additional pressure of being hounded to stop smoking. ""Pressuring smokers to quit, especially if they're in hospital for a non smoking-related reason, is an invasion of privacy.""",,,,
1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46608205,"The death of a disabled woman who had all her teeth removed has led to questions being raised about the dental treatment of vulnerable patients. Rachel Johnston died two weeks after all her teeth were taken out at an NHS Trust criticised for its drastic full extractions from other patients. The story prompted many people from around the UK to contact the BBC to share their own experiences of hospital dental surgery on people with learning disabilities, with some also telling of loved ones having all their teeth removed at once because of severe decay. Elizabeth Palmer's daughter Julie Lake, who has severe autism, was seen by a hospital dentist for a check-up, but ended up having 17 teeth out under general anaesthetic. While her carers were within the hospital building, they and her family did not learn the extent of the treatment until the work had been completed. ""There was just no discussion whatsoever. For her to wake up and lose so many teeth... she kept looking in the mirror at herself afterwards,"" said her mother. ""For someone who doesn't have a real understanding of the world, it must have been an awful shock."" The operation took place about 12 years ago when Miss Lake, who lives in residential accommodation, was in her late 30s. Her mother thinks her teeth deteriorated because of a lack of daily general care but did not believe they were in such a bad state. Mrs Palmer was so unhappy with the treatment she hired a solicitor and ended up settling out of court with Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust. ""Julie couldn't have dentures - she wouldn't cope with them - so she just lost her teeth. There should be earlier intervention. ""Dentists should not be able to extract that many teeth [at one time]."" Des Holden, medical director at Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust said it had learnt from previous practice about how to deal with vulnerable patients. Wendy Lees was an intelligent, professional textile artist who took pride in her appearance. In her early 70s she paid for a private dentist to look after her teeth.   But a decade later, after developing Alzheimer's and having to be cared for in a nursing home, her teeth became so decayed she had to have every single one extracted. She died weeks after the procedure, on 13 September 2007, aged 82.  Ultimately the cause was connected to Alzheimer's but her daughter Charlotte said the deterioration of her teeth and subsequent operation made her final months ""horrific"".   ""There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that the operation to remove her teeth was instrumental in bringing forwards her death,"" said Mrs Lees. Wendy Lees, of East Molesey, Surrey, had to be looked after in care homes from March 2004 when her husband, Peter, fell ill from the strain of being her full-time carer. As she had paid for extensive private dental treatment, ""her teeth and gums were in pretty immaculate condition when she first went into the homes,"" said her daughter. But a failure to clean her teeth regularly meant they quickly fell into disrepair.  ""She just didn't get her teeth cleaned properly,"" said Mrs Lees. ""She was not easy to deal with, she could be quite aggressive, so she might have bitten the toothbrush. ""But when she stayed with us we cleaned her teeth, so it was possible to do."" When a dentist said every tooth needed to be removed, Mrs Lees said she was told several people in the home had also been through the procedure. ""It was said as if to reassure me but I was horrified,"" she said.  Mrs Lees has a disabled daughter, aged 26, and says the situation with her mother has made her very anxious about her daughter's teeth.  ""I see a lot of disabled people and it's really noticeable that a lot of them have problems with their teeth."" Robert Moss, 30, finds dental treatment and tooth brushing extremely difficult because of his epilepsy, tuberous sclerosis and severe developmental delay.  His mother Rose Salvin said he now faced losing all of his teeth because of a reluctance by dentists to treat him under general anaesthetic. Robert has had no intensive dental treatment since having a wisdom tooth removed five years ago. ""I've had to fight for him constantly since the day he was born,"" said Mrs Salvin, from Stockport. ""When he was in his 20s, the special needs dentist in Wigan said it was worth [putting him under general anaesthetic] once a year to treat his teeth. ""But since then he's seen another dentist who said his teeth had deteriorated so much he may need to have them all removed."" Five years ago he had a wisdom tooth removed and several fillings carried out, which his mother said made her cry because ""I felt like I hadn't advocated enough for him"". She says he has not had any dental work since, although his mouth has been checked over.  General anaesthetics carry risks when being carried out on all patients but the risk is greater for those with a pre-existing health condition.  ""I get to see my dentist every six months and get a scale and polish. So why do I have to fight for my son to have basic treatment?"" asked Mrs Salvin. ""I constantly feel like he is treated like a second-class citizen."" Malcolm Hamilton, a dentist with the Public Dental Service in Scotland, said he was ""saddened"" at reading Rachel Johnston's story and said prevention of dental disease ""should still be much higher on everyone's agenda"". ""All dentists would love to see a greater emphasis on prevention, but especially for those who are most vulnerable,"" he said.   ""We often have large and elaborate schemes to try to achieve this. But there is very little guidance for those who are not children nor in care homes for the elderly."" Mr Hamilton said dental services were all suffering from cuts to health care.   ""It is more expensive to provide dental care for vulnerable patients,"" he added. ""The treatment takes longer, staff require more training, and specialised equipment can be necessary, such as hoists and wheelchair tippers."" In 2015, NHS England issued guidelines on commissioning special care dental services.   ""My argument would be that this sort of service should be a core NHS provision, as it is in Scotland, not to be won by the lowest possible bidder,"" said Mr Hamilton.",,,,
1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46758997,"Researchers have identified two biomarkers that could help in the diagnosis of a heart condition that raises the risk of stroke.  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disturbance, affecting around 1.6m people in the UK. But it is often only detected after someone has had a stroke. The British Heart Foundation said the study could pave the way towards better detection of people with AF and targeted treatment. At the moment, an electrocardiogram (ECG) which measures the electrical activity of your heart, is usually used to screen patients for atrial fibrillation. This study, by researchers at the University of Birmingham, found that three clinical risk factors and two biomarkers had a strong connection with AF.  Those most at risk of the condition were older, male and had a high BMI. The researchers looked at 638 hospital patients who were recruited between 2014 and 2016 for acute illnesses.  They took blood samples and looked for 40 cardiovascular biomarkers and considered seven clinical risk factors - age, sex, hypertension, heart failure, history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, kidney function and body mass index (BMI). They were also all given an echocardiogram.  Two biomarkers stood out as a link to atrial fibrillation, the researchers found. One is a hormone secreted by the heart called brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and the other is a protein responsible for phosphate regulation called fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). The researchers say these people could be screened for the condition by testing their blood to see if they have elevated levels of the two biomarkers.  Lead author Yanish Purmah said: ""The biomarkers we have identified have the potential to be used in a blood test in community settings such as in GP practices to simplify patient selection for ECG screening."" Joint first author Dr Winnie Chua said: ""People with atrial fibrillation are much more likely to develop blood clots and suffer from strokes. To avoid strokes it is important for them to take anticoagulant drugs to prevent blood clotting. However, atrial fibrillation is often only diagnosed after a patient has suffered a stroke. ""Therefore it is important that patients at risk are screened so that they can begin taking anticoagulants to prevent potentially life-threatening complications."" Source: NHS England Professor Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, welcomed the study.  ""Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, a serious condition that causes over 36,000 deaths in the UK each year, but is often detected too late. This research has used sophisticated statistical and machine learning methods to analyse patient data and provides encouraging evidence that a combination of easy-to-measure indices may be used to predict atrial fibrillation. ""The study may pave the way towards better detection of people with AF and their targeted treatment with blood-thinning medicines for the prevention of stroke and its devastating consequences."" The research was carried out by scientists from the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and the Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences at the University of Birmingham's College of Medical and Dental Sciences and is published in the European Heart Journal.",,,,
1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46777387,"NHS bosses in England say a new 10-year plan could save up to 500,000 lives by focusing on prevention and early detection. GPs, mental health and community care will get the biggest funding increases to shift the focus away from hospitals. Prime Minister Theresa May hailed the launch of the plan as a ""truly historic moment"". But unions are concerned that staffing shortages could undermine the ambitions - one in 11 posts are currently vacant. And some senior doctors warned hospitals were facing a ""near-on impossible task."" Society of Acute Medicine president Dr Nick Scriven said he was ""staggered"" by the plans given the problems facing hospitals. Many trusts are missing all three key waiting time targets for A&E, cancer care and routine operations, and are struggling to balance the books. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens indicated there may be changes to the current target - that at least 95% of patients attending Accident and Emergency departments should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours - to take into greater account clinical need. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The problem with that is it doesn't distinguish between turning up at A&E with a sprained finger versus turning up with a heart attack. ""The top doctors in the NHS are looking at what are the most appropriate clinical standards to improve outcomes in emergency care. They will make their recommendations and then, on the back of that, we will meet them."" If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here.  The plan, unveiled by Simon Stevens and Mrs May, committed to giving a third of the extra £20bn the NHS will get by 2023 on GPs, community care and mental health. Currently they account for less than a quarter of spending, while hospitals take up around half of the £114bn frontline budget. Mr Stevens called it a ""practical, costed and phased route map"" for the decade ahead. Mental health is due to get £2.3bn extra of the £20bn, while GP and community care is to get £4.5bn. NHS England said that will help pay for: NHS England believes that combined the new vision could save 500,000 lives through preventing diseases, such as strokes, heart problems and cancer, and spotting them earlier to improve the chances of survival. As healthcare policy is politically devolved, the plan only applies to the NHS in England. But the other UK nations are drawing up their own plans. Under the government's funding system they are getting an extra £4bn between them by 2023. The prime minister asked for the plan to be drawn up when she unveiled extra funding for the health service in the summer to mark its 70th birthday. The budget will grow by £20bn a year by 2023 - the equivalent of annual rises of just under 3.5%. She said a long-term plan for the next decade was needed to ensure the money was wisely spent. Mrs May said it was a ""historic"" moment for the NHS and would help pay for ""world class"" treatments. But shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said the plan lacked both the staffing and funding to succeed and accused the government of ""mismanagement"" of the health service.  ""The NHS needs a credible fully-funded plan for the future, not a wish list to help Theresa May get through the coming months."" The ambitions are being welcomed. Prof Carrie MacEwen, of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said: ""It's good to have a plan which sets a clear direction for the NHS."" But unions have warned the workforce shortages could undermine the programme. Unison head of health Sara Gorton said: ""Without the staff, there is no NHS. ""Ministers must say more about how they plan to address the staffing shortages."" Mr Stevens told the BBC that the NHS planned to train between 25% and 50% more nurses and had five new medical schools ready to train doctors. He said: ""We've got to do a better job of looking after the staff that we have. I think people are under huge stress and pressure. We've got to change the way the health service works."" There is also unease that other parts of the wider health system have been cut - the £20bn promise only applies to NHS England's budget for frontline health care.  It does not cover other areas such as training and public health. The money made available to councils to pay for initiatives such as smoking cessation and healthy weight programmes is being cut by more than 4% next year once inflation is taken into account. What is more, the government has yet to publish its green paper on social care despite promising to in 2017. Councils and care homes have warned care homes and home help services for the elderly and adults with disabilities are at risk because of insufficient funding. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health managers, said the focus on out-of-hospital care should help relieve the pressures on hospitals.  But he added: ""If we are serious about helping people to stay well and live independently for as long as possible it is vital that we also see appropriate investment and support for social care and public health."" When it comes to this plan, there are probably two key things to bear in mind about Brexit - funding and staffing. During the referendum campaign, Vote Leave said the money saved in payments to the EU would mean an extra £350m a week could be spent on the NHS. When the prime minister announced the £20bn extra in the summer she said it was partly being paid for by a Brexit ""dividend"". But others have dismissed that suggestion. The Treasury has said a combination of economic growth and perhaps even tax rises may be needed. Alongside that debate, fears have been raised that Brexit could worsen staffing shortages. About 5% of the NHS workforce is from Europe. The government has promised those currently working here will have the opportunity to obtain ""settled status"" to allow them to stay in the UK and there will be a new skilled migrants system, similar to the one that operates for workers from the rest of the world.  But unions have pointed out that some lower-paid nurses and non-clinical staff, such as health care assistants and porters, will not be covered by such a system, because the cut-off is that the worker must be earning at least £30,000 a year.

Cancer Research UK's survey found 86% thought offering extra items for free encouraged people to buy junk food. Jaimie Treharne, from Ammanford, said so-called 'bogof' offers were one of the main reasons she put on weight. The Welsh Government said it was ""considering a range of proposals"" to help people stay a healthy weight. Retailers say they are ""fully committed to the health of their customers"" and ""playing a leading role in offering and promoting healthy options across their outlets"". The survey of 1,067 adults in Wales also found 68% of those polled thought temporary price reductions influenced them to buy unhealthy food. The results were published ahead of the Welsh Government launching a three-month consultation into how it should put in place its Healthy Weight, Healthy Wales strategy. According to the charity, 13 types of cancer are linked to obesity and about 1,000 cases of cancer a year are down to being overweight or obese. Obesity in Wales is worse than any other UK nation - 59% of adults are overweight, with 23% classed as obese, according to the National Survey for Wales 2016-17. Mother-of-two Jaimie Treharne, 31, dropped from a size 24 to a size 14/16 after changing her eating habits. She said: ""Buy-one-get-one-free offers were one of the main reasons I put on weight. I would buy biscuits and crisps that were on offer thinking they would last a few weeks.  ""That never happened, and I would binge eat as the temptation was too strong. ""I believe limiting the multi-buy offers on food that's high in fat will encourage families to make better choices and ultimately live healthier lives."" Ms Treharne witnessed her mother undergoing cancer treatment and, while it was not weight-related, she said she was determined to live life more healthily to stack the odds of not getting the disease in her favour. ""I want to do everything I can to see my children grow up and I know eating healthily will help me achieve this."" Ms Treharne, who is now a weight plan consultant, said: ""I can't look at my wedding pictures as that's when I was at my biggest. Something clicked one day and I decided I couldn't go on living the way I had been.  ""Now, my mindset has completely shifted and I now go out of my way to avoid the big supermarkets with multibuy offers so I can make healthier choices for my family."" Cancer Research UK say the offers are ""unhelpful and unhealthy"" and ""persuaded people to ignore their shopping lists and buy cheap junk food in large quantities"". ""By restricting special offers on unhealthy food and drink, the Welsh Government can do something really effective to influence the contents of our shopping baskets and help us all keep a healthier weight,"" said Andy Glyde, from the charity. The Welsh Retail Consortium said retailers were already ""fully committed to the health of their customers and are playing a leading role in offering and promoting healthy options across their outlets"".  ""Welsh customers benefit from a wide range of healthy, fresh and affordable options when shopping and retailers are leading the way in providing clear nutritional information,"" said Sara Jones, the Welsh Retail Consortium's head.  ""All of which helps customers understand their food and make informed choices."" The Welsh Government said it is ""committed to reducing levels of obesity"" and is ""considering a range of proposals for our approach to supporting people to achieve and maintain a healthy weight"". ""Our approach is to promote a positive healthy lifestyle throughout life, with an early focus on preventing overweight and obesity in childhood,"" said a spokesman.",,,,

Doctors also told the BBC they had seen cases of incorrect recordings of injuries and evidence contamination. Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove said the ""failings"" were ""shocking"". NHS England - which jointly commissions services - said it had not been made aware of the concerns. Following a sexual assault, victims are taken to sexual assault referral centres (SARCs) to be forensically examined.   The first three days following a sexual assault is considered the key forensic window for young children because their injuries can heal quickly and DNA is less likely to be retained. The BBC has spoken to eight doctors who wanted to blow the whistle on the poor care they had seen at privately-run SARCs.  There are many such centres across England, many of which are run by private companies.  One of the doctors, who works across multiple centres, said she was aware of 10 cases in the past two years where pre-pubescent children were not forensically examined within three days of being assaulted because there was not a qualified member of staff available. ""Ten children missing out on forensic samples is quite a significant number,"" she said. ""When you lose the forensics, that's something you can't get back."" Doctors from centres across England also said in the past two years they had witnessed incorrect recording of bruises and injuries and at least three cases of contamination of forensic evidence.  Dr Helena Thornton, who independently reviews forensic evidence for defence and prosecution cases, said she saw something that concerned her in a quarter of medical notes and evidence statements. Her work typically includes reviewing video recordings of genital examinations that have taken place at referral centres. ""I have seen one where gloves were not worn,"" she said. ""I have seen one which did not show the injuries that were documented to have been there."" Dr Thornton said another video showed a pre-pubescent child who was left ""beyond distressed"" after a swab was taken as part of a procedure that she says was totally unnecessary. ""If a parent thought their child was going to be distressed or hurt, I'm sure they would be appalled,"" she added. The BBC has learned that in 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service conducted an audit of forensic evidence, which has never been published.  An NHS doctor reviewed 13 cases that had gone to court whose examinations had all been conducted in one Primecare private centre in the Midlands. The CPS refused to provide the BBC with the audit, but under the Freedom of Information Act the information commissioner has now ordered its release. It revealed that only a single case provided ""acceptable documentation of injuries"" and the correct forensic samples were taken in just two cases. In one instance of rape, no samples were taken from the affected areas. According to the doctor reviewing the cases, one example of poor documentation of injuries ""would be fertile ground for cross examination by a defence barrister"". In a statement, the CPS said the centre ""fell short"" of standards but following the report they worked together and alongside the police to formulate an improvement plan. ""Significant improvement, involving this contract holder and generally, has been evident in the last nine years,"" it said. The CPS declined to answer whether they had conducted subsequent audits for any company in the UK. Allied Healthcare, who incorporated Primecare, said the audit was historical and the centre itself had been acquired three times by other providers since 2009. Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove said she was ""shocked by the failings the BBC has uncovered"".  ""Some of the individual experiences are truly distressing,"" she said. ""It is unacceptable that there is no standardised training for staff taking forensic evidence, despite it being recommended over nine years ago. I want to see this happen as a matter of urgency."" Responsibility for the care provided in centres is shared between a range of bodies. However, Baroness Newlove called on governments in England to introduce annual inspections of SARCs.  The Care Quality Commission - which regulates the healthcare provided but not the evidence gathered - said it had recently started a new inspection regime. But the BBC has learned that the forensic documentation produced at all centres will not be routinely reviewed, unlike at GP surgeries.  The Forensic Science Regulator said it now planned to set up a whistle-blowing hotline for people with concerns. In a statement, it said it had been ""working to drive up standards and will continue to do so"". NHS England - which commissions services with Police and Crime Commissioners - said it had not been made aware of any of these concerns.  In a statement it said: ""We would strongly encourage those involved to report these serious allegations to the forensic regulator. ""Sexual assault referral centres are important services which is why the NHS has tripled its funding over the past five years and has measures in place to make sure alongside the police that they are providing the care needed in a timely way.""

1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46793916,"A woman has suffered chemical injuries after she was mistakenly prescribed erectile dysfunction cream for a dry eye condition.  The woman, from Glasgow, had to be treated at A&E after she was given Vitaros cream instead of the eye lubricant VitA-POS.  Her experience is detailed in December's BMJ Case Reports journal. The report calls for doctors to use block capitals in handwritten prescriptions to avoid errors.  The woman was given a handwritten prescription for VitA-POS, a liquid paraffin lubrication, for treatment of severe dry eyes and corneal erosions.  The mix-up happened between her GP and pharmacist, where she was issued with Vitaros, an erectile dysfunction cream.  After using it she suffered eye pain, blurred vision, redness and swollen eyelid.  The mild chemical injury to her eye was treated in hospital with topical antibiotics, steroids and lubricants, which cleared it up in a few days. Dr Magdalena Edington, from Glasgow's Tennent Institute of Ophthalmology, wrote the report for the December edition of BMJ Case Reports. In it, she said: ""Prescribing errors are common, and medications with similar names and packaging increase risk. ""However, it is unusual in this case that no individual, including the patient, general practitioner or dispensing pharmacist, questioned erectile dysfunction cream being prescribed to a female patient, with ocular application instructions. ""We believe this to be an important issue to report, to enhance awareness and promote safe prescribing skills."" Although many prescriptions are digitised rather than handwritten, she wants to raise awareness that medications with similar spellings exist and encourage prescribers ""to ensure that handwritten prescriptions are printed in block capital letters (including the hyphen with VitA-POS) to avoid similar scenarios in the future"". Data released last year suggested GPs, pharmacists, hospitals and care homes may be making 237 million prescription errors a year - the equivalent of one mistake for every five drugs issued. The errors include wrong medications being given, incorrect doses dispensed and delays in medication being administered. The study said most caused no problems, but in more than a quarter of cases the mistakes could have caused harm.   Robbie Turner, director of pharmacy at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said the organisation was ""sorry"" to hear about what happened to this patient.  ""Mistakes are taken very seriously by pharmacists, who work hard to ensure patient safety, knowing the harm they can cause.  ""Most prescriptions these days are electronic, removing errors due to handwriting. Whatever the particular reasons for this error, collaboration between pharmacists and prescribers makes care safer and helps reduce mistakes."" Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said:  ""Most GPs now use digital systems to ensure the right medication is being prescribed to the right person, with several online prompts to make sure they are satisfied with the choice of drug, dosage, and length of prescription.  ""These systems have substantially reduced the likelihood of prescribing errors - but it is still important to maintain open and rapid channels of communication between GPs and pharmacists, so that if there are any queries regarding a patient's medication they can be answered."" Doctors are given guidance on their handwriting in a NHS training manual, which includes this test:  ""Write out the names of the following drugs in your usual handwriting. Get a non-medically trained friend to transcribe them. If they can transcribe them accurately then your handwriting is likely to be legible!"" The same document included an example of a misread prescription which led to the death of a patient in 1995.   A written prescription for isordil (isosorbide mononitrate) was misread as plendil (felodipine). As a result of complications the patient died within a week.",,,,

1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46804788,"Two gadgets that analyse the gases in people's breath in an effort to reveal how they should improve their diet are being showcased at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Lumen and FoodMarble are both pocket-sized devices that users blow into. They pair smartphone apps that tell people things like how well they are digesting food or burning calories. But one expert said such technology has yet to be properly validated by scientists. Lumen has raised almost $2m (£1.57m) on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. It has designed an inhaler-shaped product that measures carbon dioxide levels in the user's breath. The firm says this provides a way of monitoring a person's metabolism - the chemical processes that, among other things, convert food into energy. ""You don't need to guess how much sugar was in that kung pao chicken or how many calories you did on that run,"" explained founder Dror Cedar. Instead, he told the BBC, the app simply explains whether the user is burning carbs or fat. It then suggests recipes that help burn fat and, over time, Lumen learns what diet is most appropriate for each user. Lumen has been trialled by ""hundreds"" of users in the US, according to Mr Cedar. However, studies measuring the effectiveness of the product have not yet been peer-reviewed. It will go on sale for $299 (£235) this summer, though people who pre-order will pay $250. The app might charge a subscription fee in the future, but it will be free for everyone during its first year. More from CES 2019: Conversely, FoodMarble measures hydrogen levels in an attempt to make deductions about a person's digestive health. It was released in December. The firm has racked up nearly $1 million in pre-ordered devices, which have now been shipped. Founder Lisa Ruttledge told the BBC that hydrogen in the breath can be a sign that someone is having trouble digesting a recent meal. ""That's happening because there's fermentation happening in your gut and some hydrogen created in that process is exhaled,"" she said. The idea is to help people who experience bloating, abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Through revealing foods that result in hydrogen production, FoodMarble could help them tailor healthier diets. However, although such tests are sometimes used by doctors and dieticians, some question whether they are accurate. ""There is only limited scientific research showing that these validated tests carried out in a hospital environment can tell you what foods you are sensitive to,"" said Kevin Whelan, a professor of diatetics at King's College London.  This is because various factors can influence breath results - including the time taken for a meal to be digested, which is not always the same. ""Portable, user-driven machines that test breath gas have never been used in scientific studies to show what foods people may be sensitive to,"" he added. Ruttledge said that one of her firm's goals was to have FoodMarble become the first such device to be evaluated in a scientific study. Read and watch all our CES coverage at bbc.com/ces2019",,,,
1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-46806363,"A Love Island contestant who had a check for testicular cancer on live TV says his brother has been diagnosed with the disease. Chris Hughes was praised for raising awareness with his appearance on ITV's This Morning two months ago. The reality star says his brother Ben checked for lumps the day after Chris was on the show. Chris revealed the news on Instagram, alongside two pictures of the pair as children, urging others to get checked. Chris, who's 26, was flooded with messages of support from his 1.9 million followers, who thanked him for raising awareness of the disease.  In November he was also praised for stripping off and showing men that there is nothing to be embarrassed about by getting their testicles examined.  The reality star, who was on the 2017 series of Love Island, decided to go public to encourage other men to get checked, after having his own health scare when he was a teenager and three operations on his left testicle.  He revealed on This Morning that his cousin had testicular cancer and that both of his brothers were infertile.  He also admitted that he didn't get examined until he was 20 years old, saying: ""Because it doesn't come with a lot of pain it's easy to neglect. ""Everyone thinks they know their body. There's a right way to check them. I'll be honest with you it's not something you grab hold of in everyday life. You wash yourself but don't necessarily use your fingers to identify."" Testicular cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in young men, and Cancer Research UK says around 2,200 men in the UK are diagnosed each year. It is more likely if you have a family history of the disease.  But research from male cancer charity Orchid shows that 68% of men don't know how to check their testicles properly.  The Movember Foundation's advice is: ""If you notice a change in size or shape, a lump that wasn't there before, or if they become painful to touch, see a doctor."" Chris echoes their message: ""Testicular cancer is a silent killer, men need to realise this and check themselves regularly. It takes 10 seconds. Please do it."" A good time to check your testicles is after a warm bath or shower, when the skin is relaxed.  Cup your hand under them and check for swelling and lumps.  Roll each testicle between your finger and thumb and feel the weight. The NHS says most men's testicles are around the same size, although it's common for one to be slightly bigger than the other or hang lower.  There might be something wrong if you find a hard lump on the front or side of a testicle, a testicle is swollen, or if there's pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotum (the sack that holds the testicles). There's more advice from the NHS here. Jack Broadley, 26, discovered a lump on his testicle when he was 20.  He tells Newsbeat that despite his dad having testicular cancer when he was 24, he still didn't have the confidence to get checked straight away.  ""You'd have thought it would have made me go to the GP sooner, but it didn't because I was so worried about it being cancer."" It turned out that Jack had an aggressive form of the disease that had spread to his abdomen. As a result he needed three months of chemotherapy.  ""I was scared going through it all, I felt very alone,"" he says.     ""If you do find a lump, don't be afraid to go to the doctors and get yourself checked out. I was 21 when I was diagnosed and I know of a lot of other young guys who've been diagnosed. It is a young man's disease.""  As a result of his experience Jack decided to set up a charity to raise awareness about testicular cancer.

1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46782190,"Scientists believe they may have found a way to make cancer chemotherapy treatment less toxic to the body.  They have begun testing a tiny filter that sits inside a vein and removes excess chemo drugs from the blood once they have attacked the target tumour.  Experts say the early work, in the journal ACS Central Science, offers hope of avoiding treatment side-effects, such as hair loss and nausea.  So far, it has been tried in pigs, but researchers want to test it in people. If all goes well, those trials could happen within a couple of years, says scientist Dr Nitash Balsara, from the University of California. The tubular device is 3D-printed - so it could be tailor-made to fit the patient.  Its mesh-like centre is covered with a special coating that absorbs the drug, but lets blood flow through the device unhindered.  Tests in pigs suggested it mopped up a chemotherapy drug called doxorubicin, removing about 64% of the drug from the bloodstream. And it appeared to keep hold of the drug permanently. Continuously flushing out the device in the lab for a month after removal couldn't dislodge the drug.  That means it shouldn't leak any drug when the device is taken out of the body, say the researchers, who were funded by the National Institute of Health and the National Cancer Institute. The device would be inserted during chemotherapy and then removed after the session has ended. Each chemotherapy session would require a new device. Dr Balsara says the early results are promising and the device should work with other chemotherapy drugs if the coating is well matched.  ""We feel that removing 50% of the drug will impact patient outcome substantially,"" he added. Prof Steve Rannard, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""This work is an exciting new approach to reduce the side-effects of chemotherapy. ""Chemotherapy is a cornerstone treatment for cancer that saves lives, but can have the unwanted impact of damaging healthy as well as cancerous tissue, which can lead to severe side-effects.  ""This study demonstrates this approach can extract drug molecules from the blood and remove high levels of drugs that haven't been delivered to the cancer in animals, which could be an effective approach to address this challenge.   ""We now need to build a greater body of evidence to ensure this technique is safe before we can see if this could be an effective approach in cancer patients.""",,,,
1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46809517,"Cheap and widely used drugs for diabetes and heart health have potential for treating severe mental illness, a study hints. It showed the number of times patients needed hospital treatment fell by up to a fifth when they took the drugs.  The researchers at University College London say their findings have ""enormous potential"". But they, and independent experts, say the results now need to be tested in clinical trials. The starting point for the researchers was a list of currently prescribed medications that science predicts could also help patients with severe mental health disorders.  The team focused on: But rather than test them in trials, the scientists went looking for evidence in the real world. They analysed life-long medical records of 142,691 people in Sweden who had schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other severe mental illnesses. They then compared the number of times each was admitted to a psychiatric hospital clinic when they were taking those medications and when they were not.  Dr Joseph Hayes, one of the researchers at UCL, said: ""The paper suggests a 10-20% reduction in the number of episodes when on the medications rather than off."" The results, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, also showed a reduction in self-harm.  ""It's incredibly exciting,"" Dr Hayes said. ""It's got enormous potential and I'm pleased with the way it has turned out. ""But this is really just a starting point."" He wants the drugs to now be tested in large clinical trials, which should give a final answer. In the meantime, Dr Hayes says people should not go out and try to get the drugs themselves.  But, he says, there are many patients who should be on these drugs for their physical health who are not getting them.  ""The thing to do would be to see your GP about full physical health review,"" Dr Hayes said. ""There's a huge number of people that may benefit from a statin for their heart health and there's a potential knock-on for their mental health, similarly with metformin.""  Dr James MacCabe, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, said: ""These findings are very compelling.  ""The findings strongly suggest a potential role for repurposing these drugs to improve mental health outcomes."" But there is one nagging doubt, even from the researchers, around the way the study was designed.  A lot of studies compare one group of patients taking a drug with another group not taking it.  This one compared patients at different stages of their life when they were either on the drug or not.  The approach has many advantages but it could mean that when people are in a good place mentally and less likely to be admitted to hospital, they are also more likely to look after themselves and take other medications.  In other words, statins and other drugs could just be a red herring.  This is why Prof Naveed Sattar, from University of Glasgow, remains sceptical and says: ""I would be strongly cautious with these findings and would only change my mind if effects are proven to be robust in a randomised trial."" The research group took steps to counter this effect but agree clinical trials are the next step. Follow James on Twitter.",,,,
1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46814797,"Women taking certain types of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) tablets could be more at risk from serious blood clots - although the overall risk is low, BMJ research suggests. It found tablets containing equine oestrogen were linked with a slightly higher risk than other tablets. And patches and gels for HRT were the safest but were underused. GPs' leaders said HRT treatments were tailored to meet the needs of individual patients. They said women should not panic or stop taking HRT. Instead, they should discuss any concerns at their next routine GP appointment. HRT is used to relieve symptoms of the menopause such as hot flushes and night sweats, by replacing hormones that are at a lower level. The treatments come in a number of different forms, including tablets, gels, cream and patches. Most experts agree that HRT is a good and safe treatment - but there are some small potential risks, as NHS UK advice explains.  These include a small increased risk of certain serious health problems, such as blood clots and breast cancer. This study, by University of Nottingham researchers, said the increased risk of taking HRT tablets was equivalent to nine extra cases of blood clots per 10,000 women per year. The study looked at the prescription records of 80,000 women aged 40-79 who had developed blood clots and compared them with records of 390,000 women who had not. For tablet treatments, the risk was found to differ for two types of oestrogens.  The risk of blood clots was 15% higher for the treatments containing oestrogen manufactured from horse urine than for the synthetic oestradiol, for both single and combined hormone treatments. But there was no such risk for women using gels, patches or creams for HRT - also called transdermal treatment. The study said this was the safest type of HRT and yet it appeared to be underused, with just 20% of prescriptions for this type of therapy. According to the Royal College of GPs, most local NHS groups suggest prescribing tablets as a first-line treatment, unless medical issues suggest otherwise.  Dr Yana Vinogradova, from Nottingham's school of medicine, said: ""Our study has shown that, for oral treatments, different tablets are associated with different risks of developing blood clots, depending on the active components.  ""It has also confirmed that risks of thrombosis for patients using HRT treatments other than tablets [patches or gels] is very low.""   She added: ""Our findings are particularly important information for women who require HRT treatment and are already at increased risk of developing blood clots."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said the observational study was ""interesting"" but could not prove that cases of blood clots - or deep vein thrombosis - had been caused by the tablets. ""As such, it is essential that more research is conducted in this area and taken into account as new clinical guidelines are updated and developed,"" she said. She said current practice was to prescribe the lowest possible dose of HRT for the shortest possible time. This happened after ""a comprehensive discussion between the GP and their patient"", she said, when treatments were tailored to meet the best interests of each individual.  ""It's important that patients don't panic or stop taking HRT as a result of reading about this study but instead discuss their concerns at their next routine GP appointment or seek advice from a reputable website like NHS Choices,"" Prof Stokes-Lampard said. Dr June Raine, from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said details of the risks were included in the prescribing information for all HRT products. ""Previous studies have suggested a lower risk of blood clots with transdermal patches than with oral tablets, but these studies have included too few women using transdermal patches to allow firm conclusions to be drawn."" She added: ""Any new significant information on the efficacy or safety of HRT tablets will be carefully reviewed and the information provided to healthcare professionals, and patients will be updated if appropriate.""",,,,

A European ""party destination"" is one line of inquiry and health officials are trying to contact subsequent sexual partners in the UK. Both women have since been cured of their infections, which were resistant to the main therapy. Public Health England encouraged people to use condoms with new and casual partners.  One of the women appears to have been infected in mainland Europe. The other acquired the infection in the UK, but this case also has strong links to Europe.  Dr Nick Phin, from Public Health England, said it was ""unfair"" to say super-gonorrhoea was currently circulating in the UK. But he told the BBC: ""It really brings home the message that these organisms will spread globally and you can get them in the UK."" The disease is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex. Symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods.  However, vaginal and rectal infections often have no symptoms.  An untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy. There is no personal connection or established chain of sexual partners that links the two women. But both were infected with a version of gonorrhoea that was resistant to the first choice antibiotics - a combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone. The cases were not related to the ""world's worst case"", which was detected in the UK in 2018 after a trip to South East Asia. Dr Phin said: ""We tried to follow up contacts as much as possible, but it can be difficult - particularly if people don't have details you can contact them with. ""It is possible there may be other cases, these are definitely the first two we have picked up and at the moment there are two."" The bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoea has rapidly developed resistance to new antibiotics. There have been growing levels of super-gonorrhoea around the world with similar cases reported in Japan, Canada and Australia.  Dr Olwen Williams, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said: ""We are deeply concerned by these new developments."" Paddy Horner, from the University of Bristol, told the BBC: ""We've got to wait and see what happens over next few months and whether more cases appear, but it is only a matter of time before it arrives in the UK.

It is particularly cruel, therefore, that he faces the future with no such clarity about his health. Four months ago Olympic sprinting great Johnson had a stroke.  It was a mini stroke from which the 51-year-old has made a miraculous recovery - he is already spending his days paddle-boarding, rowing, cycling and running. But despite multiple tests and analysis from doctors, he admits he is living in fear because of one nagging question - why? ""We've sort of concluded that we'll probably never find that cause,"" Johnson tells BBC Sport. ""It's something I've had to come to terms with. If I knew what the cause was, I could potentially do something about it and feel much better knowing that this is what caused it and now I have eliminated that potential issue. Unfortunately, I don't have that luxury. ""Obviously that could create a little bit of fear, that I was doing all the right things before the stroke and now am doing all the right things again, even more. Yet it could happen again."" Fear of the unknown is not the only scary concept Johnson has had to face in recent months. He has also had to embrace a completely alien emotion - vulnerability. Over a glittering career during which he won four Olympic golds, and set world records in the 200m and 400m, Johnson was happy to talk the talk and walk the walk. One of his most famous soundbites was: ""They don't give you gold medals for beating somebody. They give you gold medals for beating everybody."" And at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta he raced to double glory in golden spikes.  Neither the words, nor actions, of a man keen to show weakness. ""I can't say 100% I am in a situation now where I'm totally comfortable being vulnerable,"" says the sprinter who was known as 'Superman' during his career - and at the 1997 World Championships wore a shirt bearing the comic book character's 'S' on a victory lap. ""It's highlighted that it's an issue that I have, this need to be superman, so to speak. This need to feel that people perceive me as being very fit, strong and able to do all these different things is a personal issue that I have got to still work through. ""My persona, personally and publicly, has been that I have got everything under control and I don't need anyone else's help, don't need anyone's sympathy. I don't like sympathy or empathy. ""I think one of the real lessons for me in this situation was being faced with the vulnerable position of not being able to walk. Needing help to do that and some of the regular normal daily activities of life was tough for me. ""But I realised that in order to get back to where I needed to be, people's help was something I was going to need, it was something I needed to open up to."" As Johnson is quick to point out, the unwillingness to show vulnerability is not all bad. Such steeliness helped deliver those four Olympic gold medals after all, and he believes it has helped him complete a remarkable recovery. It was early September when Johnson suffered a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). It is a mini stroke caused by a temporary disruption in the blood supply to part of the brain and results in a lack of oxygen to the brain. He lost mobility and co-ordination in his left side and in the days afterwards it took him 15 minutes to walk 200m - the same distance he ran in 19.32 seconds to win Olympic gold at the Atlanta Games of 1996. Four months on, he has already returned to his previous fitness regime. But for a move from San Francisco to Malibu, he would have already enjoyed one of his favourite winter pastimes - skiing. An important emotion during that rapid recovery was anger. It was briefly aimed at the predicament he found himself in, having adhered to all of the guidelines for avoiding strokes (eating healthily, drinking alcohol moderately, exercising regularly and watching your weight). Within 24 hours that frustration was channelled elsewhere. ""Having been doing all the right things like training every day and keeping myself in good shape while other people aren't, and they are fine and I am laying in a hospital bed having suffered a stroke, obviously you are going to be angry about that,"" he says. ""And I was a little bit, for about a day. ""I am able to recognise and know for myself that that is not going to do me any good and is going to make me feel worse. ""Telling yourself not to be angry is only going to make yourself more angry; you have to replace that with something and I was pushing my doctors to let me get into physical therapy as soon as possible."" As soon as possible meant - remarkably - twice-daily workouts within a week of the stroke. It's an approach he is also using to spread the word about the cause, working with the American Heart Association on an awareness campaign. ""My story can help people to be more aware,"" he says. ""One of the most important things with strokes is recognising the symptoms and getting to the hospital as soon as possible. ""Having gone through the experience I could very well see that an individual might choose not to go to the hospital. I didn't experience any sort of jolting moment of 'oh my god something just happened to me'. ""I just didn't feel quite right so I just chose to go to the hospital as opposed to waiting it out or sleeping it off to see if it would go away. That could have been catastrophic."" Understandably, Johnson says he and his wife were glad to see the back of a life-changing 2018 which, in the midst of his stroke, also saw them evacuate their home for five days because of the deadly California wildfires. But while Johnson is trying to live more in the moment, and to be thankful every day, much of his life will be unchanged. He'll still try to abstain from the junk food in the BBC Sport studio. And he certainly won't be taking on any wild challenges like the London Marathon. ""I passed on most of the snacks in the studio to begin with,"" he says. ""I usually brought my own instead so I will just continue to do that. Colin [Jackson] is the worst so without him in the studio any more, things got much better. ""I had no interest in running marathons before the stroke and that hasn't changed. The stroke didn't affect me to a point to where I am now crazy enough to go actually run a marathon. ""The best thing for me is to keep the risk factors at bay by continuing to eat right and continue to keep myself in great shape. To watch the different factors like heart rate, blood pressure and diet, take the medication I've been instructed to, and then just move on with life. ""I have approached my recovery with the same drive as my athletics career. But it obviously takes on more importance because you are talking about your livelihood and your quality of life. It's not an accolade. It's serious business.""",,,,

Naturally it reduces the chances of debilitating heart attacks and strokes as well as life-long diseases such as type-2 diabetes. And it helps keep your weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels down. I should mention it's cheap and widely available in the supermarket. Fibre - it's not the sexiest thing in the world but a major study has been investigating how much fibre we really need to be eating and found there are huge health benefits. ""The evidence is now overwhelming and this is a game-changer that people have to start doing something about it,"" one of the researchers, Prof John Cummings, tells BBC News. It's well known for stopping constipation - but its health benefits are much broader than that.  The researchers, at the University of Otago, in New Zealand, and the University of Dundee say people should be eating a minimum of 25g of fibre per day. But they call this an ""adequate"" amount for improving health and say there are benefits for pushing past 30g (1oz). Well, a banana on its own weighs about 120g but that's not pure fibre. Strip out everything else including all the natural sugars and water, and you're left with only about 3g of fibre.  Most people around the world are eating less than 20g of fibre a day.  And in the UK, fewer than one in 10 adults eats 30g of fibre daily.  On average, women consume about 17g, and men 21g, a day. You find it in fruit and vegetables, some breakfast cereals, breads and pasta that use whole-grains, pulses such as beans, lentils and chickpeas, as well as nuts and seeds. BBC Food: How carb-clever are you? Elaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland University of Technology, has put together this example for getting into the 25-30g camp: But she says: ""It is not easy to increase fibre in the diet.""  Prof Cummings agrees. ""It's a big change for people,"" he says. ""It's quite a challenge."" The UK's National Health Service has a page full of them. They include: BBC Food: High fibre breakfasts Well, after analysing 185 studies and 58 clinical trials, the results are in and have been published in the Lancet medical journal. It suggests if you shifted 1,000 people from a low fibre diet (less than 15g) to a high-fibre one (25-29g), then it would prevent 13 deaths and six cases of heart disease.  That's during the course of these studies, which tended to follow people for one to two decades.  It also showed lower levels of type-2 diabetes and bowel cancer as well as lower weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. And the more fibre people ate, the better.  There used to be a view that fibre didn't do much at all - that the human body could not digest it and it just sailed through.  But fibre makes us feel full and affects the way fat is absorbed in the small intestine - and things really become interesting in the large intestines, when your gut bacteria get to have their dinner. The large intestines are home to billions of bacteria - and fibre is their food.  It's a bit like a brewery down there, admittedly one you wouldn't want a pint from, where bacteria are fermenting fibre to make a whole load of chemicals. This includes short-chain fatty acids, which are absorbed and have effects throughout the body.  ""We have this organ set up to digest fibre, which a lot of people just don't use very much,"" says Prof Cummings.  The fact fibre and whole-grains and fruit and vegetables are healthy should not come as a surprise.  But there is concern people are turning their back on fibre, with the popularity of low-carb diets. Prof Nita Forouhi, from the University of Cambridge, says: ""We need to take serious note of this study. ""Its findings do imply that, though increasingly popular in the community at large, any dietary regimes that recommend very low-carbohydrate diets should consider the opportunity cost of missing out on fibre from whole-grains.  ""This research confirms that fibre and whole-grain intakes are clearly important for longer term health."" The study has been done to help the World Health Organization come up with official guidelines for how much fibre people should be eating to boost health and they are expected next year.  Follow James on Twitter One of the suggested ways of boosting the amount of fibre in your diet is to switch from white bread to brown or wholemeal. This is what has been happening to sales of those products, based on a succession of government surveys of household spending since 1974. From the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties, white bread fell while brown and wholemeal rose.  Since then, white bread sales have continued to fall, but brown and wholemeal bread sales have been falling for most of that period, although at a slower rate. So it looks as if while overall demand for bread has been falling, a higher proportion of bread sold has been higher fibre. Whole wheat pasta has made less of an impact on sales than higher fibre breads, with a survey for the British Journal of Nutrition finding that pasta accounted for less than 1% of the occasions on which people were consuming whole grains.",,,,

The University of Glasgow study looked at 274,547 patients with long-term mental health conditions, at surgeries across Scotland between 2013 and 2016.  Of those who missed appointments, 32.1% were addicted to alcohol and drugs. And among those who subsequently died, the average age of death was 49. Lead author Ross McQueenie said: ""Many people regard patients as being lazy or lethargic if they miss appointments. We think this is generally not the case.  ""People aren't making health appointments for fun. And if they miss an appointment, then their health needs aren't being met.""  An earlier study by Glasgow University, published in the Lancet, suggested GP practices in deprived areas coped better with missed appointments, with strategies such as offering on-the-day appointments for example. But deprived patients in affluent areas were often excluded. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: ""People miss appointments for a range of reasons - but this study highlights why it's more important to show compassion to people who fail to attend, rather than punishing them. ""For some, life gets in the way and they forget but others might not turn up precisely because of their health issue. ""We need systems in place to better accommodate for these situations and the starting point is having more mental health therapists based in primary care, where the majority of mental health issues are identified and managed.  ""The NHS long-term plan announced this week guarantees that our profession will receive a significant share of the funding.  ""We need these pledges turned into a reality as a matter of urgency.""",,,,
1901,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46823309,"The family of a nine-year-old girl who died from asthma has been given permission to apply for a fresh inquest into her death. It comes after the government's chief lawyer heard new evidence her death could be linked to unlawful levels of air pollution. Ella Kissi-Debrah lived close to one of London's busiest roads. Her mother said she wanted to get to the bottom of the health impact of air pollution on young people.  Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, a teacher, said: ""It's the right decision. Hopefully if we are successful, national government, local government and individuals have to do something about cleaning up the air.  ""In two weeks time, Ella would have been 15 years old. This is not going to bring her back, but it will allow us to make sense of why a child who was extremely healthy suddenly got so ill, and focus awareness on what is now a public health crisis. ""It is unacceptable that children in Britain today die from asthma.  We need serious measures to clean up the air like diesel scrappage, better public transport and more cycle lanes,"" she told the WATO programme on Radio 4.  Lawyers acting for the family said it was a ""hugely important"" step.  Air pollution has never previously been officially recorded on an individual's death certificate. In August, Ella's mother delivered a 100,000-signature petition to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox calling for a new inquest into her daughter's death. He said: ""I have concluded that there is new evidence which may alter the substantial truth of Ella's death.  ""I am therefore able to give my permission for an application to the High Court to request a new inquest, based on the evidential test being met."" Ella lived in Lewisham, south London, 25m (80ft) from the South Circular road - a notorious pollution ""hotspot"". She died in February 2013 after experiencing three years of seizures. During that time, local air pollution levels regularly breached EU legal limits. Her last fatal seizure happened during a spike in air pollution levels. An inquest in 2014 found she had died of acute respiratory failure and severe asthma.  However, the attorney general's decision has now paved the way for a new inquest to determine whether ""unlawfully high levels of air pollution"" were partially the cause of her death.  Human rights lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn, from the firm Hodge Jones and Allen, is acting on behalf of the family.  She described the decision as ""hugely strong"" and said the implications went far beyond Ella's case. ""A wider inquest would look not just at what happened to Ella and the circumstances into her death, but what steps were taken and what lessons can be learned. To look at the wider implications for children's health in that area,"" Ms Cockburn said. ""For me, this case gives an opportunity for those people in public office for protecting our health, to be asked questions and to be held to account and to come up with solutions so we can move towards cleaning up the air as quickly as possible."" One of the grounds for calling a fresh inquest was that permitting illegal levels of air pollution was a potential breach of human rights under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights - which protects the right to life. Ms Cockburn said: ""A new inquest could mean that a wide range of ""interested parties"" could be called to give evidence. This could include the local authority, the Mayor of London along with the local NHS Trust and Defra."" The attorney general's decision followed a report by Prof Stephen Holgate, a leading expert on asthma and air pollution, which found there was a ""striking association"" between Ella's emergency hospital admissions and recorded spikes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM10s, the most noxious pollutants. His report said there was a ""real prospect that without unlawful levels of air pollution, Ella would not have died"". Ella often walked to school along the South Circular Road and Lewisham High Street, a journey that would take 30 to 40 minutes. Or she would be driven and have to sit for lengthy periods in traffic jams. She was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit that followed a spike in air pollution levels. She was subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times over three years. Many of these coincided with recorded peaks in air pollution. Her mother said she had resuscitated Ella between 20 and 30 times while waiting for an ambulance. She said that Ella had been treated in five separate hospitals but no medical professional had ever explained that air pollution could be making her asthma worse. The next legal step is for the application to be taken to the High Court, which will decide whether it is ""desirable or necessary"" to have a fresh inquest.  While the High Court has the final say, it is highly unusual for the court to disagree with the attorney general. According to Ms Cockburn, decisions made by the attorney general are ""arguably unchallengeable"".",,,,

The French President Emmanuel Macron is launching the latest round to replenish the Global Fund in Paris. It is being called ""a decisive moment"". The fund says progress has slowed down because of wavering political commitment, and increasing insecticide and drug resistance. Raising the target amount could help save 16 million lives, it is claimed, as well as halving the death rate from these three significant diseases. The £11bn ($14bn) would be spent on medicine which treats and prevents HIV transmission, TB drugs and mosquito nets to protect against malaria.  The fund's executive director Peter Sands told BBC News: ""We've made extraordinary progress in reducing these deaths - but that progress has stalled.  ""Coming in new to this post, I've been really struck by the strength of political support for the Global Fund across many different capitals. ""I'm not at all complacent about the challenge of raising the money we need - and obviously the geopolitical environment is complicated. ""But we are confident we have a strong investment case - and a demonstrable level of delivering impact,"" he said. The Global Fund has generally been regarded as a success story in how it collects and uses global health funds from governments and other donors. But the investment case warns of shortfalls in funding, and it says this could threaten the third Sustainable Development Goal - an internationally agreed target to end disease epidemics, and create resilient health systems for all people. Malaria cases are rising, after years of steady declines. Two-thirds of all malaria deaths affect children aged under five. And although anti-retroviral drugs have stopped millions of people dying from AIDS, the massive increase in Africa's young population poses a threat of more new infections than at the height of the epidemic at the start of this century.   Tuberculosis kills more people than any other infectious disease - and drug-resistant cases form one-third of all global deaths due to antimicrobial resistance.

Those who ate breakfast consumed 260 more calories per day and gained 1lb more than those who skipped it, a review of previous studies found. But experts say a healthy breakfast can be a good source of calcium and fibre. It has also been shown to improve concentration and attention levels, particularly in children. Breakfast gives you energy, stops you snacking later in the day and supplies essential nutrients - so we are told. Its reputation as the nutritional backstop to our day stems from observational studies showing a positive link between people eating breakfast and having a healthy weight. But this new Australian research in the BMJ, which reviewed the results of 13 separate trials on breakfast eating, weight change and energy intake, found little evidence for those views. The findings of the Monash University research team suggest that skipping breakfast might in fact be a good way to reduce total daily calorie intake. They found that breakfast eaters consumed more calories overall and breakfast skippers did not have a greater appetite in the afternoon. And they say caution is needed when recommending breakfast for weight loss in adults - because it could have the opposite effect. However, the researchers added that there were limitations to their study. Source: NHS UK The participants in the studies were only followed for short periods - from between two and 16 weeks - and the difference in calorie intake between breakfast eaters and skippers was small. The researchers concluded that working out the long-term effect of skipping or adding breakfast to diets still needed more research. Prof Kevin Whelan, dietetics expert and head of King's College London's nutritional sciences department, says we should not get too hung up on calorie intake first thing in the morning. ""This study does not say breakfast is bad for the health,"" he said. ""Breakfast is important for nutrient intake, such as cereals and milk which are good for calcium and fibre."" But the BMJ research did not look at this aspect of breakfast. ""We are not talking about breakfast being the cause of obesity,"" he said.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47058919,"More people over the age of 75 should be taking statins, scientists have said, following a review of research. There had been a lack of evidence about how much the cholesterol-lowering drugs benefit this age group. But the review found they cut the risk of major cardiovascular disease in all ages studied, including the over-75s. Researchers said thousands of lives could be saved each year if more than the estimated third of UK over-75s who do take statins, were given them. They also said it could improve quality of life for many people. Cardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people in the UK each year, with two-thirds of these occurring in people over the age of 75. Statins reduce the build-up of fatty plaques that lead to blockages in blood vessels, though reported side effects and the extent of how often they are prescribed has attracted controversy.  The review, which looked at 28 randomised controlled trials - often called the ""gold standard"" of studies - involving nearly 190,000 patients, found statins lowered the risk of major cardiovascular disease in the ages studied, from under-55s to over-75s. There were similar reductions in risk for stroke and for coronary stenting or bypass surgery. Authors of the paper said there had until now been an ""evidence gap"" around how effective the drugs are for the elderly. They estimate that about a third of the 5.5 million people in the UK over 75 take a statin, when the ""vast majority"" of these would meet the medicine regulator's guidelines for being prescribed the drug. Prof Colin Baigent, one of the authors of the paper, said: ""One of the issues we have is that very often doctors are unwilling to consider statin therapy for elderly people simply because they're old, and that, I think, is an attitude that is preventing us from making use of the tools we have available to us.""  The benefits were strongest in people who have already had vascular disease. There wasn't enough data in people over the age of 75 who haven't had it to show a benefit. Experts have called for more data to guide prescription for these people. However, the authors said even a smaller reduction in risk was significant because the elderly have a higher baseline risk for cardiovascular disease in the first place. The more people reduced their low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol, the more the risk of cardiovascular disease was lowered, the study found. A 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol lowered the risk of major vascular events by about a fifth and a major coronary event by a quarter, when results from all age groups were combined. To put this into perspective, about 2.5% of 63-year-olds with no history of vascular disease would be expected to have their first major vascular event per year, compared with 4% of 78-year-olds. Reducing those risks by a fifth would prevent first major vascular events from occurring each year in 50 people aged 63 and 80 people aged 78 per 10,000 people treated.  Prof Baigent said there was an argument for giving statins to people over the age of 75 who have a ""normal"" level of LDL cholesterol. He said: ""In many circumstances, the person may be very healthy, they may be able to avoid having a stroke or having a heart attack simply by taking a cheap and safe tablet every day.  ""That may be a choice they're willing to take. At the moment I feel we're not taking the opportunity to offer that."" There has been controversy about statin side effects and how often they are prescribed, especially in otherwise healthy people. Common side effects include muscle pain, increased risk of type 2 diabetes and digestive problems.  It is possible to lower cholesterol levels without drugs by making lifestyle changes, such as by cutting down on saturated fat and eating more fruit, vegetables and fibre. Prof Baigent said side effects were ""massively outweighed, both in middle age and the elderly, by the benefits of statin therapy that we already know about"".  And he also said he was not calling for people to pick statins over exercise and lifestyle changes. ""I think it's not an either/or,"" he added.  The Royal College of GPs welcomed the research and said it was ""particularly reassuring"" to see evidence of the benefit of statins in over-75s. Prof Martin Marshall, vice-chairman of the college, said some patients would not want to be on long-term medication. ""But GPs are highly trained to prescribe and will only recommend the drugs if they think they will genuinely help the person sitting in front of them, based on their individual circumstances - and after a frank conversation about the potential risks and benefits.""",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47057341,"You may have heard an increasing number of people vow to reduce their meat eating lately - or cut it out altogether. This often forms part of a bid to become healthier, reduce their environmental impact, or consider animal welfare. A third of Britons claim to have either stopped eating meat or reduced it, while two thirds of those in the US say they are eating less of at least one meat. This trend is partly thanks to initiatives such as Meat-free Mondays and Veganuary. At the same time, a number of documentaries and high-profile advocates of veganism have highlighted the potential benefits of eating less meat.  But have these sentiments had any effect on the ground?  What we do know is that global meat consumption has increased rapidly over the past 50 years.  Meat production today is nearly five times higher than in the early 1960s - from 70 million tonnes to more than 330 million tonnes in 2017.  A big reason for this is that there are many more people to feed. Over that period the world population more than doubled. In the early 1960s there were around three billion of us, and today there are more than 7.6 billion.  While population is part of the story, it doesn't entirely account for why meat production increased five-fold. Another key factor is rising incomes.  Around the world, people have become richer, with the global average income more than tripling in half a century.  When we compare consumption across different countries we see that, typically, the richer we are the more meat we eat.  There are not just more people in the world - there are more people who can afford to eat meat. We see a clear link with wealth when looking at patterns of meat consumption across the world.   In 2013, the most recent year available, the US and Australia topped the tables for annual meat consumption. Alongside New Zealand and Argentina, both countries topped more than 100kg per person, the equivalent to about 50 chickens or half a cow each.  In fact, high levels of meat consumption can be seen across the West, with most countries in Western Europe consuming between 80 and 90 kilograms of meat per person. At the other end of the spectrum, many of the world's poorest countries eat very little meat.  The average Ethiopian consumes just 7kg, Rwandans 8kg and Nigerians 9kg. This is 10 times less than the average European.  For those in low-income countries, meat is still very much a luxury. These figures represent the amount of meat per head available for consumption, but do not account for any food wasted at home or on the shop floor. In reality, people eat slightly less meat than this, but it's still a close estimate. It is clear that the richest countries eat a lot of meat, and those on low incomes eat little.  This has been the case for 50 years or more. So why are we collectively eating so much more meat? This trend has been largely driven from a growing band of middle-income countries.  Rapidly growing nations like China and Brazil have seen significant economic growth in recent decades, and a large rise in meat consumption. In Kenya, meat consumption has changed little since 1960.  By contrast, the average person in 1960s China consumed less than 5kg a year. By the late 1980s this had risen to 20kg, and in the last few decades this has more than tripled to over 60kg.  The same thing happened in Brazil, where meat consumption has almost doubled since 1990 - overtaking almost all Western countries in the process.  India is one notable exception. While average incomes have tripled since 1990, meat consumption hasn't followed suit.  It is a misconception that the majority of India is vegetarian - two thirds of Indians do eat at least some meat, according to a nationwide survey. Nonetheless, the amount of meat consumed in India has remained small. At less than 4kg per person, it is the lowest in the world. This is likely to be partly down to cultural factors for some in India, including not eating certain types of meat for religious reasons. Many in Europe and North America say they are trying to cut down on meat, but is it working? Not really, according to statistics. Recent data from the United States Department for Agriculture (USDA) suggests meat consumption per head has actually increased over the last few years.  While we may think that meat is becoming less popular, US consumption in 2018 was close to its highest in decades.  It's a similar picture with meat consumption in the EU. While Western consumption of meat is steady, or slightly increasing, the types of meat eaten are changing.  This means less red meat - beef and pork - and more poultry.  In the US, poultry now accounts for half of meat consumption, up from a quarter in the 1970s. These types of substitution could be good news for health and the environment. More stories like this In some circumstances, eating meat can be beneficial. Moderate quantities of meat and dairy can improve people's health, particularly in lower-income countries where diets may lack variety.  But in many countries, meat consumption goes far beyond basic nutritional benefits.  In fact, it could be a health risk. Studies have linked excess red and processed meat consumption with increased risk of heart disease, stroke and certain types of cancer.  Substituting chicken for beef or bacon could be a positive step.  This swap is also better for the environment as cows, in particular, are inefficient converters of feed to meat.  Compared to chicken, beef has anywhere in the range of three to 10 times as much impact on land use, water and greenhouse gas emissions. Pork is somewhere in between the two. A future where meat consumption is sustainable and balanced across countries would require major changes. This would mean not only a shift in the types of meat we eat, but also how much.  Essentially, meat would have to become more of a luxury again. About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.

Ros and Josh Hannam's daughter Lola was diagnosed shortly after she was born. Although they had some support from Monmouthshire council, the couple from Caldicot will have to pay for British Sign Language (BSL) classes themselves. Mrs Hannam said people found it ""ridiculous"" when she told them they had to pay. The Welsh Government said it would review BSL funding. ""I think the first thing we felt [after Lola was diagnosed] was probably devastation,"" Mrs Hannam said. ""She was going to have extra requirements and extra needs that we weren't anticipating. ""I think once we got over the initial devastation, it was about what can we do to make this good?"" The couple got some basic language support through the council's Sensory Communication Service, but how much parents have to pay towards BSL classes depends on where they live. Some get it for free, but others have to foot the full cost themselves. Mrs Hannam said: ""I was pretty taken aback. If we say to someone we have to fund it ourselves, the general reaction is 'What? That's ridiculous'. ""Nobody can afford that kind of money and I think that's how we felt as well. ""I'm spending most of my time trying to organise, trying to raise funds, organise raffle prizes just to be able to communicate with my daughter."" Jade Kilduff, who is campaigning for basic sign language to be compulsory in schools, said she supports Mr and Mrs Hannam's campaign. The 17-year-old has begun teaching  her three-year-old brother Christian, who has cerebral palsy and a brain injury, how to communicate using Makaton, which is based on BSL. Jade teaches Christian a sign a day, and posts videos on social media via her page Sign along with us. Jade said: ""My wish is that one day everyone knows just the basic signs at least. ""I'd hate a world for him [Christian] where only a select few people knew enough signs to be able to understand him, that must be so isolating. ""I am determined to make a change and to make the world a better place for my brother and other children and adults with communication difficulties. ""I only started Sign along with us a month ago and the positive response has been overwhelming, lots of people are copying the signs and schools showing them in assemblies."" Debbie Thomas from the National Deaf Children's Society said parents faced a ""postcode lottery"". She added: ""We feel that the Welsh Government has a responsibility to make it very clear to local authorities that this is exactly the type of support they should be providing to families of young deaf children, because it's crucial from helping their social development, to helping their educational development."" A spokesman said the Welsh Government would be ""reviewing the provision of BSL for adults in Wales in the coming months. This work will determine the costs and demand for delivering BSL and will help develop a fairer and more equitable system"".",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47076043,"Female genital mutilation (FGM) is increasingly being performed on babies and infants in the UK, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has been told. FGM expert and barrister Dr Charlotte Proudman said it was ""almost impossible to detect"" as the girls were not in school or old enough to report it. In one report, in Yorkshire, a victim was just one month old. The National FGM Centre said it was ""not surprised"" that victims may be younger now. Charity Barnardo's and the Local Government Association - which together run the centre - said its community engagement was ""key to protecting girls"". Their comments follow the first UK conviction for FGM. The mother of a three-year-old girl was found guilty at the Old Bailey on Friday of mutilating her daughter. Her partner was acquitted. FGM includes the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Dr Proudman said there was ""a lot of anecdotal data which shows FGM is now being performed on babies. ""These girls are not at school, they are not at nursery, and so it's very difficult for any public authority to become aware,"" she added. ""By performing it at such a young age, they're evading the law."" In response to a Freedom of Information request, West Yorkshire Police said a quarter of its FGM reports (17) between 2015 and 2017 involved victims aged three or under. The National FGM Centre said there was ""anecdotal evidence from some communities that FGM laws can be circumnavigated by performing the procedure on girls at a much younger age"". ""The girls are unable to report, the cut heals quicker and prosecution is much harder once evidence comes to light and the girl is older.  ""There needs to be much greater recognition of this issue across different areas of the UK."" Experts say authorities need a more joined-up approach when dealing with FGM. It is claimed children's services can be unsure when to intervene. Doctors are not always reporting it to the police - and even if they do, officers do not always know what to do. ""People are concerned about cultural sensitivities, worried about being branded racist, and it's being performed on a very private area,"" Dr Proudman said, explaining why it has taken many years for the first UK conviction to arrive. Figures seen by the Victoria Derbyshire programme show that 939 calls were made to emergency services to report FGM between 2014 and 2018. But the Crown Prosecution Service has only received 36 referrals for FGM from the police since 2010.  One 2015 report by City, University of London estimated 137,000 women and girls in England have been victims of FGM. Hibo Wadere was six when she was forced to undergo FGM. Some may find her words distressing. Ms Wadere said she was told a special party was being thrown for her. She described how that morning she was ""held down, your legs yanked apart and your genitals being ripped apart. ""You saw the blood, you saw the cutter with blood on her hands,"" she added. ""She just kept on cutting as if it was normal for her to hear the screams. ""It was the cruellest thing for a child to experience. ""It stays with you for life. It's a life sentence."" Lawyer Linda Weil-Curiel, whose work has led to more than 100 FGM convictions in France, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme the UK should follow the country's tougher stance. In France, all children undergo regular genital checks until the age of six and doctors are expected to report any cases of physical abuse. ""In [the UK] system you need the victim to come and complain, but how can you expect a child to complain against her parents?,"" she asked. ""It's for society to protect children, to take the initiative as soon as mutilation is documented - and the only way that happens is to have a medical examination.   ""There might be people horrified at the thought of their child undergoing a check. I don't understand that - we are talking about the health of children and babies,"" she added. But the National FGM Centre said the key way to prevent instances of the abuse was to change ""the views of affected communities"" and to form ""a huge cultural shift in groups where FGM is commonly practised"". It said it was helping to train professionals to be ""aware of how to broach the topic, spot the signs and respond appropriately when there is a concern"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We will not tolerate FGM and not rest until perpetrators of this horrific crime are brought to justice. He said the UK's first conviction for FGM came after ""the government introduced tougher rules to criminalise this medieval practice.""

1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47061079,"Cancers linked to obesity are rising at a faster rate in millennials than in older generations in the United States, the American Cancer Society has said. It said a steep rise in obesity in the past 40 years may have increased cancer risk in younger generations. And it warned the problem could set back recent progress on cancer. The Society studied millions of health records from 1995 to 2014, publishing its findings in The Lancet Public Health. In the last few decades, there has been mounting evidence that certain cancers can be linked to obesity. Researchers found that the rates of six out of 12 obesity-related cancers (colorectal, uterine, gallbladder, kidney, pancreatic and multiple myeloma - a blood cancer) all went up, particularly in people under the age of 50.  And they found steeper rises in successively younger generations aged 25 to 49 - and particularly in millennials, in their 20s and 30s.  For example, the risk of colorectal, uterine and gallbladder cancers has doubled for millennials compared to baby boomers, now aged 50 to 70, at the same age. Some of these cancers increased in people over 50 too, but the rises were not as steep.  Researchers say this trend may be down to the rapid rise in obesity in the last few decades with ""younger generations worldwide experiencing an earlier and longer exposure to the dangers of extra weight"".  Dr Ahmedin Jemal, from the American Cancer Society, said: ""Our findings expose a recent change that could serve as a warning of an increased burden of obesity-related cancers to come in older adults.  ""Most cancers occur in older adults, which means that as the young people in our study age, the burden of obesity-related cancer cases and deaths are likely to increase even more."" But the researchers could not explain why the rates of only half of the 12 obesity-related cancers had increased. Meanwhile, they found cancers linked to smoking and infections were declining in younger age groups.  Dr Brenda Birmann, from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told the Lancet Public Health that it was possible that risk factors other than obesity could play a part and this warranted further investigation. ""Importantly, the findings suggest the need for further close epidemiological monitoring of cancer incidence trends in younger adults,"" she said. According to the charity Cancer Research UK, obesity is the second biggest preventable cause of cancer in the UK, after smoking.  Research suggests bowel cancer, womb cancer, oesophageal (food pipe) cancer, cancer of the kidney, liver, upper stomach, gallbladder, ovarian, thyroid, meningioma (a type of brain tumour) and multiple myeloma (a type of blood cancer) and breast cancer in women after the menopause have all been linked to obesity.  Researchers say the risk increases as people get more overweight.  But of course, obesity is only one factor - the environment, genetics and other issues can also come into play. Not everyone who gets these cancers will be overweight and everyone who is obese will not necessarily get these cancers.  And scientists are clear that losing even small amounts of weight can help reduce the risk of cancer.  Scientists still have a lot of questions to answer but there are currently three main theories about this.  Extra body fat does not just sit in the body doing nothing.  Fat cells help store energy, but they can also send chemical signals to other parts of the body. These signals may tell cells to divide more quickly, which can put people at risk of cancer.  In other words:",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47115039,"The government must use its powers to break a deadlock in making a life-extending drug available to people with cystic fibrosis, campaigners say. Vertex, which makes Orkambi, has refused a £500m offer for the drug over five years - the ""largest commitment"" the NHS has ever made. Those affected want other drug firms to be asked to make a cheaper version. The Department of Health said its approach ""remains urging Vertex to accept NHS England's generous offer"". Vertex said it was ""determined to find a solution that allows the NHS to provide patient access to our precision medicines across the UK with budget certainty, and also allows Vertex to continue its research and focus on a cure for CF [cystic fibrosis] and other serious diseases"".  It currently charges £100,000 for a year's treatment with Orkambi. Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening genetic condition that causes fatal lung damage and affects around 10,400 people in the UK. Only around half of those with the condition live to celebrate their 40th birthday. Christina Walker's son Luis, eight, was born with it. She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme his medical regime takes up to four hours a day. ""Every day he takes 22 tablets, three nebulisers, two inhalers, nasal sprays and lots of supplements,"" she said. ""Those are the good days. ""A bad day will see Luis in hospital. A cough or cold will have turned serious, his lung function will plummet, he'll be off school for weeks, missing not just classes, but birthdays and time spent with friends - the little things that make being eight years old so much fun. ""Or it might be like last week when he had a stomach bug and was reduced to skin and bones as his weak body sheds the tiny amount of weight he'd been able to put on previously."" The drug Orkambi is licensed to treat cystic fibrosis in patients from two-year-olds to adults, who have a specific genetic mutation known as F508del. This causes the production of an abnormal protein that disrupts how water and chloride are transported in the body. The drug has been shown in clinical trials to improve lung function and respiratory symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. It is the first of a string of drugs that have been developed, with newer ones expected to be even more effective.  Ms Walker said for Luis it would be ""life-changing"". The manufacturers Vertex Pharmaceuticals want the NHS to pay £105,000 per patient per year, and have rejected the NHS's offer of £500m over five years. Campaigners want the government to set aside Vertex's patent to allow cheaper versions of Orkambi to be made. This is backed by Conservative MP Bill Wiggin, who will ask the government to invoke Crown Use in an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on Monday - which would allow this to happen. Vertex said in a statement: ""To invoke Crown Use and provide third parties access to Vertex's intellectual property would seriously undermine our ability to achieve these goals and would significantly weaken incentives for future innovation."" Ms Walker - who campaigns on the issue - told Victoria Derbyshire: ""[Other] suppliers are making the drug already for £5,000."" She added: ""We have a chance for [Luis's] future to be different."" The Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement that ""it is absolutely right that patients should have access to cost-effective, innovative medicines on the NHS at a price we can afford. ""Despite being offered in the region of £500m over five years - the largest ever commitment of its kind in the 70-year history of the NHS - Vertex has refused to accept, putting Orkambi out of reach of patients. ""We're aware there may be other avenues open to resolve this issue, but our approach remains urging Vertex to accept NHS England's generous offer."" A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""We understand how difficult it must be for families affected by cystic fibrosis. ""This is why it is so important that as with all companies seeking NHS approval for treatments of this kind, Vertex must fully engage with the NICE [The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] process.""

1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47072413,"The coroner for Northern Ireland has called the rising number of deaths linked to fake versions of the anti-anxiety drug, Xanax, ""an escalating crisis"".  Joe McCrisken says he is signing off an alprazolam-related death nearly once a week.   He says ""most of the deaths"" are caused by counterfeit versions of Xanax, the brand name for the drug alprazolam. ""The deaths are a very tiny tip of what is a very huge iceberg,"" he says. Xanax is used to treat anxiety and panic attacks. It is not available on the NHS. It is a powerful tranquiliser. But it can be obtained on private prescription in the UK, is widely prescribed in the US, and counterfeit versions circulate on the black market.  Last year, the BBC found that children as young as 11 were being treated by ambulance services after taking fake versions of it. Mr McCrisken said the number of deaths linked to alprazolam in Northern Ireland had risen from one in 2015, to 26 in 2017. ""In 2018, it's looking like that might double to somewhere around 50 provisionally.  ""That's an indication of not an emerging crisis, but an escalating crisis. It's a very real public health concern."" Paul, 20, started taking counterfeit Xanax from the age of 17 after being introduced to it by a friend. He said he initially took it to help with his anxiety. ""It made me feel happy. It made me feel like a different person, as if all your problems have gone, it made you feel like you needed it. But at the same time like you didn't really need it. But that's when all the bad stuff started happening.  ""My head was away. I started fighting with my family, I tried to stab my mum, I was going to stab my dad, getting into fights, getting into debt."" Paul admitted to taking other drugs - but said fake Xanax had the worst effect on him as he had no idea whether it had been cut with other substances. ""It's made me psychotic and stuff and made me not be able to control my anger.  ""People nowadays are just playing Russian roulette with tablets, they're just trying to see what the next hit is.  ""But it's not worth it. Too many young people are dying from the fake stuff going about."" Paul says he is exceptionally lucky to still be alive, considering his abuse of the tranquiliser and other drugs. ""One night I took 56 of them. That was on a Friday. And I didn't wake up until the Sunday. That's when I went round to my Mum's and smashed her TV, then had her pinned up against the car. I didn't know what I was doing.  ""I didn't think I would make it to the age of 20 because of the stuff I was doing. They make you suicidal.  ""Even after I am off it, I still have to deal with the voices in my head. I have to still deal with all the mental health problems.""  Paul said dealers would offer the drug to passers-by on the street. ""It's silly because you'll have 13-year-old kids running about trying to sell you the drug on the street corners.""  Paul underwent a residential rehab treatment and has been clean for just under a year. Mr McCrisken said when he started the job three years ago, he had never heard of counterfeit Xanax. ""The alprazolam powder is being obtained from the Far East, I was told in one inquest, and then pressed in the UK and sold on the dark web."" Because Xanax is not available on the NHS in the UK, Mr McCrisken believes almost all the deaths linked to the drug in Northern Ireland are from counterfeit versions. ""We can't underplay this; it's hugely concerning. The sheer escalation of deaths, involving alprazolam as well as other drugs, but particularly that one, as a coroner, concerns me.  ""This is one that seems to have emerged out of nowhere, really, and it's escalated to a degree where it should be concerning everybody."" He added that the problem was UK-wide. Figures from Scotland showed a four-fold increase in deaths related to alprazolam from 24 in 2016 to 99 in 2017. In 2018, Public Health Wales reported that counterfeit Xanax was among the ""most commonly identified"" classes of psychoactive substances analysed by the Welsh Emerging Drugs and Identification of Novel Substances Project's (WEDINOS) drug testing service.  Peter Burkinshaw is the drug and alcohol lead for Public Health England. ""We've got no evidence that there is a very widespread epidemic of its use, but we're certainly clear that its use is increasing,"" he said.  ""And we can see it in various data sets, we can see it in police seizures data, we can see it in hospital admissions data and we can see it amongst young people coming into treatment centres for help."" In December, Public Health England released figures showing the number of young people being treated for addiction to benzodiazepine drugs like alprazolam.  The report showed that alprazolam had the biggest increase in young people seeking help for addiction. Dr Michael McKenna, a GP at Falls surgery in Belfast, said counterfeit Xanax has become a particular problem among his patients over the last six months.  He is mainly treating teenagers and people in their early 20s. ""We had a number of drug deaths over the Christmas period and I've heard Xanax being mentioned as one of the drugs that has been taken.  ""We'll know when the post-mortem findings come out.""",,,,

The pressures of looking after an elderly, ill or disabled relative have made almost half a million people quit their jobs in the UK in the past two years, says Carers UK. The report calls for more flexibility in the workplace for carers. The charity's head, Helen Walker, says that 15% of the working population is ""now working and caring"". The report estimates that almost five million people are trying to balance looking after relatives with working - up from about three million in 2011. An ageing population has pushed this increase - but the report says not enough employers are offering flexibility over working hours or taking leave. Carers UK is calling for employment rights to formally recognise the needs of carers, such as providing five to 10 days per year of paid leave. Such carers in work are typically aged over 45 and the report says that their caring responsibilities ""often go unnoticed"". Among those giving up their job is Terry, who has left his role as a duty hospital manager in London to move to Monmouth to look after his father. The 92-year-old was living alone after Terry's mother died and he had begun to ""struggle with everyday tasks"". For Terry, it has meant going from a well paid job to relying on a carer's allowance and accepting that he now ""doesn't have a penny spare"".   The report follows a warning from the Office for National Statistics of growing numbers of people who not only have to look after an elderly relative but are also caring for their children. There are 1.3 million of these mid-life ""sandwich carers"", says the ONS, with many feeling ignored and undervalued. More than a quarter of such carers are suffering from depression or stress, says the ONS. Carers UK says there is a ""real social and economic imperative"" for workplaces to be made ""carer friendly"". ""Better workplace support for people juggling paid work with caring for a loved one is becoming an increasingly important issue,"" said Ms Walker.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47114990,"Striving for a supercharged golf swing could play havoc with your back, according to US doctors. The modern ""X-factor"" swing favoured by many professionals may hit balls harder and further but it can also put extra strain on the spine, the Barrow Neurological Institute experts say.  They look at the example of Tiger Woods in their research, which is published in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine.  The 43-year-old player recently made a comeback after serious back issues. Swinging the golf club at measured speeds of 129mph at the April 2018 Master's Tournament, Tiger Woods appears to be back to physical fitness. And he has said that he now has a greater understanding of what he ""can and can't do"" this season. ""A lot of it has been training, trying to get stronger,"" he said. An X-factor golf swing tries to get maximum rotation of the player's shoulders relative to their hips at the top of the backswing. This big rotation creates wound-up potential energy - the X-factor - but Dr Corey Walker, Dr Juan Uribe and Dr Randall Porter, from Barrow, say it may come at a cost, twisting the lumbar spine.  The spinal surgeons have been studying how the golf swing of present-day professionals, including Tiger Woods, differs from those of golf veterans, such as Jack Nicklaus and Ben Hogan.  They say players' physiques and techniques have changed significantly over recent decades.  Modern players are more muscular and have more powerful downswings and this can put increased force on the spinal disc and facet joints, they believe.  And over time, it can result in a damaging process that the authors call ""repetitive traumatic discopathy"" (RTD). But it's not just the backswing that might injure the lower spine.  During an explosive downswing, lateral flexion can result in a 'crunch"" of the side of the spine, putting strain on the disc and facet joints on one side of the spine, they say. Dr Walker said: ""We believe Tiger Woods's experience with spinal disease highlights a real and under-recognised issue amongst modern era golfers.  ""Tiger was using the mechanics of the modern day swing and that places a tremendous amount of strain on the back. ""It's still a theory but we are starting to see the late stages of this in some of our patients.  ""We are seeing younger and younger elite level golfers with degeneration in their lower back."" He said any golfer, elite or not, who experienced pain should seek expert help. Woods had fusion surgery on his lower spine to get back to fitness. He also did a lot of physiotherapy and strengthening exercises in the gym. Consultant physiotherapist Nigel Tilley, who has worked on the PGA European Tour, the Ryder Cup and with Team GB, said the research should be treated with some caution.  ""If you scanned a lot of people in their 40s, you would see some disc degeneration,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean the necessarily have a back problem with it though. ""And Tiger has had a very long golfing career doing repetitive movements, so it's perhaps not that surprising that he has had back problems. ""But there's certainly been a change in swing style among players in the last 20 years. ""It's become much more powerful and it can put more force on the spine. "" He said it was important for golfers to control that speed to avoid injury.  ""Strengthening and conditioning exercises in the gym can help reduce injuries,"" he said. ""If you are training properly, there's no reason why you can't resist these forces and have no problems or injuries. ""And golf is a great sport. I wouldn't want anyone to be put off doing it. You can play it at a very high level for a very long time.""

Walter Magaya earlier pleaded guilty to contravening the Medicines Control Act by selling an unapproved drug. Police arrested him in November, and seized a herbal drug which he said could cure people who had HIV and Aids.  Zimbabwe has the sixth highest HIV prevalence rate in sub-Saharan Africa.  About 1.3 million people were living with HIV, according to UN data compiled in 2016. The 35-year-old Magaya is among a group of young, brash and flashy religious figures who have emerged during Zimbabwe's economic crisis, attracting a huge number of followers with promises of miracle healing and miracle money, says the BBC's Shingai Nyoka in the capital, Harare.  He told his congregation in October that the drug, named aguma, had magical powers to destroy the Aids virus within 14 days, the privately owned New Zimbabwe reported at the time. ""The herb is 100% organic. Why I say so is because we found out that there are no side effects,"" he was quoted as saying.

The common perception in Cambodia is that acid attacks are a result of ""love triangle"" relationships, and female victims are often deemed in some way responsible for their attack.  Sun Sokney, one of the victims interviewed in the report, was attacked by her husband in a busy market. Thinking she was his mistress, the crowd cheered her husband as he ran away, only coming to her aid when Sun Sokney convinced them she was actually his wife.  In 1999, aged 16, Tat Marina was doused in acid. She says she was having an affair with a government official, whose wife found out and hired attackers to beat her unconscious before dousing her with nitric acid. The alleged organiser of the attack was never held accountable and investigations were dropped. Since that high-profile attack, acid attacks have occurred in waves as ""copycat"" cases take hold.  Since legislation was introduced in 2012 to tackle the crime, attacks have fallen in number, although the report says many are unreported and acid is readily available to buy.  Funding for the Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity, which offered provisions for survivors, has since been cut completely and HRW argues the government is not filling the gap.  One of the victims interviewed in the report said living as an acid victim was ""what hell feels like"".  ""Acid violence is rarely directly fatal. Rather, victims live on in physical, emotional, economic, and social suffering,"" the HRW report says.  Doctors interviewed were not aware that acid attack survivors, who suffer devastating injuries, should be treated free of charge. Every victim spoken to in the report needed to show proof that they could pay for medical care before receiving treatment.   It also said victims were unlikely to get justice as perpetrators were rarely caught or imprisoned.",,,,

In a new bill, proposed by Democrat Richard Creagan, the smoking age would increase rapidly between 2020 and 2024. It will need to pass through the state legislature and weather a potentially strong backlash from tobacco companies in order to become state law. E-cigarettes, chewing tobacco and cigars are not included in the bill. Dr Creagan, who was an emergency room physician before he was elected as state representative in 2014, calls the cigarette ""the deadliest artefact in human history"" in the bill. In January 2017, Hawaii became the first US state to raise its smoking age to 21. In other US states the legal age is usually 18 or 19. The new bill, HB 1509, suggests that the smoking age should go up to 30 in 2020, 40 in 2021, 50 in 2022, and 60 in 2023 - until finally, in 2024, people would need to be 100 years old to buy cigarettes. He told the Hawaii Tribune-Herald that a ""ridiculously bad industry"" had designed the cigarette to be ""highly addictive, knowing that it is highly lethal"". ""We don't allow people free access to opioids, for instance, or any prescription drugs,"" he said. E-cigarettes and cigars are left out of the bill because Dr Creagan believes they are significantly safer for smokers than regular cigarettes - although the National Cancer Institute warns that ""all tobacco products are harmful and cause cancer"". ""Regular cigar smokers and cigarette smokers have similar levels of risk for oral cavity and oesophageal cancers,""  it adds on its website.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US say that cigarette smoking is the top cause of preventable disease and death in the country.

Nathan Sutherland, 36, is accused of sexual assault and abuse of a vulnerable adult.  The 29-year-old victim has been a patient at Hacienda HealthCare facility in Arizona for about two decades. She gave birth to a baby boy in December.  Mr Sutherland was arrested after his DNA matched a sample from the newborn. Dave Gregan, Mr Sutherland's lawyer, told reporters outside the court that his client ""is entitled to due process of the law"". He added that Mr Sutherland will fight the charges, and plans to commission an independent DNA test. The accused was fired from the Phoenix clinic - where he had worked since 2012 as a nurse - after his arrest. Police tested the DNA of all male staff members after the shocking news of a baby born in the facility was revealed. Workers at the long-term care clinic, where the woman had been living since a young age, had been unaware that she was pregnant until she started giving birth, at which point they called the emergency services. Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams said there could be more victims at the clinic, but that finding them may prove impossible since many patients there are unable to communicate due to their medical conditions. Initially described as comatose by police, the woman's family later said in a statement that she is able to respond to sound and has some ability to move her body. ""The important thing is that she is a beloved daughter, albeit with significant intellectual disabilities,"" the family said in a letter last month. During the hearing at the Maricopa County Superior Court, Mr Sutherland spoke only briefly to confirm his name and date of birth. His next court hearing has been scheduled for 19 March.

1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47136678,"An exploding vaporiser pen resulted in the death of a 24-year-old Texas man, a post-mortem examination has ruled. The pen's battery blew up when William Brown tried to use it, sending shards of metal into his face and neck and severing an artery. He died two days later in hospital of a stroke, in what is at least the second such death in the US. Malfunctioning e-cigarette batteries have caused hundreds to thousands of similar injuries, US reports say. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office found on Tuesday that shrapnel from the vape pen's exploding battery impacted Mr Brown's skull, severed his carotid artery and ultimately caused his death on 29 January. The incident took place in the parking lot of a vape shop in Fort Worth, Texas on 27 January. Mr Brown had visited the shop to seek help using a Mechanical Mod style pen - a model known to have issues, a local CBS News affiliate reported.  He attempted to use the pen in the car when the battery exploded with enough force to melt plastic in the vehicle and fling metal debris into Mr Brown's face. The owners of the shop called an ambulance after seeing Mr Brown bleeding in the parking lot. ""When they x-rayed him, they found the stem, the metal embedded to where the blood flows up to the brain,"" Mr Brown's grandmother, Alice Brown,  told WFAA News. Doctors were apparently unable to remove the metal surgically. Mr Brown was placed in an induced coma, but eventually passed away. Mrs Brown, who raised Mr Brown, told the Star Telegram her grandson was just weeks away from his 25th birthday.  ""It just hurts so bad. Now he'll never see that birthday. It's a waste of the things he could have accomplished."" The 24-year-old was a licensed electrician and not a regular smoker - he had been testing out the pen for the first time, his grandmother said. She hopes his death gives others pause before trying an e-cigarette. ""If anything, I hope it stops someone,"" she said. ""I don't know how many more people will have to die."" Last May, a 38-year-old Florida man was also killed by an exploding vape pen. Tallmadge D'Elia was burned on 80% of his body and died when metal pieces entered his skull. A US government report says there have been 195 documented cases of exploding e-cigarettes between 2009 and 2016. The National Fire Data Center found 29% of exploding vape pen incidents from January 2009 to December 2016 had caused severe injuries. Another report from the University of North Texas Health Science Center looked at US emergency room data from 2015 to 2017 and found 2,035 e-cigarette related explosion and burn injuries - far more than previous reports. The researchers said regulation and surveillance of e-cigarette devices ""is urgently needed"".",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47074333,"""It's not veggie again is it? Can't we have some normal food, please, like lasagne?""  This was the reaction of my 13-year-old daughter, Louisa, said with a teenager's sigh, when presented with beany enchiladas, a healthy vegetarian recipe from BBC Food.  To be fair to her, beans have featured heavily in recent family suppers.  We're following the new planetary health diet, or Eat-Lancet diet, devised by 37 scientists around the world to improve our health and save the planet at the same time.  The diet is largely plant-based, although it does allow one serving of red meat, one serving of chicken and two servings of fish per week. Most protein, however, comes from pulses and nuts. Dairy is restricted to a glass of milk a day. Eggs are limited to one-and-a-bit a week. Bread, pasta and rice should be brown, and half our plates should be fruit and veg. Added sugar should be limited.  It doesn't sound extreme, but for most of us our average meat and dairy intake is far higher. In fact, Europeans would need to eat 77% less red meat and 15 times more nuts and seeds to meet the guidelines.   Our family is not totally typical because my husband, Johnny, is vegetarian, and his veggie stew is a weekly staple. Which is not to say that the kids are fans of said stew. They prefer to eat white pasta and sauce, sausages and chips, burgers and fish fingers.  At school their diet is even worse. School dinners are derided as ""gross"", so their average day consists of bacon butties, crisps and mid-morning ""pizza"" baguettes. After school, snacks might be a white flour English muffin, a bun, toast and jam, or a cake.  Plus illicit sweets on the way home.  As for me? I eat a lot of vegetables, but I also partake of meat too often, and, as a cheese, yoghurt and latte lover, my dairy consumption is far higher than the recommended range. Clearly there's plenty of room for improvement.  My first mission is to see if I can improve what the girls eat after school. At my local shop I look for healthy snacks. I settle on lightly salted popcorn, brown rice crackers, hummus, seaweed thins, nuts and olives.  I set these out in bowls around the kitchen, ready for the kids' return.  ""Great! Popcorn!"" says Josie, 11, as she charges into the kitchen. This snack is a winner as it reminds her of treats at the cinema. She ignores the nuts, doesn't love the seaweed, but eats the entire bowl of olives and a couple of rice crackers.   So far, so good.  For supper I'm making mushroom mince chilli, a recipe from The Food Medic website, which involves processing mushrooms to replace the mince. If you scrunch up your eyes the finished version almost looks like mince. It tastes good too. Everyone eats it a little reluctantly. Afterwards Louisa says: ""Can I get a burger at the weekend?""  The next morning, however, she makes her porridge with oat milk, without even being asked. And at school she opts for dried fruit instead of crisps.  Clearly some elements of the healthy-eating message are sinking in.  That evening I make tofu steaks with ginger and sesame from a recipe by popular Irish veggie chefs The Happy Pear. I'm not a huge tofu fan, but this recipe is delicious, and quick to make.  What do the kids think?  ""It's like flavourless bacon,"" is Louisa's verdict.  ""I'll eat what I like at school,"" says Josie.  Still, their plates are clear, so I'll take that as a win.  As the family's bean consumption rises, I'm cutting back on dairy.  I now have coffee with oat milk, a tasty and sustainable substitute. I'm staying away from yoghurt and cheese most of the time, and I feel lighter and brighter, although this could also be a result of my new veg-heavy diet, and less cake.  With the health of the planet in mind I'm also shopping more locally, cooking from my weekly organic veg box, and making sure to buy British meat and fish, where possible.  Our family is a long way from being dedicated followers of the planetary health diet, but focusing on the plan has helped us make some useful healthy changes: we're eating more fruit and veg and we've cut back on red meat, dairy and sugar.  The kids are only sometimes shouting ""gross"" at the sight of veggie stew.  My husband Johnny, already a veggie, broadly welcomed the diet: ""It wasn't a big hardship for me. But it was interesting that even a veggie might have to give something up under this diet - I'm thinking of the one-egg-and-a-bit-a-week rule. That felt a bit hair shirt."" Giving her verdict on the diet, Josie described it as: ""Interesting and disgusting. It's bad for a child as they don't get to eat fatty but nice things every day. But I did like healthier snacks like not sweet popcorn and raisins, and those beany enchiladas were nice. Wholewheat spaghetti is OK."" For my part, I've learnt that life can be lived with less cheese. I'm determined to continue with the regular veggie suppers, and to keep searching out family friendly recipes.  On the final day of the diet I offer the kids a choice of organic steak or aubergine curry.  It's no surprise when they choose the steak and enthusiastically wolf it down.  That's their red meat portion for the week then.  What did they have for lunch at school?  ""The diet's finished right? Sausage and chips,"" comes the reply.  Pictures by Phil Coomes.

The charity surveyed 2,361 people and found that only 1% were able to name the seven known risk or protective factors for dementia. The six risk factors are heavy drinking, genetics, smoking, high blood pressure, depression and diabetes.  Physical exercise is a protective factor against the disease.  The study, entitled Dementia Attitudes Monitor, found that more than half of UK adults now know someone with dementia.  But only half recognised that dementia is a cause of death, and they found that a fifth incorrectly believe it is an inevitable part of getting older.  Although a third of cases of dementia are thought to be influenced by factors within our control, only 34% of people surveyed believe it is possible to reduce the risk of dementia, compared with 77% for heart disease and 81% for diabetes.  Hilary Evans, chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK, said that despite growing dementia awareness, there was still a lot of misinformation.  ""It is a sad truth that more people are affected by dementia than ever before and half of us now know someone with the condition,"" she said. ""Yet despite growing dementia awareness, we must work harder to improve understanding of the diseases that cause it."" Source: Alzheimer's Research UK Sue Strachan is 63 and lives in Herefordshire.

Abdul Khaleq and Abdul Rahim, who are two weeks old, will not survive if they stay in Yemen, where the health system has been ravaged by years of civil war. The twins are currently at a hospital in the capital Sanaa, which is in the hands of rebel Houthi movement. Its airport is blockaded by a Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen's government. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. At least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the war, according to the United Nations. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also pushed Yemen to the brink of famine and left 16 million people without basic healthcare. Abdul Khaleq and Abdul Rahim have separate heads, spines, lungs, hearts and digestive systems, but share a liver, as well as two kidneys, two legs and two arms.  The boys need help to breathe are being treated in an incubator at Sanaa's al-Thawra hospital.

1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47153817,"Authorities in the Philippines have declared an outbreak of the highly contagious measles virus in several areas including the capital, Manila. As of 26 January there have been 1,813 measles cases and 26 deaths, according to the Department of Health Epidemiology Bureau. That is a 74% increase from 2018. Measles can be very dangerous for small children and babies. There is now increasing concern for the 2.4 million unvaccinated children. Parents have been reluctant to have their children immunised at government health centres, after complications related to a dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia. Dr Gundo Weiler, World Health Organisation (WHO) representative to the Philippines, said immunisation rates were well below the target of 95% and decreasing. In 2016 the rate was about 75%, but fell to 60% in 2017 and has likely fallen further in 2018. ""In this scenario we have a pool of children building up over time who are not protected and who are susceptible to measles,"" Dr Weiler said. Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease which spreads easily through coughs and sneezes. Initial symptoms usually include a fever, cough, runny nose and inflamed eyes. A red rash appears on the face and body a few days later. Health Secretary Francisco Duque told local media that bronchopneumonia from measles complications can be deadly, and encouraged parents to bring their children for immunisation. ""Parents should not wait for complications to set in because it might be too late,"" he said. ""We are declaring an outbreak as cases have increased in the past weeks and to strengthen surveillance of new cases and alert mothers and caregivers to be more vigilant,"" Mr Duque said in a statement.

1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46949102,"An estimated 4.2 million people in the UK said they were planning to abstain from drinking in January - and the official Dry January campaign says it's designed to ""reset"" people's relationship with alcohol.  So does a month off drinking help people form new habits, or is it likely to lead to a February binge? The idea that having a ""dry"" month leads to heavier drinking afterwards seems to be backed up by some studies - mainly on rats.  In one study, rats were given alcohol for a period of time before having it suddenly removed. When they were then given alcohol again, the rats drank more.  Researchers weren't able to find the same effect in humans, though, when they studied US army recruits who were forced to abstain from alcohol during their initial training.  Once the recruits were able to drink again, they drank the same amount or less on average - although the heaviest drinkers at the start were the most likely to drink more after abstaining. Both of those examples look at what might happen when you force someone to give up alcohol. But what about voluntary periods of abstinence? Is there a psychological effect involved in having chosen to do something?  In 2014, researchers at the University of Sussex teamed up with the charity Alcohol Change UK (which runs the official Dry January campaign) to measure its success, and they've produced an evaluation of the campaign each year since. When the first study was published, the then director of the charity who launched the campaign, Emily Robinson said: ""The long term effects of Dry January have previously been questioned, with people asking if a month booze-free would cause people to binge-drink once February comes around."" But, she said, no such effect had been found. This was also the finding of the team's latest report - 800 people surveyed who ditched booze in January 2018 were, on average, still drinking less in August than they were before they started the challenge, based on units consumed and days of drinking. Lead researcher Dr Richard de Visser said half of people surveyed drank the same amount afterwards, 40% drank less and the remaining 10% drank more than before. Those who drank more were generally the people who didn't make it to the end of the month.  Dr de Visser found a range of other health benefits, including weight loss and improved sleep. The problem is this study is self-selecting which means the results aren't necessarily representative of the whole population. It also had a very high drop-out rate - 2,800 people signed up to the study but by the August follow-up only 800 people remained.  The researchers tried to adjust for that by looking at who was ""missing"" from the final sample - more men than women dropped out, as did more of the heavier drinkers.   But while you can adjust for gender and drinking habits, it's harder to adjust for less tangible things like how generally motivated and committed someone is. In this instance, the researchers might well have been drawing conclusions about how Dry January affects people's drinking by looking at a group of especially dedicated people - who might not reflect how the general population responds at all.  The University of Sussex is planning future research where a representative sample of the general population will be studied.  To get an idea of what's going on in the general population, we could look at alcohol sales through the year - not a perfect measure as we don't know for sure that the booze is being drunk in the same month it was purchased.  Tax figures from HM Revenue and Customs show a big spike in sales in December followed by a big fall in January. Sales continue to fall in February, before creeping back up again to pre-December levels by March. Sales during the rest of the year are relatively consistent. There's little dispute over the health benefits of reducing alcohol intake (although people who are alcohol-dependent should seek professional help before withdrawing). But as for whether attempting a booze-free month helps reduce people's alcohol intake overall, the evidence is still patchy. The heaviest drinkers are the least likely to make it through the month and those who don't make it all the way through are more likely to then drink more. But for the heaviest drinkers who do make it through, and do end up drinking less, perhaps unsurprisingly they also get most benefits.  They reduce their drinking to a greater degree and see more marked health benefits.  The University of Sussex researchers who evaluated the study caution that this challenge is not suitable for people with alcohol dependence issues. Maddy Lawson at Alcohol Change UK said: ""A month off alcohol is safe for the vast majority of people, including most heavy drinkers. But if you drink very heavily or regularly you may be physically alcohol dependent, and in this case you are likely to need more support to cut down."" For those people not in that alcohol dependent category, but who are prone to binge drinking and ""binge abstaining"", some experts suggest they might be better off having a couple of dry days a week throughout the year instead.

Jessica Berg, 31, from Newport, said she feels ""trapped"" by the constant ringing sound in her ears. Her GP diagnosed her with tinnitus and said it was most likely as a result of exposure to loud music.  Action on Hearing Loss said the condition can make people feel ""isolated"" and ""helpless"". About one in 10 people in the UK suffers from tinnitus, which can cause stress, sleep difficulties, anxiety and hearing loss.  The condition is often linked with Meniere's disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and depression, but it is not known how it develops and there is no cure. Now Ms Berg was diagnosed three years ago and says she concentrates on trying to control the depression and anxiety it can cause.  ""They can't really tell [what causes it] because it's not a physical thing they can see in the ear, it's something they have to guess,"" she said. ""My very obvious answer for myself is live music. I used to go out a lot and see live bands. I never thought I should be wearing ear protection, I'd go and stand next to a speaker and never have a care in the world about it.

""It makes you feel quite trapped at times because you just want to turn it off."" Action on Hearing Loss suggests these techniques may be useful if you are struggling with tinnitus:",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47150658,"Mobile phones should be banned from the dinner table and bedtimes as part of a healthy approach to devices, the UK's four chief medical officers have said. Children should also take a break from screen-based activities every two hours, the government advisers said. And they added industry must do more to keep children safe. Their guidance comes as English Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, is set to meet bosses at Instagram over the handling of self-harm and suicide content. Links have been made between the suicide of teenager Molly Russell and her exposure to harmful material on Instagram. Her father has said he believes the Facebook-owned platform ""helped kill my daughter"". Prof Dame Sally Davies, England's chief medical officer and the lead for the UK, said the case was ""tragic"" and it was clear some children were being exposed to inappropriate content. She told the BBC companies had a duty of care to help keep children safe and that age limits for using social media needed to be properly enforced and children should not be channelled towards harmful content - one of the key concerns in the Molly Russell case. But Dame Sally said a review of evidence had not proven a clear link between screen-based activities and mental health problems. And digital technologies could be a force for good, aiding online learning, socialising and helping people manage health conditions. There are several clear steps for parents, which the chief medical officers say will help keep children safe and healthy. These include: Dame Sally said a code of conduct was definitely needed.  She wants to see technology companies invest in systems that properly vet the ages of users - a number of platforms require users to be 13 but these were not properly policed, she said. The guidance is also critical of what it calls ""persuasive design"".  This refers to techniques used to encourage addictive behaviour, including collecting likes and rewards for performing actions such as sharing pictures. Dame Sally also wants social media companies to develop better algorithms that push positive content to users. This has already been done for users who search for content that could potentially radicalise them. Instead of being fed material that promotes terrorism, users get content that aims to de-radicalise. Dame Sally said the same thing could happen when people searched for ""self-harm"" or ""suicide"". ""We would like to see content that promotes help-lines and where to go for support,"" she said. And she warned if industry did not act, ministers were likely to legislate to compel them. ""They need to sort themselves out - to safeguard our children,"" Dame Sally said. ""They have a duty of care - and if they don't, I expect the government will tell them how they will sort it."" Facebook welcomed the guidance and said it wanted young people to be safe online. It said it had introduced a new tool to help people see how much time they were spending on Facebook and Instagram, with daily reminders and a way to limit notifications. Twitter said it had introduced 70 changes in 2018 ""to make the service healthier and safer"". The chief medical officer used a team of academics to scour the research done on this issue.  The academics said that, while some research had pointed to an association between screen-based activities and negative effects such as an increased risk of anxiety and depression, it was still inconclusive. It could be just that people who struggled with mental health problems were more likely to turn to their devices, Dame Sally said, rather than their habits being the root cause of the problems. Nonetheless, Dame Sally said, there needed to be a precautionary approach to this - until more research had been done - hence the guidance to parents. Dr Bernadka Dubicka, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the medical officers were right to be cautious. ""We do not yet have enough evidence to draw a definite link between screen time and mental health problems - but it is clear that some of the content that young people are viewing online, such as pro-anorexia, suicide and self-harming content, can be incredibly harmful,"" she said. The chief medical officers' guidance comes after leading paediatricians said last month that parents should worry less about screen use after a review found there was little evidence it was harmful in itself.",,,,

While vaccination rates are improving, the WHO says coverage is not high enough to prevent circulation of the virus in many countries. Ukraine reported the highest number of measles cases last year - more than 10 times that of the next highest, Serbia. Over 90% of cases were in 10 countries, including France, Italy and Greece. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs and brain. There were 72 deaths from measles in Europe in 2018 compared with 42 in 2017. The European countries with the highest number of measles cases from January to December 2018 were: In the UK, there were 953 measles cases last year. Meanwhile, Ukraine had the highest rate of measles cases in Europe, at 1,209 per one million population - 10 times the country's rate in 2017. And this largely explains the sharp rise in total cases in Europe, from 25,863 in 2017 to more than 82,000 in 2018. Vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella in Ukraine fell sharply over a number of years during its conflict with Russia, reaching 31% in 2016 - among the lowest in the world. By the end of 2017, the percentage of children in Ukraine who had been vaccinated had significantly improved, to about 90% but, the WHO says, this now needs to be sustained to protect the population from further outbreaks of measles. Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe, said: ""The picture for 2018 makes it clear that the current pace of progress in raising immunisation rates will be insufficient to stop measles circulation.  ""While data indicate exceptionally high immunisation coverage at regional level, they also reflect a record number affected and killed by the disease.  ""This means that gaps at local level still offer an open door to the virus."" The WHO says the 2018 surge in measles cases followed a year when European countries achieved their highest ever estimated coverage for the second dose of the measles vaccination - 90%. The percentage of children receiving the first dose of the vaccine also increased, to 95%.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47157017,"Scientists say they may have found a way to reduce the appetite of blood-hungry mosquitoes, by giving them human diet drugs. This left them feeling full and bloated and put them off biting, US researchers said. They said the technique could be used to prevent illnesses such as Zika, yellow fever and malaria. But their research is still in its early stages, the study in the journal Cell reports. The researchers, from Rockefeller University in New York City, conducted their experiments on Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.  Female mosquitoes of this species - who are the only ones who bite - are fiercely attracted to human beings, because their blood contains the protein they need to produce their eggs. Once fed, that attraction to humans goes away, leaving them with little interest in another blood meal for several days. When the researchers gave the mosquitoes a saline solution containing the diet drugs, they were amazed to find that the mosquitoes' appetite plummeted, just as it does in humans. To measure this, they dangled a bit of nylon stocking full of body odour belonging to study author Laura Duvall, a postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University, in front of them. They then tested all of the mosquitoes' neuropeptide receptors with the drugs and discovered which particular one was responsible for controlling and switching off a mosquito's appetite. This knowledge can now help them find out where it is produced in the insect's body and how it is activated to control feeding behaviour. The researchers also identified a different compound, rather than a human diet drug - which would not be suitable for use in the wild - which could turn the insect's appetite on and off.  The research team says its findings have huge implications for future research. ""We're starting to run out of ideas for ways to deal with insects that spread diseases, and this is a completely new way to think about insect control,"" says senior author Leslie Vosshall, head of the laboratory of neurogenetics and behaviour at Rockefeller University.  ""Insecticides are failing because of resistance, we haven't come up with a way to make better repellents, and we don't yet have vaccines that work well enough against most mosquito-borne diseases to be useful."" Ms Duvall said focusing on mosquitoes' appetites was a good idea because it used what came naturally to them, but it was not an attempt to eradicate the insects because the effects of drugs were not permanent. She envisaged the drugs being delivered to female mosquitoes in the wild using traps attractive to the insects. ""We are multiple steps away from using this in the field, and we will always need other complementary strategies alongside this,"" she said. ",,,,

Jackline Ngonyani said any MPs found not to have been circumcised should be required to undergo the procedure. Her suggestion divided opinion among her colleagues. HIV is seen as a major threat to public health in Tanzania. Around 70% of the male population is circumcised. Around 5% of Tanzania's adult population is believed to have been infected by HIV - giving it the 13th highest rate of infection in the world, according to figures from 2016. The World Health Organization (WHO) says circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexual men contracting HIV by around 60%. Several African countries that are fighting HIV epidemics have launched campaigns to encourage men to undergo the procedure, which involves surgically removing the foreskin from the penis. Ms Ngonyani made the comments during a debate in parliament about how to curb the spread of HIV in the country. Her suggestion was backed by MP Joseph Selasini. In neighbouring Kenya, some top politicians voluntarily submitted to the procedure in 2008 as a way of encouraging men from their communities to do the same. However, MP Joseph Kasheku opposed Ms Ngonyani's proposal, describing it as uncouth and invasive.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47156077,"As the smartphone falls in price while its capabilities improve, it is becoming a valuable tool in the diagnosis of a growing number of diseases and ailments around the world. When Yonatan Adiri's mother fell down a bank and briefly lost consciousness when travelling in China, an initial diagnosis suggested she had a few broken ribs, but nothing more serious. Doctors were keen to fly her to Hong Kong for treatment.  But Yonatan's father was worried and took photos of the CT [computerised tomography] scans of the injuries, emailing them to his son. Yonatan showed the images to a trauma doctor, who instantly diagnosed a punctured lung. The flight to Hong Kong might have killed her. ""Who knows what would've happened if he hadn't taken photos?"" Yonatan wonders.  The experience inspired the Israeli entrepreneur - formerly Israel's chief technology officer under the late President Shimon Peres - to explore how the smartphone could be developed into a medical grade diagnostic tool. The result was Healthy.io, a start-up pioneering ""medical selfies"", as he calls them. The first product is a urine test kit that screens for signs of urinary tract infection, diabetes, and kidney disease. The standard urine test involves a special dipstick featuring 10 tiny pads that change colour if they detect various substances, such as blood, sugars or proteins, in the urine sample. Normally a trained clinician analyses the colour changes by eye, but Healthy.io's smartphone app can do it equally well using its computer vision algorithm. A smartphone chatbot called Emily takes people through the process step-by-step using voice, text and video.  The patient slots the dipstick into a colour-coded cardboard frame then scans the whole thing with the phone. The image is sent to the cloud for analysis and the results go to the patient's doctor.  ""It's not a wellness device, it's a medical device,"" says Mr Adiri, emphasising that the product has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and by European Union regulators. As the test can be done very easily at home, he believes it has the potential to save health systems ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" in clinician time and earlier diagnosis of diseases that would be far more expensive to treat later on. The app and kit, which costs £9.99, has been used more than 100,000 times around the world, the company says. Pharmacy chain Boots is currently trialling the service in the UK, and the National Health Service is using it to monitor kidney transplant and diabetes patients. The main advantage of a smartphone is that it has ""huge computational power, a high-resolution screen, excellent cameras and is, importantly, connected and available worldwide,"" says Dr Andrew Bastawrous, co-founder and chief executive of Peek Vision, a tech company pioneering simple eye tests for developing countries.  About 36 million people in the world are blind, many from easily treatable diseases, he says. Earlier diagnosis could save the sight of the majority of these people.  But in remote, poorer areas of the world, bulky and expensive medical equipment is hard to come by.  Peek Vision's eye test app, Peek Acuity, displays the letter E on the phone screen and this changes in size and orientation during the test.  The patient points in the direction he or she thinks the letter is pointing and the tester swipes the screen in that same direction. The app works out if the answer was right or wrong. The test results are stored in the cloud and sent to the nearest trained clinician. ""Our app is designed so that almost anybody can use it,"" says Dr Bastawrous, an academic and eye surgeon who works at the International Centre for Eye Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  ""Training takes just a few minutes, so it can be used by non-specialists, including teachers, community leaders and general health workers."" The phone's camera can also simulate what the world looks like to the person tested, helping parents clearly understand why their child might need treatment, he says. So far, more than 250,000 people have been screened in Kenya, Botswana and India, with the costs being picked up by partner charities and governments. The app has won clinical approval in Europe, and Dr Bastawrous says it is ""at least as accurate as a conventional eye test"".  ""The ability to record data at the point of care, take images that could be analysed using artificial intelligence or by experts who cannot be everywhere at once, increases the possibility of universal healthcare being realised across the spectrum of healthcare specialities,"" he concludes. There are plenty of other companies and researchers exploring the potential of the smartphone as a medical diagnostic tool, often in conjunction with add-on pieces of kit. Cellscope, for example, has developed an attachment for the smartphone camera that enables parents to probe a child's ear and take a video of the inside, which is then viewed by a doctor remotely. The idea is that parents can rule out false alarms and save on wasted trips to the doctor. Meanwhile, research teams are developing plug-in sensors that can detect a range of diseases, from HIV to Ebola, from a small sample of blood. And attachments can turn the phone's camera into a microscope capable of examining red blood cells for signs of malaria.  More Technology of Business ""There have been some exciting developments in the evolution of the smartphone as a diagnostic tool,"" says Niamh McKenna, health lead at consultancy Accenture. ""Clinical diagnosis on the move has great potential for application in remote areas. ""However, we need to remind ourselves that ultimately smartphones are being developed as consumer technology and not as medical devices,"" she adds. ""Trying to repurpose them in this way can lead to confusing consumer propositions and potentially come up against regulatory issues - like data protection."" But if cheap, portable and accurate diagnosis of treatable conditions saves lives as promised, the smartphone could become the most important invention of the last 20 years.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47159808,"More than 1,000 10 to 19-year-olds were admitted to hospital with knife wounds in 2017/18. The figure, from NHS England, reveal a 54% rise in the number of children and teenagers treated for injuries from knives over five years. It comes as a leading consultant warns that she is seeing increasing numbers of girls involved in knife crime.  Doctors also said that injuries were becoming more severe and victims getting younger. The figures record the number of people admitted to hospital for an overnight stay or longer, for knife crime injuries between 2012-13 and 2017-18. Among victims aged between 10 and 19, the numbers went up from 656 to 1,012 last year. Admissions have also grown by 30% across all ages, from 3,849 in 2012-13, to 4,986 last year.  Doctors said the numbers could be even higher, as victims who received treatment in A&E for minor knife crime injuries were not recorded.  Dr Martin Griffiths, consultant trauma surgeon at The Royal London Hospital, said: ""We are seeing a lot more adolescents and young people with severe injuries. That used to be an occasional occurrence, now it is the norm.  ""This week I expect to see someone of school age as a matter of course. ""I see the wasted opportunities of young people stuck on hospital wards with life-changing injuries."" Dr Gayle Hann, the lead for paediatric A&E at North Middlesex Hospital, pointed to the rising numbers of girls becoming involved.  ""It used to be that we rarely saw girls and young women, but now we are seeing increasing numbers as both victims and aggressors.  ""Young women are coming in who have had their mobile phones taken off them in an attack, then had their attack filmed as part of their humiliation.  ""They are then told that if they say anything their attackers will put the video on the internet.""  Dr Hann said knives are also getting bigger: ""I used to take kitchen knives off people, now we are seeing zombie knives.""  Patrick Green, chief executive of the Ben Kinsella Trust, a charity which campaigns against knife crime, said: ""This is a crisis. Many young people see no other alternative for them than to carry knives in their environment.  ""Youth workers in hospitals who are providing ongoing support to young people are making a big difference.  ""But we need to prevent them getting there in the first place, and educate them to make better choices.""   Dr Griffiths said the Royal London Hospital had done work with the charity St Giles Trust to reduce the numbers of young victims of knife attacks returning to hospital with further injuries.  ""We've dramatically reduced readmissions by giving our victims of injury a case worker who will meet them in the hospital, and give them a further six months of bespoke care in the community"" he said. ""The best results are obtained by consistent, nurturing bonds. ""Knife violence is endemic. We all have a responsibility to engage with supporting youth to address this.""  In January, Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced new knife crime prevention orders which can be issued by police to anyone aged 12 or over who is believed to be carrying a blade.   The Asbo-style orders would give police more power to impose curfews, send young people caught with knives to educational courses and - in some cases - restrict their social media use to prevent rival disputes escalating.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47133338,"Poor mental health among children and young people has been described as an epidemic and an ""escalating crisis"". The number of children seeking help from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) in England, has more than doubled over the past two years.  But establishing how much of this represents an actual rise in young people experiencing problems, and how much is down to better awareness of symptoms and diagnosis, is difficult.  Staying with England for now, our best shot is to look at a representative sample of the whole population, not just those who have come in contact with mental health services.  An NHS survey of young people in England, selected from GP records, did just this. It found a small but genuine rise in diagnosable emotional disorders like depression and anxiety, especially among girls.  This was based on full psychiatric assessments of roughly 10,000 young people - meaning it could pick up existing problems even if someone had never sought help.   Researchers found the proportion of under-16s experiencing any mental disorder had risen from 11.4% to 13.6% between 1999 and 2017.  That total includes things like anxiety and depression as well as behavioural disorders and hyperactivity.   ""It was smaller than we thought,"" says Prof Tamsin Ford, a child psychiatrist and researcher who developed the survey. ""It's not huge, not the epidemic you see reported.""  Older teenagers were included in the survey for the first time in 2017 and it suggested that young women aged 17-19 were two-thirds more likely than younger girls, and twice as likely as their male peers, to experience poor mental health. There is a big gap between the rise in the number of children found to have diagnosable mental disorders over almost two decades, and the rise in referrals to Camhs in just two years. And that suggests a good proportion of the rise is down to more people seeking help, not entirely to more people being unwell.  That doesn't mean all those people will get help, though. There has also been a rise in the number of young people saying themselves that they have a mental disorder, according to national surveys conducted each year around Britain. Self-reported conditions among young people increased six-fold in England, doubled in Scotland and went up by more than half in Wales between 1999 and 2014.  Again, that's despite the fact that researchers couldn't find an equivalent rise in the numbers showing signs of psychological distress when given a formal psychiatric assessment. This is likely to be because children - and their parents - are better able to recognise difficulties, leading to a ""narrowing of the gap between problems that exist and problems that are reported,"" according to Prof Ford's research. It's also possible some children are identifying distressing emotions as disorders even though they don't have a diagnosable condition. And methods of diagnosis of mental illness are not perfect either since they are trying to draw a clear line [between having a condition and not] in something that is anything but clear: where ordinary feelings of anxiety become an anxiety disorder, or where feeling low due to circumstances crosses over into clinical depression. It's not just that young people are more likely to say they have difficulties with their mental health, though. In England, there has also been an almost doubling of hospital admissions for self-harm among girls since 1997 (although there's been no corresponding rise among boys). An NHS Digital spokesman said the disparity between the sexes meant the rise was unlikely to be just down to improvements in recording. But even when it comes to symptoms this severe, hospital records aren't necessarily a perfect measure of more people harming themselves.  A better understanding by professionals has led to more cases being recorded as self-harm, Prof Ford says, whereas previously people may have been treated for their wounds without the self-inflicted nature being picked up. This may also be down to a reduction in stigma - most self-harm is concealed and so more people presenting at hospital doesn't necessarily mean more self-harm is actually taking place. A ""surprising number of people"" harm themselves quite severely yet never go to hospital, she explains.  Although the evidence for whether children and young people's mental health is getting worse is contradictory, according to Lorraine Khan at the Centre for Mental Health, there are ""some tentative signs of a decline in young women's wellbeing"", backed up by the latest NHS figures, which need investigation.

1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47193545,"Younger women with a family history of breast cancer should receive annual screenings to pick up the disease earlier, a charity says. Breast Cancer Now funded a study which found cancers were detected sooner when 35 to 39-year-olds at risk had annual mammograms. NHS screening often starts at the age of 40 for women with a family history. Experts need to balance the benefits of doing more checks against causing any undue worry or over-treatment.  The study's authors said that more analysis was needed on the risks, costs and benefits of extending the screening programme. But Baroness Delyth Morgan, the charity's chief executive, called for the government's forthcoming review of NHS screening programmes in England to consider the introduction of scans for women aged 35 to 39 with a family history of breast cancer. The study, carried out by researchers at the University of Manchester, offered scans to 2,899 women in this age group who were deemed to have a moderate or high risk of the disease after being referred by a GP to a family history clinic. The screening detected 35 invasive breast cancer tumours, most of which were small and identified before they had reached the lymph nodes - a sign that they had not spread around the body. In a control group, which did not have the screening, far fewer of the cancers were discovered when they were still small and more had spread to the lymphatic system. Prof Gareth Evans, the lead author of the study, said the trial demonstrates that annual scans are effective in detecting tumours earlier for this younger age group. He said overdiagnosis - where people are treated for cancers that are unlikely to prove harmful - was ""far less likely"" to be an issue with this younger age group. ""For women with a family history, removing a non-invasive tumour so early in their lives is likely to be a cancer preventive,"" Professor Evans said. The study did not include women who had specific gene mutations which can increase the risk of the disease. The charity says regular MRI scans - as is currently recommended - remains the best option for those with faulty BRCA or TP53 genes. If annual mammograms for at risk younger women were made widely available across all four of the UK's NHS services, it could affect up to 86,000 women, the researchers said. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with about 55,000 women being diagnosed each year and 11,500 dying from the disease. Between 5% and 15% of breast cancers are linked to a family history of the illness. ""We've long known that a family history can define a woman's risk, and that breast cancer can be more aggressive in younger women,"" said Baroness Morgan. ""So if we can intervene earlier for those at higher risk through annual screening, we believe we may be able to stop the disease cutting so many women's lives so heartbreakingly short."" An NHS England spokeswoman said possible changes to the screening programme will be considered in the review. She said: ""Breast cancer survival is at its highest ever and with improved screening a key focus of the NHS long-term plan, even more cancers will be diagnosed earlier."" The Scottish Government said it continues to monitor and consider all available evidence and recommendations.",,,,

Some also reported improvements in their mental health. ""I didn't realise I was starting to go through the menopause when it happened a few years ago,"" said Alison Owen, 49. ""I'd read several stories about women who were hitting the menopause and had become anxious or were diagnosed with depression. ""I didn't want anything like that, and I thought I've got to do something to keep myself active and get out there."" Alison left her teaching job last summer to care full time for her daughter who has cerebral palsy, but says that soon afterwards she started to get involved in cold water swimming. After initially trying sea swimming out for herself around the Gower Peninsula in Swansea, Alison was contacted by other women who were also keen to join in. ""The start of it is just a thrill and excitement. It releases an inner child I suppose, it reminds you what you used to be like before you had kids, before you had a job, before you had a mortgage,"" she said. She added that it takes ""around 91 seconds of absolute grit"" to stay in the water, before the body begins to adjust. Alison said that the response from women taking part in the swims has been so positive that they formed an impromptu group, The Gower Bluetits, an offshoot of a similar swimming club in Pembrokeshire. The result is that up to 20 women can be seen charging down the beach screaming before crashing into the sea. The menopause happens when a woman's period stops, and she becomes unable to conceive a child naturally, according to the NHS. Symptoms can include night sweats, hot flushes, low mood or anxiety and memory problems. A woman's sex life may also be affected, with decreased sex drive, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex. Menopause usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age, when a woman's oestrogen levels lower. ""I'm going through the menopause,"" said swimmer Patricia Woodhouse, 53. ""I feel that it's been easier since starting this. The sweats and the night sweats haven't been so bad. I also suffer with anxiety and I've found my anxiety levels don't feel as bad either. ""I still get anxious but it's nothing like it was before."" Patricia puts some of the positive effects she feels down to the triggering of the body's fight or flight mechanism. ""I think it just allows you to let go for 10 minutes, to think about nothing else,"" she said. According to Prof Mike Tipton, an expert in cold water swimming at the University of Portsmouth, the effects the group are reporting are not unusual in the cold water swimming community.  ""There is a significant amount of anecdotal evidence that suggests that it works for some things, but we don't know how,"" he said. ""There are plenty of theories surrounding the effects of cold water swimming but no definitive studies.  ""One of the main issues is that it can be very difficult to isolate the different factors involved. Most cold water swimming involves exercise and socialising - two things we know can have a positive impact on mental health."" Because of that, Prof Tipton said it can be extremely difficult to analyse what role, if any, the water's temperature can have. ""Everybody knows that when you go into a cold shower you get a gasping 'cold shock' response,"" he added. ""This releases the body's stress hormones, the fight or flight response - as a result people talk about feeling euphoric or high. ""But people need to remember they are engaging in a potentially dangerous activity, that same response can stop you being able to hold your breath in water."" Some members said part of the healing effects they feel are down to their voluntary vulnerability. ""It is a freedom,"" said Patricia. ""It's the same freedom that children have, they've got no inhibitions, nobody cares what they look like when they're that young, they just get in there. ""That's what we do too, we don't care what we look like, there's no competition, it's just about having fun.""",,,,

Pregnant women told Cardiff University researchers they felt ""irritated and alienated"" by people if they smoke or drank in public. According to the latest figures, 21% of women in Wales smoke at the date of their first pregnancy assessment.  Researchers said women need ""empathy"" rather than being stigmatised.  The study claimed women who smoke or drank during pregnancy said they had ""awkward"" relationships with their midwives and would receive health advice in a ""judgemental tone"", making them less likely to seek support.  Some women said they were also judged negatively by anti-smoking partners, although others were encouraged to drink alcohol at home as it was an enjoyed shared activity prior to pregnancy.

Dr Aimee Grant, from Cardiff University's Centre for Trials Research, said: ""Moral judgements are commonly directed towards mothers through reference to health behaviour in pregnancy, and working-class mothers are particularly subject to this criticism, ignoring the challenges of living on a low income.

But he says it not enough to say that 'you'll feel so rewarded after each shift' if you are paid so little.  ""For such an emotionally and sometimes physically demanding job it is shocking that the majority of care workers are paid minimum wage."" Naomi Baker is a 20-year-old university student who uses care workers. She says it is useful having someone closer to her age caring for her. ""It's easier for them to understand what I want."" The campaign will be asking people of all ages to come forward. But research shows that young people are the most likely to work in the sector. There is also an acknowledgement that the care sector needs to plan for the long term.  There are more than 1.4 million people working in social care - a figure that needs to rise by 650,000 by 2035 to cope with an ageing population. While care home work is synonymous with the sector, the campaign will highlight the variety of roles available, including hospital-based therapists, activity co-ordinators and personal assistants. Sharon Allen, of Skills for Care, which supports the training of care workers, said: ""I have spent my whole career in adult social care so I know first hand the tremendous professional and personal satisfaction that is on offer to anyone who joins us through this campaign.""",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47211262,"Having human papilloma virus (HPV) is not rude or shameful and is extremely common, experts say.  It comes as a survey of 2,000 women shows there are still stigmas around the infection, which can be passed on during sex and is linked to cancer.  Charities are concerned this could put women off getting smear tests. Despite four out of every five getting HPV in their lifetime, many would worry about what their partner might think of them if they were diagnosed with it. In the survey by Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, nearly half said they would be worried about telling their partners. Half would wonder who had given it to them and a similar number would worry it meant that their partner had been unfaithful.  Amanda Blood, 28, was diagnosed with cervical cancer after putting off having a smear test. Her doctors told her she also had HPV. ""At first I was really angry at my ex. I'd only ever slept with two people,"" she said. ""But when I read more about HPV, I understood that it is actually really common and you shouldn't hold anyone responsible for it."" There are more than 100 different types of HPV - the name given to a very common group of viruses. Some 'high-risk' types of HPV can cause changes to the cells in the cervix, which can lead to cervical cancer if not treated. These abnormal cells are what smear tests pick up. Genital HPV can be caught from skin-on-skin contact, meaning you don't have to have full sex to be at risk.  Oral sex and intimate touching can also pass on the infection, which lives on the skin. Claire Bolton was 38 when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. At the time, she had never heard of HPV.  ""I wasn't given any information about it,"" she said. ""Everything I found out was from what I read for myself on websites and forums and it was quite shocking to read about.  ""It's such a common infection yet there's still a stigma attached to it and you do start questioning things.  ""I was in a long-term relationship with a person that I didn't really trust at that time.  ""But you can have HPV for years and not know it. ""It is a really easy thing to get, so you shouldn't be embarrassed."" Most of the time, people will not realise that they have HPV because they will not have any symptoms or complications.  Your immune system usually gets rid of HPV without treatment. But some strains or types of HPV (there are lots of different ones) can cause genital warts. Others are linked to cancer.  In the survey, a third of women were unaware of the link to cervical cancer and most did not know that it could cause throat and mouth cancer. Girls are already offered a free vaccine to help protect against HPV. And the NHS is adding HPV testing to cervical cancer screening, meaning women will be checked for it when they have a smear.  If they have it, they can have other tests and treatment if they need it to hopefully avoid a cancer from growing. Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under, with some having no symptoms. Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, who will be talking about the survey findings at Cancer Research UK's Early Diagnosis conference, said: ""We must address the level of misunderstanding that exists around HPV.  ""Most people will get the virus in their lifetime, so it is worrying to see such high levels of fear or shame associated with it."" Sara Hiom, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""Busting the myths and removing the stigmas surrounding HPV is vital to ensure people feel more confident to book and turn up for their cervical screening appointment."" HPV doesn't just affect women. It can also cause a number of different types of cancer in men, such as cancer of the penis, anal cancer and some types of head and neck cancer. Tony Kimberley was diagnosed with penile cancer in March 2013.  He says he knew nothing about the virus when it was first mentioned to him and spoke to his wife and daughter to find out more.   ""Men need to be more aware about what's going on with their bodies and the effects of HPV,"" said Tony.  ""There are serious consequences to leaving HPV untreated and many people will not know they have it."" The government has agreed that boys aged 12-13 should be offered an HPV vaccine to protect them against cancer.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47215806,"Parents should not be complacent about the risks of teenagers using cannabis, experts are warning. UK and Canada researchers said they had found ""robust"" evidence showing using the drug in adolescence increased the risk of developing depression in adulthood by 37%. They said the findings should act as a warning to families who saw cannabis use as part of the growing-up process. The team added that the developing brain was particularly susceptible. The researchers - from University of Oxford and Montreal's McGill University - said cannabis use in the young was an ""important public health issue"", particularly given that cannabis available today tends to be much stronger than it was previously. Around one in nine young adults and teenagers use the drug each year in England and Wales. Report author Prof Andrea Cipriani conceded some parents had a relaxed attitude to the drug, but added the evidence was clear. ""This is important information for parents and teenagers. The risk is modest, but it can have a devastating impact."" This is the first time the actual risk has been quantified in this way. The team looked at 11 previous studies, covering more than 23,000 young people, the journal JAMA Psychiatry reported. Young people who had already shown signs of depression or had a family history of the condition were excluded. It found cannabis use before 18 increased the chance of an individual developing depression in young adulthood - defined as before the age of 35 - by 37%. In terms of numbers that means around one in 14 cases of depression in that age group - around 60,000 in the UK - could be attributed to drug use in the teenage years. The study also looked at whether there was an association with anxiety and suicide attempts.  There was an increased risk of anxiety developing in young adulthood, but it was not considered statistically significant. Meanwhile, those who used cannabis in their teenage years were three times more likely to try to kill themselves - although the data on that trend was not considered robust enough to draw a firm conclusion. No. The researchers were unable to prove cannabis use was definitively causing depression. Instead, they could only say it looked to be a strong link. This is because of the figures they found, but also what is known about the impact cannabis has on the developing brain. Evidence has suggested that the drug affects the parts of brain that govern rational and emotional thinking as well as serotonin levels that influence mood. To prove the link, trials would have to be conducted on young people - something that will never be done because it is unethical. King's College London psychiatrist Prof Sir Robin Murray said the research could not be considered conclusive, but acknowledged the findings were ""probably correct"". He said the risk of developing depression was smaller than what has already been established for schizophrenia-like psychosis. He also said it was likely that any risk would be also down to the amounts of cannabis consumed and the strength - something this study was unable to unpick.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47227477,"The toast pops. The butter's spread. Then you unscrew the lid and there it is - a circle of furry white-and-blue mould staring back at you from your strawberry jam jar. Not very tempting but, according to reports in the Daily Mail, it's not enough to put off Theresa May. The UK's prime minister has reportedly told senior ministers in a discussion about ways to reduce food waste that she scrapes off the mould and eats what's underneath. But is that a good idea? Well, the Food Standards Agency does not advise eating food that is obviously rotten or containing mould.  It says this is especially important for people in vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, pregnant women and those who have a weakened immune system. However, Michael Mosley feasted on jam and a range of other gone-off foods, under the guidance of mould expert Patrick Hickey, for a BBC documentary in 2014. Jam with a thin layer of mould can be salvaged, he says.  If you scoop off all the mould and a few centimetres beneath to throw out difficult-to-see spores, the jam should be safe to eat. And it's not just jam that is still edible despite a bit of mould, according to Michael Mosley's research. He says once you've cut off the mouldy part (being careful that the knife doesn't get contaminated by mould), cheddar and Parmesan are fine to eat.  As dry cheeses, they don't provide the moisture that mould needs to thrive and it doesn't normally penetrate below the surface. Some cheeses, of course, are deliberately infected with fungi. Penicillium roqueforti gives blue cheeses such as stilton and Roquefort their flavour. Soft cheeses are the really important ones to watch. The presence of mould suggests infection not just by unwelcome fungi but also harmful bacteria, such as listeria or salmonella. If that happens, throw it away. Delving in the bottom of the bag, you pull out a neglected piece of bread covered in small bits of white and blue mould. Cut those bits off, toast it and you'll be fine, says Patrick Hickey. But it involves really looking at the type of mould. ""The time you really need to be worried about bread is when it has black bits on it.""  If you see orange, yellow or black mould spots then throw the bread away, he advises. The FSA cautions people against eating mouldy bread. It says stale bread can be used safely in some recipes.  Fruit normally lasts better than vegetables because the acid in fruit keeps harmful bacteria at bay but do be wary of apples. They'll keep for ages but if there's a puncture in the skin, fungi can get in, says Patrick Hickey.  ""There have been serious outbreaks in the past, incidents of people being poisoned by drinking bad apple juice, which contains a toxin called patulin."" How about a soup made with those long-forgotten, slightly slimy courgettes and carrots lurking at the back of the fridge? Best not. That slime is caused by bacterial colonies growing on the surface. ""You'd probably develop terrible stomach ache in a couple of hours, followed by stomach cramps and diarrhoea,"" says Patrick Hickey. Mouldy nuts are particularly dangerous because they harbour a fungus called Aspergillus flavus. ""This fungus produces one of the most deadly toxins known to humankind,"" says Patrick Hickey.  ""The toxin accumulates in the liver and can cause liver cancer. If there's no mould on the shell and the internal part is sealed and protected, then we should be fine."" And the important bit: You can be flexible with ""best before"" or ""sell by"" dates but don't risk serious food poisoning by eating foods past their ""use by"" date, warns Patrick Hickey. Some species of mould can produce toxins that are known to have adverse effects in humans as well as in animals. While it is possible that removing the mould and a significant amount of the surrounding product could remove any unseen toxins that are present, there is no guarantee that doing so would remove them all.",,,,

These numbers flag up early signs of cardiovascular disease, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Forty health organisations have teamed up to urge more people to go for a routine NHS health check. Doctors should also identify and treat at-risk patients better, they say.   Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes one in four deaths in England, the equivalent of someone dying every four minutes, according to Public Health England and NHS England. Poor heart and artery health can also lead to heart failure, kidney disease, arterial disease and vascular dementia. So, health bodies are leading efforts to improve the detection and treatment of three conditions that contribute to CVD - atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure and high cholesterol - over the next 10 years. These conditions often have no symptoms, which is why health experts are recommending people aged over 40 take up a free NHS health check. These can be booked at GP surgeries. They are also available at some local pharmacies and shopping centres. PHE recommends checking your local area to find out where they are being offered. People over 30 are being urged to take the Heart Age Test. Keith Wilson, from Liverpool, had a heart attack out of the blue at 37. ""I had no symptoms and no reason to believe I was sick in any way,"" he says. His father had died of heart disease in his late 60s so he assumed it was something that happened to older people. ""I just didn't consider I was going to get it. I was complacent,"" he says. After a second heart attack, Keith spent the next three to four years in and out of hospital receiving treatment. He had to give up work and this really affected his family and young son. Now 60, Keith is mindful of his health and keeps a close eye on how much he drinks and exercises. He gave up smoking straight after his heart attacks. Cholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. It can build up in the artery walls, restricting blood flow to the heart, brain and rest of the body. It can be measured with a blood test. Total cholesterol levels should be: You are at high risk if you have a family history of heart disease, heart attacks or strokes, are overweight or have high blood pressure. Blood pressure is recorded using two numbers - the systolic pressure at which the heart pumps blood around your body and the diastolic pressure which measures resistance to blood flow in the blood vessels. Most cases of CVD are preventable and, alongside free health checks, PHE recommends people should: The report also calls on health professionals to improve the way they manage patients at risk of CVD. By 2029, PHE and NHS England want: These targets will help meet the commitment to prevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and cases of dementia, as set out in the government's long-term plan for the NHS. But there is no new funding for these new targets. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: ""We know our Pin numbers but not the numbers that save our lives.  ""Thousands of heart attacks and strokes can be prevented by more people knowing their blood pressure and cholesterol numbers and by seeking help early.""  Prof Stephen Powis, NHS medical director, said reducing health inequalities was also a priority, with people in the most deprived communities four times more likely to die prematurely from CVD than those in the most well off. England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Almost half of those with high blood pressure are going about their daily lives without it being detected or treated.  ""Millions of people are needlessly at risk of heart attacks or strokes when it could be prevented.  ""So, I want to help more people take the time out to protect their future health and get checked."" Five million people are estimated to have undiagnosed high blood pressure in England.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-47234787,"New results suggest ageing brains can potentially be rejuvenated, at least in mice, according to researchers. Very early-stage experiments indicate that drugs can be developed to stop or even reverse mental decline. The results were presented at the 2019 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The US and Canadian researchers took two new approaches to trying to prevent the loss of memory and cognitive decline that can come with old age. One team, from the University of California, Berkeley, showed MRI scans which indicated that mental decline may be caused by molecules leaking into the brain.  Blood vessels in the brain are different from those in other parts of the body. They protect the organ by allowing only nutrients, oxygen and some drugs to flow through into the brain, but block larger, potentially damaging molecules. This is known as the blood-brain barrier.  The scans revealed that this barrier becomes increasingly leaky as we get older.  For example, 30-40% of people in their 40s have some disruption to their blood-brain barrier, compared with 60% of 60-year-olds. The scans also showed that the brain was inflamed in the leaky areas. Prof Daniela Kaufer, who leads the Berkeley group, said that young mice altered to have leaky blood-brain barriers showed many signs of aging. She discovered a chemical that stops the damage to the barrier from causing inflammation to the brain. Prof Kaufer told BBC News that not only did the chemical stop the genetically altered young mice from showing signs of aging, it reversed the signs of aging in older mice. ""When you think of brain aging you think about the degeneration of cells and losing what we have,"" she said.  ""What these results show is that you are not losing anything. The cells are still there and they just needed to be 'unmasked' by reducing the inflammation."" In another study, Canadian researchers also said they could reverse cognitive decline in mice using an alternative approach.  They targeted a brain cell known to be a ""weak link"" in many brain disorders. The so-called somatostatin-positive neurons, which are involved in coding information, are the first to fail.  The signals from these cells are too weak to be received by surrounding neurons, which would relay the information to other parts of the brain.  Prof Etienne Sibille, from the University of Toronto, identified a chemical that essentially amplifies the signal. He presented results that showed that older mice who could not find their way around mazes were able to do this after they were given the chemical, just as well as younger mice not given the drug.  Prof Sibille said he was hoping to begin clinical trials on human patients in two years' time. ""If people have a cognitive deficit we would potentially be able to bring them back to higher functioning."" The big caveat is that the vast majority of treatments that show promise in mice don't work on humans. But both scientists believe that this time it might be different. Prof Sibille said he was heartened by the fact that the chemical repaired damaged neurons when it was given to mice. And Prof Kaufer said she believed that such work really could lead to a brain rejuvenation pill. ""People get jaded when they hear that things work on mice and then it is tried on humans,"" she said. ""But I think there is something different and exciting about this story in that it explains a new biology. ""It looks at brain function in a different way. It is about mechanisms that have been neglected and not thought about before.""",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47238523,"Eight out of 10 knee replacements and six out of 10 hip replacements last as long as 25 years, says a large study from the University of Bristol. This is much longer than believed, the researchers said, and the findings will help patients and surgeons decide when to carry out surgery. To date, there has been little data on the success of new hips and knees. But this Lancet research looked at 25 years' worth of operations, involving more than 500,000 people. Hip and knee replacements are two of the most common forms of surgery in the NHS, but doctors often struggle to answer questions from patients on how long the implants will last. Nearly 200,000 of the operations were performed in 2017 in England and Wales, with most carried out on people between 60 and 80 years old. Dr Jonathan Evans, orthopaedic registrar, lead study author and research fellow at Bristol Medical School, said: ""At best, the NHS has only been able to say how long replacements are designed to last, rather than referring to actual evidence from multiple patients' experiences of joint replacement surgery.  ""Given the improvement in technology and techniques in the last 25 years, we expect that hip or knee replacements put in today may last even longer."" As the ageing population grows, and life expectancy rises, this becomes even more important, Dr Evans added. Wendy Fryer, 80, had a hip replacement 17 years ago and it has completely changed her life. ""I was in agony beforehand, It was horrendous,"" she said. ""I used to cycle to work but had to stop. But the very next day after the operation, it was like magic, the pain had gone."" She still plays table tennis and badminton regularly, and also enjoys cycling and walking. ""The worst thing you can do is become a couch potato,"" Wendy says. Hip replacements: 89% lasted 15 years, 70% lasted 20 years, 58% lasted 25 years Total knee replacements: 93% lasted 15 years, 90% lasted 20 years, 82% lasted 25 years Partial knee replacements: 77% lasted 15 years, 72% lasted 20 years, 70% lasted 25 years The researchers, writing in the Lancet, looked at reports from joint replacement registries in six countries which held at least 15 years of data - Australia, Finland, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. They did not look at data from the UK, because its record of patients does not go back far enough, but the research team said their findings mirrored results from smaller studies of UK patients. According to the study, when hip and knee replacements do fail it tends to be because of infection, wear and tear and, more rarely, because they have broken. This means patients require revision surgery which is more likely to fail. John Skinner, from the British Orthopaedic Association and a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, said using more implants with better survival rates would mean fewer repeat surgeries in the future. ""This is great news. Orthopaedic surgeons are working to provide hip replacements that will last, as our population ages and lives longer."" He said it was known that 95% of hip replacements lasted at least 10 years. NHS advice says they last at least 15 years. ""Initially patients had joint replacements at the very end of their arthritic journey, just before they lost the ability to walk and became wheelchair dependent.  ""We are now so confident in hip replacement surgery that we can offer it to younger, more active patients, to relieve their pain and keep them active,"" Mr Skinner said.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47238070,"The brain function of very late risers and ""morning larks"" during the hours of the working day is different, according to a study. Researchers scanned the brains of night owls with a bedtime of 02:30 and a wake time of 10:15, along with early risers. The tests - performed between 08:00 and 20:00 - found night owls had less connectivity in brain regions linked to maintaining consciousness. They also had poorer attention, slower reactions and increased sleepiness. Researchers said it suggested that night owls were disadvantaged by the ""constraints"" of the typical working day.  They called for more research to understand the health implications of night owls performing on a work or school schedule to which they are not naturally suited. Scientists took 38 people who were either night owls or morning larks (people who went to bed just before 23:00 and woke at 06:30) and investigated their brain function at rest using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.  The volunteers then carried out a series of tasks at various times, from 08:00 to 20:00, and were asked to report on their levels of sleepiness. Morning larks were least sleepy and had their fastest reaction time in the early morning tests. They were also found to perform significantly better at this time than night owls.  In contrast, night owls were least sleepy and had their fastest reaction time at 20:00, although they did not do significantly better than the larks at this time. The brain connectivity in the regions that predicted better performance and lower sleepiness was significantly higher in larks at all time points, suggesting connectivity in late risers is impaired throughout the whole working day, researchers said. The lead researcher, Dr Elise Facer-Childs, of the University of Birmingham's Centre for Human Brain Health, said the findings ""could be partly driven by the fact that night owls tend to be compromised throughout their lives"".  Dr Facer-Childs said: ""Night owls during school have to get up earlier, then they go into work and they have to get up earlier, so they're constantly having to fight against their preferences and their innate rhythms."" She said there was a ""critical need"" to better understand how adapting to school and work times to which people are not suited, may be affecting health and productivity. About 40-50% of the population identify as having a preference for later bedtimes and for getting up after 08:20, researchers said. Dr Facer-Childs added: ""A typical day might last from 09:00 to 17:00, but for a night owl this could result in diminished performance during the morning, lower brain connectivity in regions linked to consciousness, and increased daytime sleepiness.  ""If, as a society, we could be more flexible about how we manage time, we could go a long way towards maximising productivity and minimising health risks."" Dr Facer-Childs stressed that the differences in brain connectivity are not a type of damage and are probably reversible.  There are also some limitations to the study. The tests did not look at brain function later in the day, and it is possible that other factors not picked up on in the study, like lifestyle choices, may have affected the results. Dr Alex Nesbitt, consultant neurologist at King's College London, who was not involved in the research, said the study added to evidence that a person's brain performance is influenced not only by the time of the day but also their body clock. ""It is becoming increasingly clear that these factors are important when 9-to-5 routines are widely imposed on people,"" he added.   The authors of the study called for more research to look at whether other brain regions might be affected by being a night owl or morning lark.  The research, which also involved the University of Surrey, is published in the journal Sleep.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47279072,"A new rapid test for earlier diagnosis of sepsis is being developed by University of Strathclyde researchers. The device, which has been tested in a laboratory, may be capable of producing results in two-and-a-half minutes, the Biosensors and Bioelectronics journal study suggests.  Diagnosing sepsis can be a complex process. The UK Sepsis Trust said it welcomed the research but added that no test was perfect at spotting the condition. It is estimated that 52,000 people in the UK die every year from sepsis, which is a serious complication of an infection.  There is a lot of research going on to attempt to find out what exactly triggers the sometimes fatal reaction involved in sepsis. The initial problem can be quite mild and start anywhere - from a cut on the finger to a chest or urine infection - but if left untreated can set off a cascade of reactions, from shock to organ failure and in some cases, death. Early diagnosis is key because for every hour that antibiotic treatment is delayed, the likelihood of death increases. Diagnosis of sepsis is usually based on clinical judgement, body temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, and a series of blood tests.  As soon as sepsis is suspected, broad-acting antibiotics should be given to the patient. A blood test that aims to determine the best antibiotic to treat the infection can take up to 72 hours.  The new test uses a device to detect if one of the protein biomarkers of sepsis, interleukin-6 (IL-6), is present in the blood. Dr Damion Corrigan, who helped develop the test, said IL-6 is one of the best markers of sepsis. ""The type of test we envisage could be at the bedside and involve doctors or nurses being able to monitor levels of sepsis biomarkers for themselves."" He said the test would work well in GP surgeries and in A&E to quickly rule sepsis in or out, if it was eventually approved through clinical trials. Dr Corrigan added that sepsis not only kills people but can also leave them with life-changing problems, such as limb loss, kidney failure and even post-traumatic stress disorder. The idea is that the device could be implanted and used on patients in intensive care.   Symptoms in adults:  Symptoms in children: With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, normally antibiotics, most people make a full recovery.  Source: UK Sepsis Trust The project's clinical adviser and co-author, Dr David Alcorn, from Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital, said the tiny electrode had the potential to detect sepsis and, at the same time, diagnose the type of infection and the recommended antibiotic.  ""The implications for this are massive, and the ability to give the right antibiotic at the right time to the right patient is extraordinary. ""I can definitely see this having a clear use in hospitals, not only in this country, but all round the world."" The researchers have applied for funding to develop a prototype device and hope to get commercial interest in taking it forward.  They hope the low-cost test could come into everyday use in three to five years. Ryan Sutherland, from Clackmannanshire, ended up in a coma with sepsis, which had been misdiagnosed.  He had felt unwell with a sore throat that got worse, but was told by a doctor it was a viral infection. ""As the week went on, it got worse and by the Thursday it was really bad. My wife took me to the out-of-hours doctor that night and by this point I was really unwell and could barely move. But I was given an anti-sickness injection and then I was sent home."" Hours later he collapsed. He was taken to hospital and suffered two cardiac arrests. His body went into shock with the sepsis and his organs started to shut down. After eight days in a coma, Ryan woke up and made an almost complete recovery. ""No-one mentioned sepsis, although looking back I had all the symptoms,"" said Ryan.  ""It's hard to diagnose, so if this test had been around it could have made all the difference to what happened with me."" The UK Sepsis Trust estimates that earlier diagnosis and treatment across the UK would save at least 14,000 lives a year. Dr Ron Daniels, the trust's chief executive officer, said: ""Any kind of test that enables us to identify sepsis earlier, before symptoms even present themselves, could help save even more lives and bring us closer to our goal of ending preventable deaths from sepsis. ""Systems like this are so important as, with every hour before the right antibiotics are administered, risk of death increases.  ""No test is perfect in the identification of sepsis, so it's crucial we continue to educate clinicians to think sepsis in order to prompt them to use such tests."" Update 19 February 2019: This article has been amended to more accurately reflect the stage of development that this new rapid test has reached and the continuing difficulties in diagnosing sepsis.",,,,

Death rates for asthma in 10 to 24-year-olds was highest in the UK among all 14 European nations included in an analysis of 19 high-income countries. The UK also had the highest obesity rates for 15 to 19-year-olds among the European nations. The government said it had ""world-leading plans"" to safeguard child health. Overall, the report found the UK to be lagging behind other nations across a number of health indicators. The study, from the Nuffield Trust think tank and and the Association for Young People's Health, analysed 17 measures of health and wellbeing for 10 to 24-year-olds in countries that included Germany, France and Italy, as well as Japan, the US and Australia. It found that while young people in the UK are making some healthier choices, such as drinking less alcohol and smoking less, more are entering adulthood with long-term health conditions.  Nearly one in five young people in the UK is estimated to be living with a longstanding health condition, such as type 2 diabetes, the report finds. In England, the figure has gone from 13.5% in 2008 to 18% in 2016.   The UK was also found to be one of the worst countries for young people to suffer from years lost to ill-health and the burden of their diseases, with only Australia, the US and New Zealand being worse.  Children and young people in the UK are also far more likely to be obese if they are poor, with the UK having some of the highest inequalities between the richest and poorest when it comes to the proportion that are obese, the study found. On poverty among older age groups, the report said: ""Despite living in the world's fifth largest economy, young people aged 20 to 24 in the UK are experiencing one of the highest rates of severe material deprivation among the countries in our international comparison. ""Reducing poverty among young people is key to improving their health outcomes in the UK."" Overall, the UK sits in the bottom third of countries in nine out of 17 indicators, and in the top third in three.  In four of the 17 measures, trends have been getting worse, while in five areas previous improvements have stalled.  Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, said the study suggested health services in the UK were ""getting something badly wrong"".  He said: ""I worry this reflects a dangerous complacency.   ""Young people in the UK are entering adulthood with more long-term health conditions and, as a result a poorer quality of life, storing up problems further down the line.  ""If we don't take action now, the next generation will be entering adulthood sicker than the one before it."" Asthma UK said it was ""appalling"" that people were more likely to die from asthma in the UK than in other European countries. The charity said its research has previously found that millennials - typically those born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s - get the worse asthma care of any age group.   Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and policy at Asthma UK, said: ""We are now urging the NHS to move with the times and put technology at the heart of asthma management, helping to engage this tech-savvy generation."" Emma Rigby, chief executive at the Association for Young People's Health, said there needed to be a greater understanding of young people's health needs. Researchers analysed data from the mid-1990s to the last year for which data was comparable with other countries, 2016. The 19 countries were: The UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Sweden, Japan, US, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""We have world-leading plans in place to safeguard child health by combating obesity, improving mental health and vaccinating against some of the world's deadliest diseases.  ""Prevention is at the heart of the NHS Long Term Plan, and as part of this we are increasing funding by an average 3.4% per year, meaning that by 2023-24 it will receive £20.5bn a year more than it currently does.""",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47359692,"England's only NHS youth gender clinic is too quick to give children and young people gender reassignment treatment, a former governor has said. Psychoanalyst Dr Marcus Evans, who resigned last week, told the BBC's Today programme he had been concerned about clinicians searching for ""quick solutions"". ""This is the opposite of what needs to be done,"" he said.  A director of the Tavistock Centre rejected his claims.  Dr Evans resigned from his post as one of the governors of the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust last week following an internal report that branded the Tavistock Centre ""not fit for purpose"".  On Monday, he told Today: ""Adolescence and childhood is a time when people are developing socially and biologically - a time when young people are identifying with different groups, and with male and female aspects of themselves.  ""There is pressure from the child who is in a distressed state, there is pressure from the family and the peer group and from the pro-trans lobbies - and all of this puts pressure on the clinician who may want to help the individual to resolve their distressed state by going along with a quick solution. ""There is a lot at stake here as these decisions have far reaching consequences.""  Dr Evans called for more external oversight of the Tavistock Clinic.  Over the past five years, the number of children referred to the Tavistock Centre has risen from 468 to 2,519 a year, a rise of more than 400%. And Dr Polly Carmichael, director of the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock, accepted the centre was under pressure. But she said: ""The service has really long assessments over periods of time, with the specific aim of allowing young people to think about what is right for them.  ""We've been under pressure for years from people that think we should go faster and now a more critical voice has emerged."" The centre now plans to use a recent research grant to study outcomes for all patients, whether they are prescribed medication or not.  The Department of Health says it has no plans to introduce an independent regulator.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47362792,"Families in England need more support in the early years to give children the best start in life, MPs say. The Health and Social Care Committee said the first 1,000 days were critical, but not enough was done. It warned cuts to children's centres, health visiting and services to support parents had left families vulnerable. Nearly a third of children are not ""school ready"" by the time they reach five, because they have not developed the necessary skills and behaviours. The cross-party group wants the government to pay for extra contact with health visitors beyond the age of two-and-a-half. The MPs pointed to the approach taken elsewhere in the UK - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all fund more than the minimum of five visits provided in England. Wales, in particular, was praised for its Flying Start programme which provides intensive support for the most disadvantaged families. But the MPs also said there needed to be better support to tackle problems such as substance misuse, mental health problems and domestic abuse among parents. Adverse experiences in childhood have been shown to increase the chances of poor health and development in later life. The report wants a cross-government strategy to be developed to herald an early years ""revolution"", including more support for families pre-birth. Councils, working with NHS and voluntary sector, could then be put in charge of implementing this strategy. But it also acknowledged ""massive investment"" was needed to boost services. Dr Paul Williams, who led the inquiry for the committee, said: ""Quite simply I want this country to be the most supportive and caring place in the world that a child could be born into."" Councillor Ian Hudspeth, of the Local Government Association, said councils have been undermined by cuts to their budgets. ""Councils have pulled out all the stops to try to prioritise early years and intervention services, but can only do so much."" A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said children's health was a ""key priority"", pointing out investment in mental health services for new mothers was already increasing. She said more plans for the early years would be set out soon in the government's forthcoming green paper on prevention.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47358333,"Few children's multivitamins give the recommended daily vitamin D dose, a study suggests.  Researchers from the universities of Oxford and Southampton looked at 64 multivitamins and found only 25%-36% provided the correct dose of 400 IU.  The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said the research was ""highly concerning"" and products were ""misleading parents"".  They recommend checking the dosage on the labelling of supplements. Vitamin D is important to prevent rickets in children, which affects bone growth and can lead to deformities.  The main source of vitamin D is sunshine but it is hard to get enough in the UK in autumn and winter.  Cases of rickets in the UK have increased in recent years. And in 2016 Public Health England recommended a daily supplement of 400 IU (international unit) (10 micrograms) of vitamin D for: The researchers looked at multivitamins and vitamin D supplements marketed at children aged under 12 and sold at Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Boots, Holland and Barrett, Lloyds Pharmacy and Superdrug and found: Writing in the Archives of Disease in Childhood journal, the authors said: ""Multivitamins typically had lower vitamin D content than pure vitamin D supplements or 'healthy bones' products, although some products labelled as 'for bones' contained very low levels of vitamin D."" To obtain the correct dose, they said, children ""would either have to take over the recommended dose, which may increase the risk of toxicity from the other components, or they would have to take a combination of vitamin D and multivitamins, which is more expensive"".  Vitamin D supplements are provided free to low income families on the government's Healthy Start scheme. But the researchers found the vitamins provided by the scheme gave only 300 IU per day of vitamin D. Dr Benjamin Jacobs, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), said: ""A normal healthy UK diet provides less than 10% of the recommended amount of vitamin D. ""To learn that so many products fail to provide children with the recommended level of Vitamin D is highly concerning, especially when latest evidence shows our children's average intake are still below the recommended amount. ""These products are misleading parents who think they are protecting their children from serious conditions such as rickets, poor growth and muscle weakness. ""I would advise all parents to check that the supplements they use contain the recommended 400 units of vitamin D and consult their pharmacist if they are unsure."" He also said the government should seriously consider fortifying some foods and milk with Vitamin D. Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the industry-funded health and food supplements information service (HSIS), said: ""Food supplements are meant to supplement the diet, not replace the nutrients obtained from foods. ""In that respect, and since there are varying recommendations across different age groups of children, it is right that different supplements offer different doses. ""Smaller doses allow parents to use the same product for younger and older children by varying the amount given. ""Many of the supplements in this survey would actually bridge the dietary gap topping up intake towards the recommended 10 microgram daily.""",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-47350835,"It will be compulsory to teach about periods at schools in England by 2020, which endometriosis sufferer Alice Smith calls ""massive"".  The 23-year-old was diagnosed with the chronic condition at 14 and has been campaigning for menstrual health to be on the school curriculum.  Alice says the new guidelines mean girls will know ""from a much younger age what is normal"" and what isn't when it comes to their periods.  Consent is also to be taught at school. And children will learn about domestic violence, relationships and staying safe online. ""My experience at school would be very different now,"" Alice says. Endometriosis, which affects one in 10 women in the UK, is where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows elsewhere in a woman's body. It causes chronic pain, fatigue, bowel and bladder problems, and can lead to infertility.  Alice first started having symptoms when she was 12, and was diagnosed with endometriosis two years later.  ""For any other illness that would be a long time but unfortunately that's a really quick diagnosis for endometriosis,"" she says.  She says being in hospital on morphine every two weeks, whenever she ovulated and had her period, is the reason it was picked up early.  But things didn't get any easier after the diagnosis.  ""I went home and googled it and my world fell apart really.  ""Reading that it was life-long and there's no cure, and we don't know what causes it. I was reading blogs by women who'd lost their jobs and their marriages had broken down because of it and they didn't have kids and they were suicidal. ""It felt like a death sentence."" Alice calls it her ""mission"" to make sure young girls being diagnosed with the condition now don't have to feel like that.  ""It really isn't the end of the world, it can get better and you should never ever give up with different doctors or trying different things."" And she says periods being taught in school, to boys as well as girls, is a step towards that.  ""That generation will have language in their vocabulary that we never had. ""They'll know how to describe things that we never did and they'll be talking about periods in school and the biology of it, and the science behind it, and endometriosis will be mentioned in the classroom,"" she says.  Sex education has been compulsory in England since 2017, but there has been a public consultation about what should be on the curriculum.  All pupils will now learn about menstrual health and the menstrual cycle starting in primary school.  Pupils will also learn about relationships, starting in primary school, and relationships and sex, starting in secondary school. The curriculum will also be LGBT inclusive. Alice says all she remembers learning about periods is watching a nurse put a tampon into a glass of water to show it expanding.  ""We were all sort of crossing our legs,"" she says.  She thinks that the new guidelines will create an ""open"" environment for kids to learn what is and isn't normal.  ""I probably would have gone to the doctor sooner and pushed harder because I wouldn't have put up with such horrific periods just thinking that they were normal.  ""Education plays a really important role in teaching young women how to talk about when their bodies aren't functioning properly."" For Alice, there will ""always be more"" campaigning to do on endometriosis, but she says we're ""heading in the right direction"" for more research to find out what causes it and find a cure.  On a personal level she says her body is ""irreparably damaged"" from endometriosis. ""I had it on my bowels, my bladder, and certain ligaments and so I've got chronic inflammation, and there's no cure for that - those organs don't really properly work."" She says she's in pain every single day and has just finished her second round of egg freezing because her fertility is low. ""The dream for me was to finish school, to go to university away from home, and also to get to a level where if you were to look at me and you were to know me, you wouldn't know I was ill unless I told you."" And she says while it's been a long road and there will be a life of managing the condition: ""I'm at that place now."" Sex education guidance is currently open for consultation in Wales, while in Northern Ireland the Department of Education requires each school to have its own written policy on how it will address the delivery of relationship and sex education. In Scotland, guidance on sex education was introduced in 2014 - although the curriculum is non-statutory and decisions about which topics are included in the curriculum is a matter for schools and local authorities to decide.

1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-47377818,"British teenager Shauna Davison was given an experimental transplant in 2012, in the hope of prolonging her life. Her mother says she was told in advance about two patients who had survived a similar operation - but not about others who had died. The BBC's Deborah Cohen asks whether Shauna, who died after two weeks, was a casualty of the rush to develop stem cell technology? Shauna Davison was born with one lung, a cleft palate and a major heart defect. But despite spending her life in and out of hospital she remained a happy child.  ""Her illness never got her down and she always had a smile on her face,"" says Shauna's mother, Karen Davison. ""Everyone was so nice to her. They looked beyond her problems."" When she was 12 weeks old, doctors found problems with her trachea - or windpipe. It was very narrow and when it became obstructed, she couldn't breathe. She was given 48 hours to live. A surgeon in Leeds came to the rescue. David Crabbe warned that it might not work, but he managed to rebuild Shauna's windpipe out of her ribs. Shauna had to stay in hospital for six months and had ring-shaped stents put in her windpipe to keep it open. Mr Crabbe was really caring, Karen Davison says. ""The hospital was outstanding."" Over the years, Shauna's stents needed dilating as she grew bigger. She had a tracheostomy  - an opening in the front of her neck - to help her breathe. ""There were times we didn't think she'd make it because she kept collapsing,"" Karen Davison says.  At home in Middlesbrough, she learned how to change Shauna's tracheostomy tube, use a ventilator, do physiotherapy to help her clear her airway, suction her airway, do CPR, and give her intravenous antibiotics.  ""I did everything for her,"" she says. ""Shauna coped marvellously. But she didn't know any different.""  An avid Middlesbrough Football Club fan, Shauna loved wearing a football kit. She went to a mainstream school, with the support of a carer, where she could mix with other children.  ""She was a cheeky child, but loved by everybody,"" her mother says. ""She brightened everyone's day."" Shauna had many operations but she'd always come through. At times, she didn't go near a hospital for ages, Karen says.  A time came, however, when David Crabbe told her that his technique for treating Shauna was no longer going to be sufficient. Her airway was too small and they would have to look for other options.  ""Mr Crabbe showed me pictures of a normal airway and her airway. It was tiny,"" Karen Davison says.  Shauna started to go to Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London for tests and to have her stent changed. In 2011, doctors there told her the airway wouldn't last much longer.  At 15, Shauna suffered a respiratory arrest - a serious incident in which she became unable to breathe - and the family was told about pioneering surgery by Prof Martin Elliott, a cardiothoracic surgeon and former medical director of Great Ormond Street Hospital. ""They said there'd been some research into tracheal transplants and there'd been two other cases where it'd been done, but they couldn't discuss them with me because of patient confidentiality,"" Karen Davison says. One of them was a 10-year-old boy, she adds.  ""It would be the only chance she'd have."" Shauna's transplant wasn't a conventional one.  She would receive a donor windpipe, but it would be laced with her own stem cells, making it almost like her own. She wouldn't need drugs to stop her body rejecting it. It was at the forefront of the new stem cell technology - and still very experimental.  Doctors can use experimental treatments if someone is terminally ill and there is no alternative treatment. It's called ""compassionate use"".  Karen says she was told Shauna wouldn't need a tracheostomy or a ventilator and she'd lead a normal life. But she was told about risks too, she adds - Shauna might still reject the transplant, and having a general anaesthetic is never risk-free.  Martin Elliott had previously worked closely with the internationally renowned Martin Birchall, professor of ENT at University College London (UCL), on implanting a stem-cell-laced donor trachea in another child. They would work together again in Shauna's case.  Shauna was being treated at Great Ormond Street at the time of a BBC documentary about the hospital in 2012. She was assessed by different specialists and asked what her hopes for the future were. Shauna told respiratory consultant Dr Martin Wallis she wanted to be able to go swimming.  It was not an easy decision to have the operation. In Martin Wallis's words, it was not a situation where there was nothing to lose. ""They've got quite a bit to lose. And this is going to make for a difficult decision,"" he said. ""She's got a reasonable quality of life, she's got her good friend, she clearly has a sense of humour and is enjoying herself - it makes it harder.""  ""I wanted her to have it done while she was well rather than wait until she was unwell and it might not happen,"" Karen Davison says.  But because it was such an experimental procedure, her medical team discussed it with the Great Ormond Street Hospital ethics committee.  ""I don't think she will die if we do the procedure. We're trying to do the procedure so that she doesn't. Or at least we prolong her life and her quality of life for as long as possible,"" the surgeon, Martin Elliott, tells the committee on camera.  ""They couldn't give me a time when she'd die but they said she will die eventually. Because her airway would just give up. So there was this procedure they said they were willing to do,"" Karen Davison says. ""Like any other parent, if you thought this was going to help your child live, I agreed to it.""  So in February 2012, Shauna was given a transplant of a donor trachea newly populated with her own stem cells.  Initially, everything seemed to go well. ""For the first couple of days she was marvellous,"" her mother recalls. ""I couldn't believe how well she recovered after it."" Two weeks after her operation Shauna was moved from Great Ormond Street by ambulance to a hospital in Leeds. But during the transfer Shauna started to cough a lot and was in need of suction to clear her throat. ""We thought that was strange, but thought it might have been due to the journey,"" Karen Davison says. ""I just thought, 'Another couple of weeks and we'll be home.'""  But the next morning, Shauna took a turn for the worse. ""Her chest was pulling in,"" Karen says. She remembers Shauna saying, ""Help me, help me.""  ""It was the worst day of my life because I couldn't help her."" Shauna's new trachea had collapsed. ""They said she'd struggled that much to breathe, her heart had given up,"" Karen Davison says.  ""She was a wonderful child. I miss her so much."" When the first transplant using a donated windpipe coated with the patient's own stem cells was carried out in 2008 it made global headlines. It was thought that stripping the donor's cells from the surface of the trachea and seeding it with the patient's own stem cells created a new organ that would be like the patient's own tissue. No anti-rejection drugs would be needed for the ""tissue-engineered"" trachea. The operation was carried out by Italian surgeon Paolo Macchiarini with the help of Martin Birchall, then a surgeon at Bristol University. The recipient was 30-year-old Claudia Castillo, who had tuberculosis in part of her windpipe that leads to the lungs - the bronchus. Her case was written up in The Lancet. Five months after she'd had her operation, she was reported to be in perfect health.  Martin Birchall, who had helped to prepare the donor trachea, said at the time that it would ""represent a huge step change in surgery. Surgeons can now start to see and understand the potential for adult stem cells and tissue engineering to radically improve their ability to treat patients with serious diseases."" Many around the world agreed. It was a ""milestone in medicine"", ""unadulterated good news"" and ""a textbook example of international collaboration"".  ""It was seen as revolutionary, as highly innovative… opening the door for new and exciting tech using a marriage between stem cells and artificial scaffolds that could bring forth this entirely new field of regenerative medicine,"" recalls Prof John Rasko, of the University of Sydney Faculty of Health Sciences. It had ""the whiff of a Nobel Prize about it,"" he says. Indeed, soon the university that hands out the Nobel Prize for medicine, Stockholm's prestigious Karolinska Institute, offered Macchiarini a post. Birchall, for his part, moved to University College London (UCL), where Macchiarini was also made an honorary professor. Claudia Castillo's operation served as a template and soon others had similar procedures. In 2010, Professor Birchall told a conference ""we have done a further five adults"". Apart from Shauna, UK patients given a tissue-engineered trachea include 19-year-old Keziah Shorten and 10-year-old Ciaran Finn-Lynch. Shauna's surgeon, Martin Elliott, led the transplant team that performed Ciaran's operation, with the help of Macchiarini and Birchall.  Like Claudia Castillo, his procedure was published in a medical journal and it garnered global headlines. Martin Birchall told journalists: ""He is left with a healthy organ there, made from his own stem cells, and that in a way is a kind of miracle."" But soon questions started to be asked about the stem-cell-laced tracheas.  For Macchiarini, this meant his meteoric rise was mirrored by a rapid fall from grace. He had switched from using donated tracheas to plastic ones, also laced with stem cells. The results were disastrous - his patients died. Macchiarini was investigated several times by Karolinska before he was fired. Allegations made against him were initially dismissed but the institute has since found him guilty of scientific misconduct and many of his scientific papers have been retracted. Swedish prosecutors reopened a criminal negligence investigation against him in December last year. He has previously denied any negligence. Bo Risberg, professor emeritus of surgery at the University of Gothenberg and a former chairman of the Swedish Ethics Council has said the events amount to the biggest research scandal Sweden has experienced in modern times. ""Everything was swept under the carpet,"" he said. Macchiarini's failure to do pre-clinical tests on animals using the plastic tracheas was ""the worst crime you can commit"", he added. One of Macchiarini's early critics was Pierre Delaere, professor of ENT at University Hospital Leuven in Belgium, who has argued that it is ""impossible from a theoretical point of view"" to establish a new blood supply to a tissue-engineered trachea, whether plastic or donated. In 2015, he wrote to UCL casting doubt on the idea of ""tracheal regeneration"", calling it ""the biggest lie in medical history"". By this time Macchiarini had left UCL.  In its subsequent unpublished report into Delaere's claims, seen by the BBC, UCL cast doubt on the suggestion that stem cells ""played any therapeutic role"" in Ciaran's operation.  But, it said, there was no ""deliberate fraud"" or ""intent to mislead"" on Martin Birchall's part. Because of the ""lack of intent to deceive"" the university recommended education and training rather than other formal procedures.  Meanwhile, the university was gearing up to conduct clinical trials into stem-cell-regenerated tracheas and larynxes - called Inspire and RegenVox respectively. Martin Birchall was principal investigator with responsibility for leading the trials. He and his team would bring in millions of pounds of research funding to the university. It wasn't the only time UCL produced a report into regenerative medicine at the university. In 2017, it published the findings of a special inquiry, set up after the Macchiarini revelations. This found no fault with Martin Birchall and cleared the way for future clinical trials to proceed.  It said that, when asked, Shauna's family ""were grateful for the opportunity that her daughter received and held no rancour with the tracheal team at GOSH"".  UCL told the BBC this was ""reported to the inquiry by the clinicians involved in the care of Shauna Davison"".  But Shauna's mother, Karen Davison, says no-one connected to the inquiry had ever asked for her views.  The more I have looked into Shauna Davison's story the more I have discovered that Karen Davison did not know. The two patients Karen and Shauna heard about were the 10-year-old boy, Ciaran Finn-Lynch, and Claudia Castillo, both of whom are still alive.  But they weren't told that Claudia Castillo's windpipe transplant collapsed just over three weeks after she'd had it and she needed stents to keep it open. (She's since had to have a lung removed.) Nor did Karen and Shauna hear about most of the other cases Martin Birchall talked about in 2010.  One of these operations was on Kent teenager Keziah Shorten, who about two years previously had been given a tissue-engineered donor trachea by Macchiarini in Florence, after she had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. But around a year after the operation, her transplant failed. Martin Birchall told a Swedish documentary in 2016 that her tissue-engineered windpipe had broken down. When she was subsequently operated on at University College London Hospital they replaced it with a plastic one. She died a month before Shauna's operation. According to John Rasko there is a ""strong obligation to give a full and frank account of all the information that's available. Exceptionalism and excluding bad cases is really something that is not acceptable."" A spokesperson for GOSH said: ""As a patient, Keziah's condition and her graft were very different to Shauna, so it was not clinically relevant to discuss her case."" The hospital added that the other patients were not discussed ""because the team did not know of other relevant cases from overseas at this time"". There was more that Karen and Shauna did not know. They did hear about Ciaran Finn-Lynch. But there were key differences between Shauna's operation and his.  Ciaran had received a stent - but Shauna didn't. According to the 2017 UCL inquiry report, Martin Elliott said that he had wanted to use a stent but was advised not to. Ciaran had also received a fresh donor trachea. Shauna's wasn't fresh. It had been frozen and then thawed.  It was a treatment that hadn't been used before - after the trachea had been thawed, the donor's cells had been removed using a special vacuum technique exclusive to members of Shauna's medical team.  Trish Murray, professor of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at Liverpool University, has a number of criticisms. ""The reality is that if you don't have a stent, the trachea will collapse, that's been the unanimous experience of all patients who've experienced trachea transplantation,"" she says.  ""So although it's well-known that stents cause problems, if you don't have a stent, then the trachea will collapse and the patient will suffocate."" Another issue was the frozen trachea. For the team it made perfect sense to freeze a trachea, as the trachea could be stored up in advance and thawed when needed. But Trish Murray is critical of this decision too.  ""Ciaran's trachea was not frozen beforehand whereas Shauna's was freeze-thawed and we know from papers that the group themselves have published that that would weaken the trachea... and that would make it more likely to collapse after it had been implanted,"" she says.  However, UCL questions the relevance of these studies. It has told the BBC that they do not refer to the technique used on Shauna. Trish Murray says other worrying studies should have rung alarm bells. She points to an unpublished study looking at the vacuum technique, which shows that one pig that received a transplant died spontaneously and another developed ""respiratory compromise"" and had to be put down. The study was stopped on humane grounds. ""We know from information that's been obtained from FOI requests that the team in UCL have tried the technique on two pigs and both pigs died quite quickly. We also know that they've tried it on rabbits and there was 100% mortality in the rabbits as well,"" she says.  The BBC asked UCL and Great Ormond Street whether the animal studies were done before or after Shauna's operation, but received no reply to this question.  And like Belgian ENT professor Pierre Delaere, Trish Murray questions the role the stem cells played. ""There's actually no evidence that any of those cells survive, in fact quite a lot of evidence that they don't survive,"" she says. But how were doctors and scientists involved in the care of seriously ill patients able to use these tracheas when there was little evidence that they worked?  Usually, researchers have to test their innovation in the lab and then on animals in preclinical research. Only then - with formal approval from a research ethics committee and the regulators - does it move into humans.  Martin Birchall, however, wrote in the Lancet that ""compassionate studies"", the procedure for using new treatments on very ill patients, were ""powerful ways to inform robustly designed formal trials"" and would ""expedite the testing of novel therapies"". ""The surgeons involved have used this apparent loophole of compassionate use to actually experiment on patients and then they've used the data that they've obtained to go to the regulatory authorities to get permission for the trials,"" Trish Murray says. John Rasko agrees with Trish Murray that this is not how the system should work. ""Exercising the option of compassionate use brings with it great responsibility. It shouldn't be used as a way that doctors can fly under the radar of properly undertaken regulated medical practice,"" he says. And Great Ormond Street agrees too. ""We do not see compassionate use as a way of testing novel treatments,"" a spokesperson said.  But Shauna's transplant, and those of other patients, were used to obtain funding and approval for clinical trials, as well as being written about in medical journals and an application to the European Medicines Agency.   The BBC has found that at least seven of these documents and publications misrepresent Shauna's treatment or death in some way. For example, in one 2016 application to the European Medicines Agency, Martin Birchall is cited as saying Shauna's initial surgery was successful but she suffered a ""fatal cardiovascular event six weeks following surgery"" - whereas in fact she died after two weeks, because her trachea had collapsed. By the time the clinical trial to test the tissue-engineered trachea transplants was approved and funded by public bodies, a change had been made to the procedure. Having learned from what happened to Shauna, the team would make sure patients in the trial had a stent. And even then, the approved patient information sheets accompanying one of the trials contained erroneous information about Shauna and indeed about Claudia Castillo. Only they and Ciaran Finn-Lynch were included in the information sheet - despite the team knowing about at least 10 cases worldwide. As early as 2014, Martin Elliott had told a conference 10 patients had received a tissue-engineered trachea, all of whom had died apart from Claudia and Ciaran. Last year, the clinical trials were suspended. UCL says no-one had been recruited to participate. Much of what the BBC has uncovered about what happened to Shauna does not appear in UCL's special inquiry report. Leonid Schneider is a molecular-cell-biologist-turned-journalist who has been covering regenerative medicine since 2016. He was called to give evidence at UCL's inquiry and is damning in his appraisal of their report. ""Why didn't Shauna's mother have the full information? And whose idea it was not to give her a stent?"" he asks.   ""Finally, how could UCL investigators recommend the donor trachea clinical trials to resume, after Prof Delaere and myself told them how many people have died of it?"" he adds. UCL says that clinical care was ""beyond the scope of the inquiry"".  It adds: ""Any research undertaken at UCL is required to conform to the highest legal, ethical and regulatory standards, and we will not hesitate to take the necessary action, if and when this falls short."" After receiving ethical advice, I told Karen what the BBC had found out about tissue-engineered transplants. She was upset. She said this might have changed her decision about allowing Shauna's operation to go ahead. ""I hope that nobody else has to go through what I've gone through, I really do. They should be stopped. That is such a shock. People ask me, 'How did Shauna die?' And I always say, heart attack. I've never once blamed those surgeons for her death. They have a lot to account for."" GOSH said: ""Before Shauna's operation was carried out a comprehensive review was conducted of all the relevant published scientific and medical evidence."" They also said: ""We are sorry the treatment did not work for Shauna and the family feel they did not receive all relevant information. We are contacting Shauna's family to offer to meet them to talk through any concerns.""

1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47370498,"A radical Parkinson's treatment that delivers a drug directly to the brain has been tested in people. Patients in the trial were either given the drug, which is administered via a ""port"" in the side of the head, or a dummy treatment (placebo). Both groups showed improved symptoms, meaning it was not clear if the drug was responsible for the benefits.  However, scans did find visual evidence of improvements to affected areas of the brain in those given the drug. The study's authors say it hints at the possibility of ""reawakening"" brain cells damaged by the condition.  Other experts, though, say it is too early to know whether this finding might result in improvements in Parkinson's symptoms.  Researchers believe the port implant could also be used to administer chemotherapy to those with brain tumours or to test new drugs for Alzheimer's and stroke patients. Parkinson's causes parts of the brain to become progressively damaged, resulting in a range of symptoms, such as involuntary shaking and stiff, inflexible muscles. About 145,000 people in the UK have been diagnosed with the degenerative condition, which cannot be slowed down or reversed. For this new study, scientists gave patients an experimental treatment called glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), in the hope it could regenerate dying brain cells and even reverse the condition. Participants underwent robot-assisted surgery to have four tubes placed into their brains, which allowed GDNF to be infused directly to the affected areas with pinpoint accuracy, via a port in their head. After an initial safety study of six people, 35 patients took part in a nine-month ""blinded"" trial, where half were randomly assigned to receive monthly infusions of GDNF and the other half dummy infusions. Dr Alan Whone, principal investigator, said patients in the trial had, on average, been diagnosed eight years previously, but brain scans of those given the drug showed images that would be expected just two years after diagnosis. He said: ""We've shown with the Pet [positron emission tomography] scans that, having arrived, the drug then engages with its target, dopamine nerve endings, and appears to help damaged cells regenerate or have a biological response.""  Tom Phipps, 63, from Bristol, said he had noticed an improvement during the trial and had been able to reduce the drugs he takes for his condition. Since it ended, he has slowly increased his medication but is continuing to ride his bike, dig his allotment and chair his local branch of Parkinson's UK. ""My outcome was as positive as I could have wished for,"" he said.  ""I feel the trial brought me some time and has delayed the progress of my condition. ""The best part was absolutely being part of a group of people who've got a similar goal - not only the team of consultants and nurses but also the participants. ""You can't have expectations - you can only have hope.""  Following the initial nine months on GDNF or placebo, all participants had the opportunity to receive GDNF for a further nine months. By 18 months, when all participants had received GDNF, both groups showed moderate to large improvements in symptoms compared with their scores before they started the study.  But the authors say the results need to be treated with caution because of the possibility of the placebo effect - when a patient feels better despite taking a medicine with no active ingredient.  Researchers hope that further trials could look at increasing the doses of GDNF or the duration of treatment. Experts said it was ""disappointing"" that the difference in symptoms was not significant. But they said the study was still of ""great interest"" and warranted follow up research. The findings from the trials are published in the medical journals Brain and the Journal of Parkinson's Disease. The study also features in a two-part BBC Two documentary series, The Parkinson's Drug Trial: A Miracle Cure? on 28 February and 7 March, at 21:00. Follow Alex on Twitter.",,,,

The baby was born by emergency C-section in August, and was so small he could fit into a pair of cupped hands.  The infant was nurtured in intensive care until he was released last week, two months after his due date.  He had grown to a weight of 3.2kg, and is now feeding normally.  Born at 24 weeks, the tiny boy spent five months in hospital.  ""I can only say I'm happy that he has grown this big because honestly, I wasn't sure he could survive,"" the boy's mother said, according to Tokyo's Keio University Hospital. Doctor Takeshi Arimitsu, who treated the extraordinary baby, told the BBC he was the smallest infant born (on record) to be discharged from a hospital, according to a database of the world's littlest babies held by the University of Iowa. He said he wanted to show that ""there is a possibility that babies will be able to leave the hospital in good health, even though they are born small"". The previous record-holder was a boy born in Germany, weighing 274g. The smallest surviving baby girl in that same database was also born in Germany, in 2015, and reportedly weighed 252g.  Keio University Hospital said the survival rate of babies born weighing less than a kilogram is about 90% in Japan. But for those born under 300g, that falls to around 50%. Among the very smallest babies, the survival rate is much lower for boys than girls. Medical experts are unsure why, though some believe it could be linked to the slower development of male babies' lungs.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47371431,"Doctors have documented what they say is only the world's second known case of ""semi-identical"" twins. The boy and the girl, now four, from Brisbane, in Australia, are identical on their mother's side. But they share only a proportion of their father's DNA - placing them, genetically, somewhere between fraternal and identical twins. Experts say the phenomenon is extremely rare - embryos such as these often do not survive.  Prof Nicholas Fisk, who led the team that cared for the mother and twins at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in 2014, said the discovery was made through a routine pregnancy scan.  It is the first time semi-identical twins have been identified during pregnancy.  The first-time mother was 28 at the time and had conceived naturally, doctors said.  The case is being reported on in The New England Journal of Medicine. ""The mother's ultrasound at six weeks showed a single placenta and positioning of amniotic sacs that indicated she was expecting identical twins,"" Prof Fisk said.  ""However, an ultrasound at 14 weeks showed the twins were male and female, which is not possible for identical twins."" Identical, or monozygotic, twins occur when a single egg, fertilised by a single sperm, divides and makes two babies.  These twins will be the same sex and share the same genes and physical features.  Non-identical, or dizygotic, twins occur when two separate eggs are fertilised, each by a different sperm, and develop in the womb at the same time.  These twins can be the same or different sexes and are no more alike than any brother or sister, despite being born together. In this case of semi-identical, or sesquizygotic, twins, the egg is thought to have been fertilised simultaneously by two sperm before it divided. If one egg is fertilised by two sperm, it results in three sets of chromosomes, rather than the standard two - one from the mother and two from the father.  And, according to researchers, three sets of chromosomes are ""typically incompatible with life and embryos do not usually survive"".  The identity of the twins has not been revealed.  Non-identical twins are more common than identical twins and are much more likely to run in families.  Older mothers are also more likely to have non-identical twins because they are more likely to release more than one egg during ovulation.  Infertility treatment - IVF - can increase the chance of twins, as more than one embryo may be put into the womb.  According to the Twins and Multiple Births Association (Tamba), about 12,000 twin births occur each year in the UK.  The first documented case of half-identical twins was in the US in 2007.  Prof Fisk said an analysis of worldwide twin databases highlighted just how rare sesquizygotic twins were. He and his colleagues examined genetic data from 968 fraternal twins, as well as a number of large global studies, but found no other case of sesquizygotic twins. ""We know this is an exceptional case of semi-identical twins,"" Prof Fisk added.  ""While doctors may keep this in mind in apparently identical twins, its rarity means there is no case for routine genetic testing.""",,,,

But according to a new survey, for some with the illness the words are seen as inappropriate rather than uplifting. The UK poll by Macmillan Cancer Support of 2,000 people who have or had cancer found ""cancer-stricken"" and ""victim"" were also among the least-liked terms. The charity said it showed how ""divisive"" simple descriptions of cancer can be. Calling a person's cancer diagnosis a ""war"" or a ""battle"" and saying they had ""lost their battle"" or ""lost their fight"" when they died, were other unpopular descriptions, according to the poll carried out by YouGov. Articles in the media and posts on social networks were found to be the worst offenders for using such language. The survey found a preference for factual words to describe people with cancer, their diagnosis, and when someone with the illness dies. Mandy Mahoney, 47, has incurable metastatic breast cancer. The outreach support worker, from London, was initially diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 and it has since returned five times.  She said: ""I think cancer-speak can be quite negatively loaded - the brave, fighter, warrior and survivor standard descriptors put an awful lot of pressure on the newly diagnosed."" Mandy said she also objected to describing people as ""losing their battle"" with cancer. ""That confers that you didn't fight or gave up,"" she said. Instead, she prefers ""clear, factual language"" and describes herself simply as ""living with incurable cancer"". ""I'm not brave or inspirational, I'm just trying to live the life I have left well,"" she added. However, Craig Toley, who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2016 and is now in remission, said he thought some of the more positive terms could be empowering. The 31-year-old, who is a powerlifter in his spare time, says: ""Language like 'fight', 'struggle', 'warrior' and 'battle' will be interpreted differently by different people.  ""Personally, I found those words helped empower me a lot and made me think of my cancer as a challenge I needed to fight.  ""Everyone likes the story of a fighter.""  Karen Roberts, chief nursing officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""These results show just how divisive and 'Marmite' simple words and descriptions can be.  ""Cancer throws all kinds of things your way, and struggling to find the words, and the emotional turmoil caused when our friends and family don't get it 'right' only makes lives feel even more upended. ""By drawing attention to this we want to encourage more people to talk about the words they prefer to hear, and stop the damage that can be caused to people's wellbeing and relationships.""  Mandy said it was not necessary for people to ""swallow a textbook and come up with all of the key phrases"" to talk to someone with cancer, and it is fine to not always know what to say.  ""If you tell me it's awkward and you don't know what to say I will find a way to make that right for you, and actually on some occasions I might say 'we don't have to talk about it'. ""But just be real."" Macmillan Cancer Support has launched a campaign to highlight the challenges posed by a cancer diagnosis and the support available.",,,,

The aim is that ""link workers"" will support GPs and reduce their workload. A link worker's role is to help patients find suitable community activities to improve their health and wellbeing. The NHS says more than 1,000 will be recruited by 2020-21. In the long term, it wants link workers to handle around 900,000 patient appointments a year. It is thought that a significant number of appointments at GP surgeries are not directly related to medical conditions. Instead, many patients are anxious or lonely or need support with managing a long-term condition. Some just need encouragement to join an exercise group and lose weight. A few years ago, Arif Qureshi, 51, was told he had pre-diabetes.  He knew he had to improve his lifestyle so a link worker referred him to a walking football club run by West Ham United Foundation in Newham. He says it's been a revelation, helping him to lose 2st 4lb (15kg) in four months. ""It's been a big thing for me,"" he says.  ""I'm more energetic, more upbeat and people come to me for advice on health now. ""I've got a new lease of life from exercise."" But he says he wouldn't have joined the football group, or found it, if hadn't been been for the nudge from the NHS and his link worker, who keeps in touch and assesses his progress regularly. Link workers are part of NHS England's plans to personalise care for patients, so they can take greater control of their mental and physical health. James Sanderson, NHS England's director of personalised care, said 2.5 million people would benefit by 2024.  ""Social prescribing is an important component of the NHS comprehensive model of personalised care and there is emerging evidence that it can lead to a range of positive health and wellbeing outcomes for people, such as improved quality of life and emotional wellbeing,"" he said.  ""The aim is that social prescribing schemes lead to a substantial reduction in the use of NHS services, including GP attendances."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said the move was ""incredibly welcome"". She said ensuring that GPs have ""good, easy access to people who can link patients with classes or groups in the community, which could be of more benefit than any medicine..."" is something doctors have been calling for for a long time.",,,,

Researchers at Aberystwyth University found all products - ranging from £20 to £80 in price - were inaccurate during walking and running tests.  Dr Rhys Thatcher said devices had an ""inherent tendency"" to over-measure. Fitbit said its product was based on ""extensive research"", but others said theirs were ""not medical devices"". The tests, carried out for the BBC X-Ray programme, measured the amount of oxygen a volunteer used during ten minute walking and running sessions on a treadmill, before comparing it to the various fitness trackers.  The Fitbit Charge 2, which is the best selling fitness tracker on the market, was very accurate in testing calories burned while running, underestimating by 4%. But when measuring walking, it overestimated by more than 50%.  Cheaper devices - the Letscom HR and the Letsfit - underestimated the number of calories burned while running by 33% and 40% respectively. But both were far more accurate in the walking test. The Letscom overestimated by 15.7% while the Letsfit was only 2% above the official measurement. ""If you want to know the exact number of calories that you are burning during an exercise session then it doesn't matter which device you use, you have to interpret the data with some caution,"" Dr Thatcher said. He added the inaccuracies were not important if they were being used as a motivational tool or to track progress.  Fitbit said it was confident about the performance of its product.

1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-47022070,"Researchers at the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute have genetically modified chickens to produce human proteins in their eggs.  They hope the project will one day lead to lifesaving drugs that are much cheaper to make.  The team modified the genomes of the chickens so their eggs contain large amounts of high quality proteins.  Just three eggs contain a clinically significant dose, according to the scientists. Initially the proteins will be used in research but laboratory tests have already found they work at least as well as equivalent drugs.   Protein-based therapies such as the cancer treatments Herceptin and Avastin can be effective where traditional drugs fail but they are highly expensive.  The new research - a collaboration between the institute and the university's spinout company Roslin Technologies - holds out the promise of a far cheaper production process. We meet the medicine makers of tomorrow in a secure facility at the Institute.  Dozens of transgenic chickens are kept in rows of spacious pens.  Their job is straightforward enough: lay 300 eggs a year.  There are cockerels here too.   Their purpose is to make more transgenic chickens.  These creatures are not clones. New generations of protein producers are made in the conventional, biological way.  Professor Helen Sang of the Institute says it's a cost effective way of scaling up production:  ""If you want more eggs you just need more birds.""  ""That's why in this pen we have a cockerel - and he can produce an awful lot of children in a short time.  ""So we can produce a lot of hens in a short period if we want to bulk up the supply of the drug.""  In a laboratory away from the cacophony of the chicken shed, Dr Lissa Herron of Roslin Technologies produces a tray of brown eggs that would grace any breakfast table. But these ones will never enter the food chain. ""It's quite old fashioned initially,"" she says.  ""We just crack the egg. I've become quite adept at cracking eggs over the years.""  The golden yolk is put to one side unneeded.   It's the egg white that contains the treasure: large quantities of medically important proteins.  ""These proteins are really, really expensive to produce,"" she says, ""because you can't just synthesise them in a chemistry lab.  ""You need a living system to manufacture them because proteins are very large molecules, very complex and they need all of the machinery of a cell to make them and fold them properly.""  So far the the chickens have been genetically modified to produce two types of protein.  One is Macrophage-CSF. It is being is being developed as a therapy that stimulates damaged tissues to repair themselves.  It is being produced in human and pig versions.  The other is called Interferon Alfa-2A.  ""This is a human protein that is native in our bodies - it's expressed as part of our immune system,"" Dr Herron says.  ""It has antiviral properties. It's also been found that is has some anti-cancer properties.  ""It's a protein that is used in the clinic today - or has been for quite some time - for treating hepatitis and certain cancers.""  As with all research into promising treatments there is a caveat. It can take decades of further research and testing before a breakthrough becomes a medicine.   However treatments for rare, so-called 'orphan' diseases can be fast-tracked - and drugs for animals tend to come on the market even more quickly.  By reducing the cost of protein therapies the new technique could create affordable treatments for farm animals and pets, opening up a new market in the veterinary sector.  Dr Herron knows just how effective protein therapies can be: she received an existing drug for inflammatory bowel disease.  ""It was a pretty incredible thing,"" she says. ""I went from Friday, when I was probably going to have my entire bowel removed, to Monday going home.  ""It's pretty impressive type of stuff we can do with some of these drugs.  ""So hopefully we can get these out there and treat some of these really difficult illnesses.""  The team are confident they can expand the range of proteins chickens can lay.  The technique used to introduce the new genes into chicken DNA employed a lentivirus to deliver the payload.  It is long established but involves trial and error before the genes find their desired target.  The newer CRISPR/Cas method is expected to allow much more precise editing.  The researchers received strategic funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and published their findings in the journal BMC Biotechnology.  The chickens themselves are unaffected by the presence of human proteins in their systems.  Living in conditions superior to those of battery hens, they just go on laying eggs as normal.  EU regulations against GM organisms in the food chain mean neither they nor their eggs will end up on your plate.  But they could be pioneers in producing better and cheaper medicines.  Cheaper because they literally work for chicken feed.",,,,

Authorities revealed details about the 2016 health data breach on Monday. They believe an HIV-positive American whose partner was a senior Singaporean doctor is behind the leak. The hack comes just months after the records of 1.5m Singaporeans, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, were stolen last year. Confidential information including names, addresses, HIV status and other medical information is reportedly included in the latest breach. Officials say the details of 5,400 Singaporeans and 8,800 foreigners dating up to January 2013 have been compromised. Until 2015, foreigners with HIV were not allowed to visit the city state, even as tourists. Now, anyone who wants to stay beyond 90 days, including for work, is subject to mandatory medical screening to make sure they do not have HIV. Officials believe a 33-year-old US citizen who lived in Singapore from 2008 is behind the leak. Mikhy Farrera-Brochez was convicted and jailed for fraud and drug-related offences in 2016 and was deported last year. He is the former partner of Ler Teck Siang, the former head of Singapore's National Public Health Unit, who was convicted of helping Farrera-Brochez falsify his medical records to disguise his HIV-positive status. Officials said Ler offered his own blood labelled as Farrera-Brochez's to allow him entry to the country. In a statement, the health ministry blamed Ler for the breach, accusing him of not complying with the policies regarding the handling of confidential data. They said they were first made aware in 2016 that the American may have had confidential information - but thought all material had been seized and secured by police.  They say they were notified on 22 January this year that Farrera-Brochez could still have possession of the HIV registry data.  ""I'm sorry that one of our former staff who was authorised to have access to confidential information in our HIV registry appears to not have complied with our security guidelines,"" Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said at a Monday news conference, Singapore's Today Online news website reports.  On Monday, health officials said they had tried to contact ""virtually all"" of permanent resident and Singaporeans on the list - but had only managed to speak to about 900. A hotline has been set up for those affected, and counselling will be offered, Ministry of Health Permanent Secretary Chan Heng Kee confirmed.

1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47026834,"Letting a toddler spend lots of time using screens may delay their development of skills such as language and sociability, according to a large Canadian study.  The research, which tracked nearly 2,500 two-year-olds, is the latest piece of evidence in the debate about how much screen time is safe for kids.  In Canada and the US, experts say children should not use screens before they are at least 18 months old.  But UK guidelines  set no such limit. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says there is not enough evidence, even when you include this new study, for a ""direct toxic effect"". Mums were surveyed (between 2011 and 2016) about screen use, and filled out questionnaires about their child's skills and development at ages two, three and five.  Screen time included watching TV programmes, films or videos, gaming, and using a computer, tablet, phone or any other screen-based device. At the age of two, the children were clocking up around 17 hours of screen time per week.  This increased to around 25 hours a week by the age of three but dropped to around 11 hours a week at the age of five, when the children started primary school.  The findings, published in the JAMA Paediatrics, suggest increased viewing begins before any delay in development can be seen, rather than children with poor developmental performance then going on to have more screen time.  But it is not clear whether screen time - including how much or what type - is directly to blame. Screen use might just go hand-in-hand with other things linked to delayed development, such as upbringing and how a child's remaining leisure time is spent.   When young children are observing screens, they may be missing important opportunities to practise and master other important skills. In theory, it could get in the way of social interactions and may limit how much time young children spend running, climbing and practising other physical skills - although they may still eventually catch up.  Even without solid proof of harm, Dr Sheri Madigan and colleagues say it still makes sense to moderate children's screen time and make sure it doesn't interfere with ""face-to-face interactions or family time"". They also said that, with hindsight, perhaps they should have followed the children from an even younger age because it is becoming increasingly common for 12-month-old babies to be watching and using screens. It is a good question, without a satisfactory answer.   The new study does not make any recommendation about how much is too much. Some of the two-year-olds were getting more than four hours a day or 28 hours a week of screen use, according to their mums.  The American Association of Paediatrics' (AAP) guidelines on screen time say:  The Canadian Paediatric Society goes further, saying screen time for children younger than two is not recommended.  The UK's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) put out guidelines earlier this year, but sets no limit.  It says ""evidence is weak for a threshold to guide children and parents to the appropriate level of screen time, and we are unable to recommend a cut-off for children's screen time overall"". Instead, it advises families to ask themselves: If a family can ask themselves these questions, and are satisfied with the answers, then they can be reassured that they are ""likely to be doing as well as they can with this tricky issue"", says the RCPCH. The AAP advises families to designate media-free times together, such as dinner or driving, as well as media-free locations at home, such as bedrooms. The RCPCH says adults should consider their own use of screens and set a good example.  Most experts also advise that children are not exposed to screens for an hour before bed, so that their brains have time to wind down for sleep. Dr Bernadka Dubicka, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""We still need more research to tell us which children are most vulnerable to the harms of screen use and the impact it may have on a child's mental health.  ""We also need to look at the effects of different content as there are also many positive ways of using screens.""",,,,

Dr William Eidelman, a natural medicine physician, said small doses of marijuana would help control the child's temper tantrums.  The doctor misdiagnosed the child as having bipolar disorder and attention deficit disorder (ADD). The Medical Board of California ruled to revoke the doctor's licence but he has launched an appeal. The board did not seek to revoke the licence because the doctor had prescribed cannabis to a child, which is legal for medicinal purposes in the state of California. Dr Eidelman was investigated due to being ""negligent in his care and treatment"" - he had failed to consult a psychiatrist in the case or communicate with the school. The boy's father consulted Dr Eidelman in September 2012 because his son was misbehaving at school. The doctor recommended small amounts of the drug, which was revealed when the school nurse was asked to give the boy his cannabis cookies at lunchtime. As a child, the boy's father had ADHD and bipolar disorder himself and had a negative experience with prescribed medications at the time, saying he felt like a ""human guinea pig"". He started using marijuana later in life, saying it helped ""calm him"" and changed his behaviour towards his wife, towards whom he had previously ""exhibited anger"". The father had previously obtained the drug for his older son, who had also been diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar disorder.  He said marijuana had had a ""positive effect"" on both his children. Dr Eidelman has appealed against the ruling, made on 4 January, and says he will continue to practise. His lawyers said he had won a suspension of the revocation, pending a future hearing. Medicinal cannabis usage has been legal in California since 1996, and Dr Eidelman estimates that he has recommended the drug to thousands of patients.",,,,

Currently, it is recommended patients with persistent hoarseness or an unexplained neck lump are investigated for throat or laryngeal cancer. However, Cancer Research UK's Weilin Wu said patients should not be alarmed. ""A sore throat on its own wasn't linked to laryngeal cancer,"" he said. ""But importantly, this study also provides the best evidence to date to support the current recommendation to refer older patients with persistent hoarseness."" The larynx is part of the throat found at the entrance of the windpipe that helps you breathe and speak.  In the UK, there are around 2,000 new cases of laryngeal cancer each year. The research, led by the University of Exeter, looked at patient records from more than 600 GP practices and studied 806 patients diagnosed with cancer of the larynx and 3,559 control patients. It is published in the British Journal of General Practice. Lead author Dr Elizabeth Shephard said it was the first real look at all the symptoms that might be important for laryngeal cancer.  ""The significance of the study really is that we've found that hoarseness is important for laryngeal cancer, but significantly the risk of having laryngeal cancer greatly increases when it's combined with a recurrent sore throat,"" she said. Source: NHS Choices One of the study authors, Prof Willie Hamilton, was the clinical lead for the current guidelines from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).  He said their research is important because it ""has shown the potential severity of some symptom combinations previously thought to be low risk.""  ""When NICE guidance for cancer investigation was published, there was no evidence from GP practices to guide this - nor to inform GPs,"" he said.   But he points out they are not talking about just any sore throat  - ""the sore throat has to be significant enough to go to the GP"".  ""We're all used to sore throats, but the sore throats that are reported to GPs are already unusual because it's gone outside the patient's norms.""   And it is the combination of persistent symptoms - sore throat, hoarseness and breathing or swallowing problems - that could be a warning sign, he said. Dr Shephard said the study will feed into the NICE guidelines when they are updated.  ""It's vital for selecting the right patients for referral. If we get people earlier we can then diagnose the cancer at an earlier stage and they will have access to the right treatment.""",,,,

The government says food supplies will be secure whether we leave the EU with or without a deal. But what would happen if you did cut out fresh fruit and veg and ate only tinned goods?  In 2017, BBC Radio Derby's Andy Twigge set himself a challenge of eating only canned food for a week.  ""I did it for a laugh really.  ""I love tinned potatoes and marrowfat peas, so I wondered what it would be like to live off tinned food for a while. I set myself a week. I thought it should be quite easy."" He almost managed it, but quit on day seven. The thing that broke him? A Sunday roast.   ""I stuck at it for six days. I even ate tinned Brussels sprouts!  ""I did have a Fray Bentos pie, and that was very nice, but it did all become a bit of a chore. I was physically fine on it though. I didn't waste away or anything."" He says he's not sure he would call what he did ""nutritional"". Because he was only doing the diet for a short period, Andy didn't check with a dietitian.  But we have, and here's what they think. To be tinned, foods are sealed and preserved by pressure cooking them at a very high temperature. Like regular cooking, this destroys some of the nutrients. Canned foods are often thought to be less nutritious than fresh or frozen foods because of this. But that's not always the case, say diet experts. Bridget Benelam is a nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation.  She says: ""Generally speaking, there's a wide range of canned foods that you could eat - from fruit, veg, potatoes and pulses to fish and ready-made foods like soup, baked beans or chilli.  ""And some of them are nutritionally better than others. Tinned oily fish like salmon, for example, is healthy. And beans and pulses, like chickpeas and lentils, are a good source of protein and fibre while being low in fat. ""Unfortunately, there's not a lot of data about nutrients in canned food versus fresh or frozen."" She said the main nutrients that could be lost or diminished in the canning process were some of the water-soluble vitamins which cannot be stored by the body and are vital for healthy skin, blood vessels and bones, and the nervous system.  Researchers have attempted to measure the loss, comparing fresh, frozen and canned fruit and veg. Findings suggest that although frozen foods lose fewer nutrients initially when they are packaged, when you get them home and eventually boil them, they can lose a similar amount to the tinned version.  Likewise, although freshly picked, uncooked fruit and veg contain lots of nutrients, these will degrade over time, even when you store them in the fridge.  Bridget says: ""With tinned foods, there may be some losses of nutrients like vitamin C and thiamine, which can be lost when cooking, but whether this would have an impact on health would depend on the diet overall. ""Nutritionally, it could be OK, as long as you get a good mix. My main concern would be the tedium. The texture could be quite dull. Food can get a bit mushed and squished when it is canned. You won't be able to have tinned salad, so you'd have to make sure you are getting the right variety of food."" So, when it comes to picking, what are the pitfalls? Dietitian Frankie Phillips, from the British Dietetic Association, agrees that variety is the key.  ""You'd be fine over a few days, but a tinned food diet might be quite limiting over a long period of time. You'd need to be quite careful about what cans you choose to eat."" Ingredients such as salt, sugar and fat are sometimes added to processed foods to make their flavour more appealing.  That means you could consume more than the recommended amounts and take on more calories than you need. ""This is where you might fall down in terms of nutrition,"" says Frankie. Fruit tinned in syrup will contain lots of sugar, for example, and vegetables in brine will be salty. But all fruit and veg canned in their own juice will count towards your 5-a-day. Frankie says: ""It should be quite easy to get most of your major food groups, such as protein, carbohydrates. Dairy might be a bit harder.  ""One of the concerns I would have is around canned meats. They are generally quite salty because of the way they are preserved. ""Nutrition labels on cans will help guide you,"" says Frankie. The guidelines for adults are: There are some other practical considerations too, including food safety. Cans are made of steel, with a fine coating of tin or chromium oxide to protect them from rusting. For acidic foods like tomatoes, a thin coating or lacquer is needed on the inside of the can.  When you open a can of food and you're not going to use all the food straightaway, empty the food into a bowl, or another container, and put it in the fridge, food safety experts advise. It's best not to store food in an opened tin can, or re-use empty cans to cook or store food. This is because when a can has been opened and the food is open to the air, the tin from the can might transfer more quickly to the can's contents. This advice doesn't apply to foods sold in cans that have resealable lids, such as golden syrup and cocoa, because these types of food don't react with the can. The US food safety regulator has some more advice: Some people worry that cans can contain harmful chemicals, including a substance called Bisohenol A (BPA). BPA is mainly used to make plastics, including containers that come into contact with food, but it's also used to make some protective coatings and linings for food and drinks cans. The UK's Food Standards Agency has examined BPA, and says that levels of the compound people would typically consume do not represent a risk to consumers. The European Food Safety Authority has also assessed the evidence and says dietary exposure to BPA is ""not a health concern for any age group"". The US National Toxicology Programme has been carrying out a long-term study into BPA, looking at the effects of exposure in rats before and after giving birth to see if there might be any link to diseases such as cancer. A final report is expected in the autumn of 2019. The history of canning is said to have begun with Napoleon. It's believed he offered 12,000 French francs to anyone who could find a way to prevent military food supplies from spoiling. Napoleon gave the prize in 1795 to Nicholas Appert, who invented the process of packing meat and poultry in glass bottles, corking them, and submerging them in boiling water.  This military secret soon reached England where, in 1810, Peter Durand patented the use of metal containers for canning. Today, we still love canned food. According to consumer research group Kantar Worldpanel, people in the UK spent more than half a billion pounds on tinned food during the 12 weeks to 30 December 2018. Unsurprisingly, we tend to buy more canned products over winter than summer.  A study of 2,000 adults carried out for the Metal Packaging Manufacturers Association found the average adult has 16 cans of food in their cupboard and relies on tinned food for at least three meals a week. Baked beans were named as the most popular canned food to use in everyday cooking, followed by tinned tomatoes, soup, fish such as tuna and salmon and other vegetables such as sweetcorn.",,,,
1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-47047579,"It's not unusual for Dutch patients with dementia to request euthanasia, but in the later stages of the disease they may be incapable of reconfirming their consent - one doctor is currently facing prosecution in such a case. But fear of being refused is pushing some to ask to die earlier than they would have liked. Annie Zwijnenberg was never in any doubt. ""The neurologist said: 'I'm sorry, but there's no way we can mistake this - it's Alzheimer's,"" says Anneke Soute-Zwijnenberg, describing the moment her mother was first diagnosed. ""And she said: 'OK, then I know what I want.'"" Anneke's brother Frank chips in: ""Maybe she hesitated for five seconds, and said: 'Now I know what to do.'"" They both knew she was referring to euthanasia. You could say Annie's story is a textbook case of how euthanasia is supposed to happen in the Netherlands - with very consistent and clear consent. But there are other cases where the patient's consent is less consistent, and at the final moment, less clear. Annie's story was featured in a film called Before It's Too Late by the Dutch director, Gerald van Bronkhorst. In the documentary viewers follow her journey through Alzheimer's, ending in her death by euthanasia at the age of 81.  They see a proud woman who brought up three children alone, who enjoyed mountain climbing and had a strong religious belief, laid low by dementia. ""I used to go climbing or skiing or whatever,"" says Annie in the film. ""In the village they said, 'That Annie, she's always on the go.' I'd put my rucksack on in the morning and start hiking. I'd walk all day. Now I can't do anything. I get confused all the time."" Annie wanted people to understand her decision, so she allowed the camera to film on the day she died.  She is shown sitting on the sofa, looking relaxed and positive. Her three children are with her, joking with the two doctors who've arrived to carry out the euthanasia about a special meal they had the previous night. ""We went to a three/four-star restaurant,"" Frank tells me later. ""I asked her, 'What do you want to do before you die?' We had a beautiful meal, laughed and cried. There was no tomorrow that evening. It was so special. ""But then you go home. It was very hard to get any sleep the night before."" Anneke describes finding a letter that her mother wrote that night. ""She wrote a letter to God, asking him to take care of her children. She knew that if there was a God it would be a really warm forgiving God."" Frank adds: ""She said, 'It's a pity I can't send an email back to my children to tell them what it's like.'"" The film shows the doctor taking great care to make sure that Annie is fully aware that she is choosing to die by euthanasia. He asks her several times if she is sure she knows what she is doing. ""You're sure you want to drink the mixture I'll give you?"" the doctor asks. ""You know it will put you to sleep and you won't wake up again?"" Annie says: ""I thought it through once again last night, from start to finish and back, and in the end this is what I want. Purely for myself. This is what's best for me."" She does not hesitate when she is handed a glass of clear liquid, containing a lethal dose of sedative. She drinks it, complaining only about the bitter taste. Her family is shown hugging her as she goes to sleep for the last time. ""She drank the cup,"" remembers Frank later. ""But it took a while."" ""The sleep was getting deeper and deeper,"" adds Anneke. ""It was very gentle."" But a couple of hours went by and Annie was still sleeping. This led to a surreal scene, described to me by Gerald van Bronkhorst, who was filming. ""She was asleep on the couch, and then she started snoring. And the family started to say: 'I'm hungry, shall we have a sandwich?' So we're all chewing around this lady, who's sleeping on the couch, and dying. But this shows how normal life takes over, even in a situation like this."" Worried that Annie might actually wake up, the doctors eventually gave her a lethal injection. ""It was 20 seconds, and then she was gone,"" says Frank. Frank and Anneke say they always supported their mother in her decision, despite any reservations they felt about it. ""It's hard to see your mother die from euthanasia, but it was not our decision - it was her decision,"" says Anneke. ""There is no right or wrong decision. It's hard to decide you want to die but it's as hard to decide, I think, that you want to live. She hated it when someone said: 'It's so brave that you made this decision.' She said choosing to live with dementia is just as brave."" Frank adds: ""A good friend of mine said, 'You have to stop your mother - as a son you have to stop her.' I said, 'No I'm not going to, I support her.' His mother said [to me], 'You're killing your mother, you're murdering your mother if you go on with this…' It's hard to hear."" Arguments like this are common among families and friends and reflect the wider debate which began in the Netherlands in the 1970s, when doctors first started carrying out so-called ""mercy killing"" fairly openly. The arguments continued in the run-up to the legalisation of euthanasia in 2002, and have never really stopped. The number of those opting for euthanasia has grown steadily, particularly in the past 10 years. In 2002, the Dutch authorities were notified of 1,882 cases; 15 years later the figure was 6,585. In order to satisfy the law on euthanasia, patients must convince a doctor that their decision is completely voluntary, that their life has become, or will become, one of ""unbearable suffering without prospect of improvement"", and that there is ""no reasonable alternative"". An independent assessment must then be made by another doctor. The first recorded case of a patient with dementia being given euthanasia came about in 2004, two years after the law changed. But euthanasia cases involving dementia patients almost always take place in the earlier stages of the disease, because it's hard to convince a doctor that the patient has the capacity to understand their decision to die in the later stages. In 2017, 166 early-stage dementia patients died by euthanasia, and only three with late-stage dementia. Despite this, medical ethicist Berna van Baarsen believes that a shift is under way and that in future there will be more. She used to sit on a committee that reviewed every case of euthanasia in one region of the Netherlands but resigned, saying that troubling cases were being approved too easily. ""I have seen the shift,"" she says. ""The problem is that the shift is very difficult to catch. But it is happening. It's happening under your nose, and in the end you realise there has been a shift."" She thinks there is an over-reliance on written declarations, or living wills, which patients who might want euthanasia often give to their doctor in the early stages of a disease. ""You can write down what your fears are. What you don't want to experience. But it is a wish. It is an expression of fear, and as we know, people change.   ""In the beginning they say: 'Oh no, I don't want to live in an old people's home.' Or, 'I don't want to be put in a wheelchair,' and it happens. People always find ways to cope. That's a beautiful thing about being human."" So she argues that before helping someone to die, doctors must always check that this is still the patient's wish. And with late-stage dementia patients, this is not always possible. ""If you can't talk to a patient, you don't know what the patient wants,"" she says. But if Berna van Baarsen is right that the pendulum has been swinging in favour of euthanasia for patients with late-stage dementia, the prosecution of a doctor involved in one such case may push it back in the opposite direction. The case involved a 74-year-old woman who had signed a written declaration saying she wanted euthanasia, but only when she said she was ready. And she had also said, at other times, that she did not want to die by euthanasia. The doctor, who worked in a nursing home, put a sedative into the woman's coffee without telling her. Then the woman woke up while the doctor attempted to give her a lethal injection. She had to be restrained by relatives while the euthanasia was completed, although the level of restraint used is disputed. Listen to the documentary Living and Dying with Alzheimer's on BBC Sounds Jacob Kohnstamm, co-ordinating chairman of the Dutch review committees, which examine every euthanasia case, says it is clear the doctor overstepped the mark. ""The commission said the written declaration wasn't good enough, and the doctor should have stopped the procedure the moment the patient got up,"" he says. The committee ruled that the doctor had not acted with due care, and referred the case to prosecutors.  The case will be watched closely when it comes to trial because it may help to clarify the circumstances when dementia patients can die by euthanasia. But while for many doctors this will be welcome, it is an unnerving prospect for those who are prepared to carry out euthanasia even on people with advanced dementia - such as Annie Zwijnenberg's doctor, Constance de Vries.  She is content to end the lives of patients who may find it difficult to express their wishes, as long as they were always very clear about their wishes when they could express them. It's important to have a long-term relationship with the patients and their families, she says, to enable her to talk to them about their written declaration, and observe over a long period of time an unwavering desire for euthanasia. She tells me about one such case. ""The lady was very unhappy; she was crying, and yelling, and not eating, and not sleeping, and aggressive to other people. When you saw her, you saw how unhappy she was. And she always had it in the statement: 'When I don't recognise my grandchildren any more, then I want to die.'"" As the moment when she could no longer recognise her grandchildren had arrived, Constance de Vries proceeded with euthanasia, with the support of the woman's family.  ""When I gave her a glass of fruit juice, I said, 'When you take it, you will sleep forever.' She looked at her daughter, and the daughter said, 'It's OK mum.' And she took it. I don't know if she did understand fully, but I know what we did was OK, so unhappy was she."" I ask her if the first prosecution of a doctor for ending a patient's life by euthanasia makes her worried about being involved in such cases? ""This is making me worried, yes,"" she says. ""I'm a little bit afraid of the judgement afterwards. So I try to be very, very, very sure about what I'm doing."" But does she have any intention of stopping? ""No,"" she says, adamantly. She does concede, though, that the case may make it harder for patients with late-stage dementia to get euthanasia in future. And if this happens, it could also have a knock-on effect for those with early-stage dementia who want euthanasia at some point in the future. Many of them already worry that if they wait too long they'll be denied it. The fear has become so commonplace that a shorthand phrase has been adopted for the perfect time to have euthanasia - ""five to midnight"". Just like Cinderella, everyone wants to wait until the last possible moment before they leave the party - until five to midnight - but many feel that it's too risky to leave it that long. It's the one regret Anneke and Frank express about the death of their mother, Annie. ""She was very afraid that even when she had the law on her side, or she had the doctors on her side that there would be a point that somebody would say: 'OK, but sorry you're too far gone now, you can't make this decision any more, so sorry you're too late,'"" Anneke says. Annie herself talks about it in Gerald van Bronkhorst's film, which alludes to her fear in its title, Before It's Too Late. ""Yesterday I spoke to a former neighbour on the phone,"" Annie says. ""She said, 'But I don't understand. You can still do everything can't you?' I said, 'Well the point is, first of all I can't. And second, if I wait until the moment has come to stop it'll be too late. I won't be allowed to do euthanasia any more.'"" Images from Before It's Too Late courtesy of Gerald van Bronkhorst In January 2018 a young Dutch woman drank poison supplied by a doctor and lay down to die. Euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide are legal in the Netherlands, so hers was a death sanctioned by the state. But Aurelia Brouwers was not terminally ill - she was allowed to end her life on account of her psychiatric illness.

1902,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47059079,"Scientists say they have designed a jelly-like pill that inflates to the size of a ping-pong ball when it reaches the stomach, and could be used to monitor tumours or ulcers. The soft, squishy device was inspired by the puffer fish, which inflates quickly like a balloon when threatened. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology team behind the pill says it can last for a month. The pill has been tested in pigs but not yet in humans. The pill is made from two types of hydrogels - an inner layer of absorbent particles and an outer protective membrane.  This gives it the consistency of jelly, helping it to expand quickly in the stomach and therefore stopping it from passing out the other end. The inflated pill could be removed at any time by drinking a solution of calcium that makes it quickly shrink to its original size, the scientists claim. It can then pass safely out of the body.  In the lab, researchers put the pill in solutions of water resembling gastric stomach juices and found it inflated to 100 times its original size in 15 minutes. But they also found it was strong enough to survive regular contractions in the stomach. The researchers say the pill is softer and lasts longer than current alternatives, which are often made of hard plastic or metal. When temperature sensors inside pills were fed to pigs - which have very similar stomachs and intestines to humans - the team was able to track the animals' daily activities for up to 30 days. ""The dream is to have a smart pill, that once swallowed stays in the stomach and monitors the patient's health for a long time, such as a month,"" says Xuanhe Zhao, associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. The researchers, whose work is reported in the journal Nature Communications, envisage putting various different sensors inside the puffer pills and delivering them to the stomach. These sensors could monitor signs of bacteria and viruses. In the long term, with tiny cameras inside them, the pills might also be used to check the progress of tumours or ulcers over several weeks, the research team said. And Prof Zhao said the pill could potentially be used as an alternative to the gastric balloon, which is inserted into the stomach to encourage weight loss.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47472472,"Public satisfaction with the NHS has fallen to its lowest level for over a decade, a long-running survey suggests.  The British Social Attitudes poll of nearly 3,000 people found 53% of in England, Scotland and Wales were satisfied with services last year. That is a three percentage point drop since 2017 and the lowest level since 2007. A peak of 70% was seen in 2010. Experts said waiting times and a lack of staff were major concerns as ratings for GPs dropped to an all-time low. The findings of the survey have been released by the Nuffield Trust and King's Fund think tanks, which helped to provide analysis around the figures. Ruth Robertson, from the King's Fund, said the issues identified by the public were ""long-standing"" problems that the government had not yet managed to deal with. She pointed out the findings were even more interesting considering the public had been polled in the summer after the 70th anniversary of the creation of the NHS and at a time when the government had announced extra funding for the health service. ""There was no birthday bounce,"" she added. If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here.  Of those who were not satisfied last year, 30% said they were actively dissatisfied, with virtually all the rest being neither satisfied or dissatisfied. Less than 1% said they could not answer. Being free at the point of use, the quality of care and the range of services and treatments available were the main reasons people expressed satisfaction. Despite the drop in satisfaction, the rating was still well above the all-time low of 34%, which was recorded in 1997. The survey started in 1983. The poll also provided breakdowns for individual services.  It showed satisfaction with GPs was at it lowest level ever, at 63%, but that was still higher than dentistry and accident and emergency. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, of the Royal College of GPs, said GPs always wanted to provide the best care they could, so it was ""disappointing"" to see the drop. ""We know that general practice is currently facing intense resource and workforce pressures and while GPs are working incredibly hard to combat these, we understand that many patients are still waiting too long to see their doctor - something we find just as frustrating,"" she added. There were some encouraging signs, however, that when people did get to access hospital care, they were happy - as satisfaction ratings for outpatient services hit their highest levels ever, at 70%. Meanwhile, satisfaction levels with social care, which is run by councils not the health service, were down, at 26%. Although researchers said significant numbers - about one in 10 - did not express an opinion, suggesting people did not use these services or did not know what they were. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health services, said: ""These findings show the inevitable consequence of starving the NHS of funding for the best part of a decade.  ""We should be under no illusions about the scale of the task we face to restore public confidence in the health service."" A spokeswoman for England's Department of Health and Social Care said the recently announced long-term plan coupled with the extra money would ""safeguard"" the future of the NHS. Meanwhile, a Welsh government spokesman said other polling there showed satisfaction in Wales was higher- but, he added, there was ""always more to be done"".",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47403437,"There is no reason to delay having another baby after a stillbirth, research in the Lancet suggests. Although women are often told to wait for a year before getting pregnant again, there is little evidence to back up this advice. This international study of 14,000 births found no increased risk of problems if conception happened earlier. A UK stillbirth expert said the findings were important and reassuring. About one in every 225 births in the UK ends in stillbirth, which is defined as the death of a baby after 24 weeks of pregnancy in the UK. However, in this study, a stillbirth is defined as a baby's death after 22 weeks' pregnancy. Stillbirth rates have been gradually reducing in the UK since 2000, and more sharply since 2015, but compared with many other European countries, improvements in the UK have been slow. In many countries there is limited guidance available on planning future pregnancies after stillbirth, the study says. Manchester University's Prof Alex Heazell, spokesman for Tommy's stillbirth charity and the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, said his message to women was ""not to worry"". ""As long as they get all the information about why their baby died, then the choice of when to have another baby is down to when they are psychologically ready."" He said there was no physiological reason to wait more than a year before trying for another baby.  ""Stress may exacerbate things and so waiting until that goes may be a reason for some to hold off,"" Prof Heazell said. The researchers looked at the birth records of 14,452 women who had previously had a stillbirth in Western Australia, Finland and Norway over 37 years. A total of 2% of those subsequent pregnancies ended in stillbirth, 18% were preterm births and 9% were babies born small for their age. The study found that those who conceived within 12 months of stillbirth were no more likely to have another stillbirth, or a preterm birth, than women who left two or more years between pregnancies,  Out of the births studied, 9,109 or 63% were conceived within 12 months of the stillbirth.  The study, led by Dr Annette Regan, from Curtin University in Australia, said the findings were useful for clinicians who give counselling after stillbirths. She said women who did not leave enough time to recover after a previous pregnancy could be at risk of ""poor nutritional status, which has been linked to increased risk of foetal growth restriction and birth defects"". But she said this may be less likely to occur after a pregnancy loss, such as stillbirth or miscarriage.   Commenting on the research, Mark A Klebanoff, from the Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital in the US, said there were other factors to consider. ""Rather than adhering to hard and fast rules, clinical recommendations should consider a woman's current health status, her current age in conjunction with her desires regarding child spacing and ultimate family size, and particularly following a loss, her emotional readiness to become pregnant again.""

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47409916,"A Canadian court has upheld the bulk of a decision that ordered three tobacco companies to pay billions in damages.   The judgment involves class action suits that were consolidated against Imperial Tobacco Canada, Rothmans Benson & Hedges and JTI-MacDonald.  The companies had appealed a 2015 ruling in favour that ordered them to pay over C$15bn (£8.5bn; $11bn). The plaintiffs were Quebec smokers who said the firms failed to warn them of health risks associated with smoking. Rothmans, Benson & Hedges said on Friday it will seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.  JTI-Macdonald Corp said it ""fundamentally disagrees"" with the decision and is considering all options, including an appeal.  Plaintiffs said the firms knew since the 1950s that their product was causing cancer and other illnesses and failed to warn consumers.  The companies had argued that Canadians have had a ""high awareness"" of smoking health risks for over half a century and say they have been strictly regulated.  The Quebec Court of Appeal sided on Friday with a lower court decision that concluded the companies had failed to provide adequate information about the ""safety defect"" in their tobacco products.  This is the largest award for damages in the country's history and will include interest on those damages.  The two class-action lawsuits were originally filed in 1998 before they were consolidated.  Smoking rates have reduced steadily in Canada over the years and in 2017 just under 17% of Canadians smoked at least occasionally.  In recent years, US courts have ordered tobacco companies to pay large awards.  But those payouts are often reduced upon appeal.  A $28 bn (£18.3 bn) ruling against Philip Morris was reduced to $28m on appeal in 2011. American tobacco firms agreed in 1998 to pay US states over $200 bn (£131 bn) in fines in what is the largest civil litigation suit in US history. US states have been criticised for not spending enough of the compensation on anti-smoking programmes.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-46265808,"Doctors and researchers have long been warning of alarmingly high Caesarean-section rates globally. Among countries with such high C-section rates, only one has managed to change - China. The story of how China succeeded where others failed is exemplary but also somewhat troubling. Less than a decade ago, China was criticised by the World Health Organization for having one of the highest Caesarean-section rates in the world. Things have changed very quickly.  China's C-section rate is still double that of Scandinavian countries and the rate is going up - but that rate of increase is slowing. And remarkably, researchers say, the numbers show China is on track to reverse its high C-section rates. ""China has managed to make a dent in C-section growth rates when other countries like Brazil have not managed to crack it,"" said Dr Susan Hellerstein, a Harvard University professor who co-wrote a study with Peking University researchers, analysing more than 100 million births in China.  Part of this success is down to serious investment in maternity care and the rise of ""wellness"" culture among the middle classes in Chinese cities - but the key factor here is the punitive element, which experts fear means women do not really have free choice when it comes to childbirth.   ""Why are you saying this now when you are having contractions? Your cervix has already dilated 4cm [1.5in]. A Caesarean is bad for you and the baby... you can't get one,"" a nurse is recorded telling a mother pleading for a C-section, in a 2016 study by University of Pennsylvania researcher Eileen Wang.  Nevertheless, many acknowledge that it's remarkable for a country that recorded 17.2 million live births in 2017 to effect such a shift - it has not been replicated elsewhere.    So, what's wrong with a Caesarean birth? In many situations, it is a life-saving procedure - but it is also risky and, as with any major surgery, recovery takes time. The World Health Organization cautions against it when not medically necessary. Some places, such as the Scandinavian nations, have always had low C-section rates and they remain low because this is the prevailing culture. The difficulty arises in those nations that have attained very high C-section rates, such as Brazil, and this has proven hard to shift. With China, however, researchers point to a reversal of trends virtually within a generation.    To explain this, experts have looked to all kinds of significant social shifts, from the rise of wellness culture to the impact of the one-child policy. But one factor sticks out as decisive: the power of the state.  China's health bureaucracy sprang into action in 2001, when the National Health and Family Planning Commission highlighted reducing C-section rates as a national priority in their 10-year plan, and in 2010 after a WHO paper showed the country's rate at 46%. There are now compulsory natural birth and breastfeeding classes, retraining for physicians to strengthen obstetrics skills and more midwifery training institutes.  But the most striking difference in China's approach compared with the rest of the world is just how strictly hospitals are held accountable for their Caesarean-section rates. ""Hospitals which offer delivery in a region are compared against each other and fines are issued if targets are not met,"" said Dr Liangkun Ma, senior obstetrician at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Other penalties include linking state subsidies with C-section rates and revoking hospital licences. In 2012, hospitals with high C-section rates in Hubei province were told they would be shut down and ""reformed"". The WHO's Dr Ana Pilar Betrán, who, studies interventions to reduce C-section rates globally, knows of no other country that penalises healthcare providers for high rates. The only other country with a similar policy is Portugal - but there, hospitals are rewarded for having lower rates.  Dr Betrán said setting ceiling rates and penalising healthcare providers was a ""dangerous"" path to take. ""A rate doesn't tell you if the women who need it are getting it,"" she said.  Even in countries where Caesarean rates are high, women are dying because they are not accessing this life-saving surgery. In Peru, Dr Betrán said, Caesarean rates among the richest women were about one in two but only 5% of women in the poorest segment of society delivered via C-section.  The changes in China's guidelines had taken choice in the childbirth process away from Chinese mothers, said Dr Carine Ronsmans, co-author of a study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in 2018. ""Part of government policy is something quite unique to China and is something we in the West would worry about - that is doctors are allowed to go against the will of the woman. In the legal guidelines, not just the clinical guidelines, doctors are told they can go against the woman's wishes,"" she said.  In one case that dominated local headlines last year, an expectant mother in labour, Ma Rongrong, jumped out of a hospital window to her death after she was refused a C-section. More recently, a man was detained for assaulting a medical professional after his wife was denied a C-section.  But it's not all about a climate of fear and refusal. The women of China's burgeoning middle class are part of this change as well and making positive choices, nudged by the state.   As soon as she had found out she was pregnant with her first child, Daisy Lan said, she had consumed information voraciously and concluded a natural birth would be better for her and baby. Her friends who had babies earlier, though, had made a different choice. ""Some feared labour pain so they chose a C-section. But things are different now,"" Ms Lan said.  ""Chinese mothers want better quality of life and this means a healthier life and greater awareness of what is good for them,"" said Dr Liangkun Ma. ""It's this same desire to live healthier that drives patients to actively seek information about childbirth through apps and WeChat groups, which raises awareness of the risks that come with C-sections,"" she said. Ms Lan said educating herself online about the options for easing pain during childbirth had helped her settle on natural birth - that and the possibility of a cleverer baby, a popular but obviously unproven claim made in Chinese parenting blogs.     Some hospitals now even provide more alternative therapies for mothers' pain relief, such as yoga, mindfulness and music. So, it's perhaps unsurprising that the phenomenon is most dramatic in China's super-cities, where mothers are turning away from the knife in large numbers, as the 2017 study of 100 million births in China published by the Journal of American Medical Association shows. But there are still wide gaps between urban and rural China. Improved facilities and costs have broadly seen C-section rates rise in rural regions - but in some areas rates remain so low, there is concern about lack of medical care access at birth for women in need. China's population, in cities and in rural areas, has been controlled for years, so it would be natural to consider one of China's biggest social shifts in recent years - the scrapping of its one-child policy -  as another possible factor affecting C-section rates. But the evidence for this is inconclusive.  Meanwhile, other changes to the law now mean patients don't need to just prove harm but also negligence and causation for a legal case to be credible. And this is crucial in a country where obstetricians run the highest risk of being sued for medical malpractice.   Whatever the reasons behind the change, Dr Betrán said this focus solely on C-section rates distracted from the ultimate goal of providing the best care for mother and child. Northern European countries, which had consistently kept C-section rates low, had not achieved that by employing policies specifically to keep rates down but by ensuring quality care, she said.  ""We should be careful not to lose perspective,"" she said. ""What happens when a woman needs or wants a Caesarean section [including] for psychological reasons and in this whole atmosphere of Caesarean-section focus, they don't get it?"" Ultimately, the real key to tackling the growth rate is to persuade more first-time mothers to have natural births, many argue, and the study in the BMJ suggests this might already be happening. China is certainly well ahead of the game for having implemented a multi-pronged approach to reducing the rates - but the difference is the punitive threat behind failure to comply.  Ms Lan was not forced into a natural birth but, she said, she had never truly had a choice. At 34, she had been an older first-time mother by Chinese standards, she said, and her peers who had given birth earlier had congratulated her for her bravery in undergoing a natural birth.  ""They were allowed to choose but now it is different,"" she said.",,,,

Simon Stevens said parents were seeing ""fake messages"" online about vaccines, which was making it harder to ""win the public argument"" on vaccination. NHS England is considering what action can be taken to stop such messages spreading, Mr Stevens said. He said the health service needed to support parents on the issue. Speaking at a health summit held by the Nuffield Trust think tank, Mr Stevens said that there had been a ""steady decline"" in the uptake of the measles vaccine over the last five years.  He went on to describe the uptake of the MMR vaccine among five-year-olds in England (87.5% compared with the World Health Organization target of 95%) as a ""real problem"". He said: ""Across the world, two to three million lives are saved each year by vaccination. ""But as part of the fake news movement, actually the vaccination deniers are getting some traction... ""We are not being helped on this front by the fact that although nine in 10 parents support vaccination, half of them say they have seen fake messages about vaccination on social media."" Mr Stevens said parents at his daughter's primary school have expressed concern about vaccines. ""This is probably not something I should be saying, but I'll anonymously read you one of the WhatsApp messages from one of the parents. ""'My kids aren't vulnerable and I think loading up on vaccines blocks their systems from fighting disease as it should do'."" ""We have a responsibility for the nine out of 10 to really explain it's not just of interest for your own children but herd immunity for other children as well."" In January, the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) warned that social media is helping to spread ""misleading and dangerous information"" about vaccines. Experts called for more to be done to challenge untruths about possible side effects of vaccines and said that social media giants should clamp down on ""fake news"". The study said social media is a ""breeding ground for misleading information and negative messaging around vaccination"".  Mr Stevens added: ""Frankly it's as irresponsible to tell parents that their children shouldn't be vaccinated as it is to say don't bother - to your kids on their way to primary school - to look both ways when they cross the road. ""As a health service we've really got to help support parents on this.""",,,,

It follows a British Medical Association campaign pointing out many hospitals supply razors and shaving foam to men, but no sanitary products. NHS England said it was ""absolutely right"" that women had access to daily essentials while in hospital. The charity Freedom4Girls said tampons must be ""readily available everywhere"". In February, the BMA said two in every five UK hospital trusts and health boards did not give sanitary products to patients who needed them, or only in emergencies. And at 27 trusts, there was nowhere to buy sanitary products anywhere on site. NHS England's Chief Executive Simon Stevens said on Sunday: ""It's fundamental that we give patients the best experience possible during what can be a stressful time of their life, and by providing sanitary products the NHS can prevent unnecessary embarrassment and leave people to focus on their recovery."" While some hospitals already provide sanitary products, NHS England said it would now be mandated in the new standard contract with hospitals for 2019-20. Dame Parveen Kumar, chair of the BMA's board of science, welcomed the move which she said would come as a relief for many patients.  She said BMA research had shown how ""patchy or non-existent"" the provision was, as well as the ""relatively small cost"" of providing tampons and sanitary pads free of charge. Tina Leslie from the charity Freedom4Girls, which campaigns against period poverty, said it was a ""fantastic step forward"". But she added: ""They need to be readily available everywhere where people who menstruate can actually get hold of them, whether they're either caught short or whether they can't afford them.  ""Period poverty is really widespread in the UK as well as the rest of the world."" The BMA is pressing for the move to apply to hospitals across the whole of the UK, although progress outside of England is already under way. In Scotland, free sanitary products are available in schools, colleges and universities, and a pilot to provide free products to low income households in Aberdeen is being rolled out. In Wales, a £1m government fund will help distribute free sanitary products via community groups, schools and food banks to those most in need, and in Derry, Northern Ireland, some public buildings are offering products free of charge.",,,,

The paint used contains the toxic metal cadmium which is associated with a risk of damage to kidneys and bones and may lead to cancer, according to the NHS. However, provided safety standards are met, the use of paint containing cadmium is permitted on glassware. In the withdrawn Amazon glasses cadmium was found close to the rim where the risk of ingesting it was highest. Dr Andrew Turner of the University of Plymouth analysed the decorated children's tumblers and said he would personally not wish to use them on a long term basis. Amazon said in a statement that ""all sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don't will be subject to action including potential removal of their account"". The Amazon glasses were produced under license from Disney by a company called Half Moon Bay which said it was ""investigating this product and its manufacture in light of the reported findings of Plymouth University"".   Dr Turner said: ""I would refrain from giving these to young children and I think I would refrain from using them myself as well."" Other glasses sold by Tesco and Plymouth-based The Range were found to have paint containing lead and cadmium, but the paint was further away from the rim, where the risk was deemed to be lower. Dr Turner, who has tested a wide range of painted glasses, said: ""We get these two chemicals in most of the glassware that we test."" Tesco said all of its drinking glasses complied with EU and UK safety standards and those examined by Dr Turner had also been independently tested ""to show compliance"" with a voluntary standard on lead and cadmium. Neither of these substances are banned from being used in paint on glassware. Rayware, which supplies the glasses tested from The Range, said the glasses passed EU and UK safety standards. The Range said it had removed the product from sale as a precaution while further investigations were carried out.  Expert Dr Caroline Taylor from the University of Bristol said ingesting lead could lead to behavioural problems and lower IQs in children. ""I feel that there's no need for this kind of paint to be on glasses so why are we taking unnecessary risks,"" she said. The FSA said in a statement that anyone who suspected ""something deficient with their glassware"" could report it to Trading Standards at their local authority or Citizen's Advice. Trading Standards would then investigate and report any concerns to the FSA. You can see more on this story on BBC Inside out South West on BBC One, Monday 4 March at 19:30 GMT.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47445785,"The government has launched its first cervical screening advertising campaign in England, as the number of women having checks has hit a 20-year low. The campaign - being run by Public Health England - has avoided the term ""smear test"" amid concern it may be putting people off. Officials said the term was outdated and hope the term cervical screening will ""normalise"" the procedure. Adverts will run on TV, radio and online for the next eight weeks. The campaign stresses the screening is basically a health check for the cervix and shows a woman being reminded by family members and friends to go for testing. Figures last year showed just over 71% of women aged 25 to 64 had been screened at regular enough intervals. PHE director of screening Anne Mackie said the campaign was about ""breaking down barriers"". She said there were a variety of reasons for not attending but there had been a conscious move away from the term ""smear test"".  ""The technical process used today no longer smears the sample of cells from the cervix on to a glass plate,"" she said. ""We now put cells that we collect into a tube of liquid, so technically 'smear' is incorrect."" Ms Mackie said the overarching message of the campaign - cervical screening saves lives - was much more ""clear and direct"" and ""hopefully helps to normalise the term"". She added: ""The campaign shows how cervical screening is a vital preventative test which can identify potentially harmful cells and treat them before they have a chance to develop into cancer, giving us the opportunity to stop cancer before it starts."" Masters student Isha Webber, 29, from London, attended her first screening appointment when she was 25. It came back all clear. A few years later, when she was screened again, she was found to have abnormal cells that required treatment to remove.  ""I can't reinforce enough how important it is to stay on top of your cervical screening appointments,"" she said. ""When you get your invitation letter, book right away and don't delay.  ""I am so glad that I went when I did and had those abnormal cells removed.  ""I hate to think what may have been the case if I delayed.  ""I now talk to as many people as possible about my experience, to raise awareness of the importance of screening."" The NHS target is for 80% of women aged 25 to 49 to be tested every three years and the same proportion aged 50 to 64 to be screened every five years. But in some areas uptake has dropped below 50%. Experts have put it down to: Research by the charity Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust suggested young women were embarrassed to attend because of: A third said they would not go if they had not waxed or shaved their bikini area. And about 15% said they would miss their screening test for a gym class or a waxing appointment. Every year about 2,600 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and nearly 700 die from the disease. The advertising campaign is just one element of the government's approach to increase uptake. A review of invitation letters, leaflets and results letters is under way, while pilots to trial text messaging reminders have started. Some areas have also started to offer weekend and evening screening. Government advisers are also considering whether to recommend self-testing. Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust chief executive Robert Music said: ""We know attending screening isn't always easy for a wide range of reasons, yet cervical screening can be lifesaving as it can detect changes in the cervix before they become cancerous."" The Scottish government and NHS Scotland ran a cervical screening advert in 2017, telling women to ""stop fannying about"" and ""nip cancer in the bud"". While it used the term smear test, the NHS Health Scotland website primarily refers to it as cervical screening.

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47440622,"Your heart can be damaged after a sad event and it may be your brain's doing, experts believe. Swiss researchers have been studying people with a rare and unusual condition called broken heart syndrome.  This weakening and failing of the heart happens suddenly, often after a stressful or emotional event such as bereavement.  It is little understood but the work in the European Heart Journal suggests the mind's response to stress plays a part. Also known as takotsubo syndrome - referring to the shape of the heart in people with this condition, which resembles a Japanese pot with the same name - broken heart syndrome can be brought on by shock.  It's different from a heart attack caused by blocked blood vessels, but has similar symptoms, including breathlessness and chest pain.  Often, an unhappy event is the trigger, but exciting big events, such as a wedding or new job, have been linked with it too.  Some people won't have, or be able to identify, a specific event that caused the condition. It can be temporary, with the heart muscle recovering over days, weeks or months, but for some it can be deadly. It is thought to affect around 2,500 people every year in the UK. The exact cause is not known, but experts believe it could be linked to raised levels of stress hormones, such as adrenaline.  Dr Jelena Ghadri and colleagues at University Hospital Zurich looked at what was happening in the brains of 15 patients with broken heart syndrome. Brain scans showed up noticeable differences compared with scans from 39 healthy, control patients. There was less communication between brain regions involved with controlling emotions and unconscious or automatic body responses, such as heartbeat. These brain areas are the ones that are thought to control our response to stress. Dr Ghadri said: ""Emotions are processed in the brain so it is conceivable that the disease originates in the brain with top-down influences on the heart."" The exact pathway is still not completely understood, so more work is needed. Scans of the patients' brains before or at the time they developed broken heart syndrome were not available, so the researchers cannot say whether the decreased communication between brain regions caused the takotsubo syndrome or vice versa.  Joel Rose, chief executive of Cardiomyopathy UK, said: ""This is an important piece of research that will help to shape our understanding of a form of cardiomyopathy that is often overlooked and remains something of an enigma.  ""The people with takotsubo cardiomyopathy that we support will certainly welcome this new effort to understand the role that the brain plays in this condition and why some people are more susceptible than others. We hope that this research will lead to further focus in this area and greater collaboration between neuroscientists and cardiologists."" British Heart Foundation-funded researcher Prof Dana Dawson, from the University of Aberdeen, said: ""These findings support something we have long suspected - that there is a brain-heart interaction in takotsubo.""",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47421855,"A UK patient's HIV has become ""undetectable"" following a stem cell transplant - in only the second case of its kind, doctors report in Nature. The London patient, who was being treated for cancer, has now been in remission from HIV for 18 months and is no longer taking HIV drugs. The researchers say it is too early to say the patient is ""cured"" of HIV. Experts say the approach is not practical for treating most people with HIV but may one day help find a cure. The male London patient, who has not been named, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2012.  He had chemotherapy to treat the Hodgkin's cancer and, in addition, stem cells were implanted into the patient from a donor resistant to HIV, leading to both his cancer and HIV going into remission. Researchers from University College London, Imperial College London, Cambridge and Oxford Universities were all involved in the case. This is the second time a patient treated this way has ended up in remission from HIV. Ten years ago, another patient in Berlin received a bone-marrow transplant from a donor with natural immunity to the virus. Timothy Brown, said to be the first person to ""beat"" HIV/Aids, was given two transplants and total body irradiation (radiotherapy) for leukaemia - a much more aggressive treatment. ""By achieving remission in a second patient using a similar approach, we have shown that the Berlin patient was not an anomaly and that it really was the treatment approaches that eliminated HIV in these two people,"" said lead study author Prof Ravindra Gupta, from UCL. By BBC Online Health Editor, Michelle Roberts Although the finding is exciting, it is not offering up a new treatment for the millions of people around the world living with HIV. The aggressive therapy was primarily used to treat the patient's cancer, not his HIV.  Current HIV therapies are really effective, meaning people with the virus can live long and healthy lives.  But the reason this case is so significant is that it could help experts who are looking for new ways to tackle HIV and achieve a cure.  Understanding how the body can naturally resist the infection does offer up hope of this, even if it is still a long way off. Prof Eduardo Olavarria, also involved in the research, from Imperial College London, said the success of stem cell transplantation offered hope that new strategies could be developed to tackle the virus.  But he added: ""The treatment is not appropriate as a standard HIV treatment because of the toxicity of chemotherapy, which in this case was required to treat the lymphoma."" CCR5 is the most commonly used receptor by HIV-1 - the virus strain of HIV that dominates around the world - to enter cells. But a very small number of people who are resistant to HIV have two mutated copies of the CCR5 receptor. This means the virus cannot penetrate cells in the body that it normally infects. The London patient received stem cells from a donor with this specific genetic mutation, which made him resistant to HIV as well. But a reservoir of cells carrying HIV can still remain in the body, in a resting state, for many years. The UK researchers say it may be possible to use gene therapy to target the CCR5 receptor in people with HIV, now they know the Berlin patient's recovery was not a one-off. Prof Graham Cooke, National Institute for Health Research research professor and reader in infectious diseases from Imperial College London, said the results were ""encouraging"". ""If we can understand better why the procedure works in some patients and not others, we will be closer to our ultimate goal of curing HIV.  ""At the moment the procedure still carries too much risk to be used in patients who are otherwise well."" Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases and honorary consultant physician at Cardiff University, said it was an ""interesting and potentially significant report"".  But he said much longer follow-up would be needed to ensure the virus did not re-emerge at a later stage. ""While this type of treatment is clearly not practical to treat the millions of people around the world living with HIV, reports such as these may help in the ultimate development of a cure for HIV."" In the meantime, he said the focus needed to be on diagnosing HIV promptly and starting patients on lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). This can prevent the virus being transmitted to others and give people with HIV a near-normal life expectancy.",,,,

Owners are at particular risk if they let their pet lick them after it has eaten raw bone, meat or offal, they say in Vet Record. The diets are becoming increasingly popular, touted by some as offering pets a health boost and a glossy coat.  The researchers studied 60 raw samples from 10 manufacturers from Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany and England. Unlike commercial feeds, raw-meat products are not heat-treated or freeze-dried to pasteurise their content and eliminate bacteria.  All 60 samples contained Enterobacteriaceae species, which are indicators of faecal contamination. Levels varied widely among the different manufacturers and, in some cases, among the different products from the same manufacturer. But 31 (52%) of the samples contained levels that exceeded the maximum threshold set by European Union regulations, of 5,000 bacteria per gram. Most of the species found are not known to cause infection, apart from E. coli, which was seen in about a third of the samples. Salmonella bacteria, banned under the EU regulations, were found in four samples. Campylobacter was found in three. Both are capable of passing from animals to people and causing infections. Daniella Dos Santos, from the British Veterinary Association, said: ""Pet owners who choose to feed a raw food diet should be aware of the potential health risks and take full precautions while storing and handling the food.

The screening is basically a health check for the cervix. But there's no doubt it has a bad reputation - and the word ""smear"" doesn't exactly sell the procedure. Whether you're worried it'll hurt or be embarrassing, we asked Dr Philippa Kaye about how you can make your test easier - because it does save lives. ""The best time to have your smear test is when you're not bleeding,"" says Dr Kaye, as that can affect the test.  ""Ideally, you would arrange it for somewhere in the middle of your cycle or towards the end of your cycle."" Dr Kaye adds the test itself might cause some pain similar to menstrual cramps, ""but that lasts maximum 30 seconds, and then it's gone"". The doctor or nurse taking the test needs you to be relaxed when taking the test - so make sure you're comfortable. ""Maybe you want to wear a skirt, so that we can lift that up and you still feel more covered - as opposed to taking off leggings or jeans,"" says Dr Kaye. If you're more comfortable with a female doctor or nurse doing the test, you can ask for one. ""I can't guarantee that that is always available, but in the majority of GP services it is,"" says Dr Kaye. The speculum is the clear plastic instrument which is inserted into the vagina to hold it open. It shouldn't need to be warmed up at all. ""If you can tolerate sex or a sex toy, most people will be able to tolerate a speculum,"" explains Dr Kaye. But if it is painful, then your doctor or nurse can use a smaller one. ""In my experience that's never happened to me - if somebody wanted to try, I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with it,"" says Dr Kaye.  ""It might need a slight change in positioning - but I would be willing to talk about it and try."" There is talk of a self-sampling test coming in, which would just involve putting a swab in the vagina.  ""I think it is something we are going to do in the future and will encourage more women to screen."" If you feel pain or discomfort, tell the doctor or nurse doing the test. ""Most women do it on their backs, with their legs up in a diamond shape, but we could do it lying on your side,"" says Dr Kaye. ""Slow your breathing down, put your hands by your side, and think about dropping your bottom into the couch. ""We might ask you to put your hands underneath your bottom, or we might ask you to cough."" That can help the speculum be inserted easier. ""It's important that you don't use spermicide or lots of lubricants in the 24 hours before the test, because it can interfere with the test itself,"" says Dr Kaye. But if you're uncomfortable, the doctor or nurse may put a small amount of lube on the speculum before inserting it. Painkillers are not generally required, but ""if you were really worried and think it would help, you could take paracetamol or ibuprofen before,"" says Dr Kaye. ""If you feel that would help you, then there's no harm, in doing that."" Save the alcohol for after the test. ""I want women to be empowered - to be as relaxed and able to have their smear test as possible.  ""That might mean bringing a friend, or having a reward or treat afterwards - whatever helps you get by."" But, ""if you are drunk, then you are unable to have true consent to have the test."" That means it's very unlikely your healthcare professional will allow you to have it.  ""People always apologise to me that they haven't waxed,"" says Dr Kaye. ""They're worried about their smell, they're worried about their pubic hair or leg hair. ""The truth is, your healthcare professional is not thinking about that.

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47371078,"Around the world, people are living longer.  In 1950, global average life expectancy at birth was only 46. By 2015, it had shot up to over 71.  In some countries, progress has not always been smooth. Disease, epidemics and unexpected events are a reminder that ever-longer lives are not a given.  Meanwhile, the deaths that may preoccupy us - from terrorism, war and natural disasters - make up less than 0.5% of all deaths combined.  But across the world, many are still dying too young and from preventable causes.     The story of when people die is really a story of how they die, and how this has changed over time.  About 56 million people in the world died in 2017.  This is 10 million more than in 1990, as the global population has increased and people live longer on average. More than 70% die from non-communicable, chronic diseases. These are not passed from person to person and typically progress slowly.  The biggest single killer is cardiovascular disease, which affects the heart and arteries and is responsible for every third death.  This is twice the rate of cancers - the second leading cause - which account for about one in six of all deaths.  Other non-contagious diseases such as diabetes, certain respiratory diseases and dementia are also near the top of the list. What may be more shocking is the number of people who still die from preventable causes.  About 1.6 million died from diseases related to diarrhoea in 2017, putting it in the top 10 causes of death. In some countries, it's one of the largest killers. Neonatal disorders  - the death of a baby within the first 28 days - claimed 1.8 million newborns in 2017.  The frequency of these deaths varies greatly from country to country. In Japan, fewer than one in 1,000 babies die in the first 28 days of life, compared with just under one in 20 in some of the world's poorest countries. Other preventable deaths are high up the list. Road accidents incur a high death toll in the richest and poorest countries alike, claiming 1.2 million lives in 2017.  While many high-income countries have seen significant falls in road deaths in recent decades, globally the number dying on the roads has almost stayed the same. Meanwhile, almost twice as many people around the world died from suicide as from homicide - the killing of one person by another.  In the UK, suicide deaths were 16 times higher; it is the leading cause of death for men aged 20-40. What people die from changes over time and as their country develops.  In the past, infectious diseases played a bigger part than they do today.  In 1990, one in three deaths resulted from communicable and infectious diseases; by 2017 this had fallen to one in five. Children are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. As recently as the 19th Century, every third child in the world died before the age of five. Child mortality rates have fallen significantly since then thanks to vaccines and improvements in hygiene, nutrition, healthcare and clean water access. Child deaths in rich countries are now relatively rare, while the poorest regions today have child mortality rates similar to the UK and Sweden in the first half of the 20th Century, and are continuing to catch up. The decline in global child deaths is one of the greatest success stories of modern healthcare. The number of children dying each year has more than halved in recent decades, as we have got better at fighting contagious and infectious diseases.  This has shifted death rates towards non-contagious diseases in elderly people. Many countries have growing concerns about the increasing burden on relatives and healthcare systems as people get older and have longer-term illnesses.  More stories like this Unexpected events can throw this steady improvement off course. The 1980s HIV/Aids crisis is a striking example of this. The epidemic was felt across all regions of the world, but the most notable impact on life expectancy was in sub-Saharan Africa.  After decades of steady improvement, life expectancy fell substantially across many countries in the region. A combination of anti-retroviral therapy, treatment and education on prevention means global deaths from Aids-related illness have halved in the last decade alone - from 2 million per year down to 1 million.  Life expectancy has since began to recover in these countries, but is only now returning to pre-crisis levels.  Even in the richest countries, continued progress is not a given.  Life expectancy in the US has fallen slightly over the past few years, largely as a result of the opioid drug crisis.  Life expectancy for new mothers has also not consistently increased.  There are about 10 countries where a young woman today would be more likely to die during or shortly after childbirth than her mother was, including the US.  Today's overall picture is positive: we are living longer lives while fewer people - especially children - are dying from preventable causes. But it's also true that we still have a long way to go.  Further improvements in sanitation, hygiene, nutrition, vaccination and basic healthcare are all crucial to this.  So too are increased safety measures and mental health provision. Understanding what people die from is crucial if we want this recent progress to continue.

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47462762,"Hospitals are likely to experience delays to cancer testing and treatment regardless of the result of next week's Brexit vote, BBC Newsnight has learned. The Royal College of Radiologists has told doctors to prepare for possible delays for some drugs used to detect cancer if there is a no-deal Brexit. It says clinicians should reduce their workload in the days after 29 March, when the UK is due to leave the EU. The government said it had ""robust"" plans for however the UK leaves the EU. MPs will vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement by 12 March. If Parliament does not vote in favour of her deal and there is no extension of Article 50 - the two-year process for leaving the EU - the UK will leave with no withdrawal agreement, known as a no-deal Brexit. The five-page guidance to doctors from the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR), seen by Newsnight, warns that some radiopharmaceutical suppliers ""anticipate there may be some delay to their delivery times"".  It advises clinicians to: ""Keep [your] workload lighter for the first week following a no-deal Brexit, in order to see more clearly what the impact is likely to be."" It adds: ""In the weeks leading up to Brexit you should consider how to prioritise requests based on clinical need, should supplies be compromised."" The guidance refers to the radioisotopes commonly used in the diagnosis and treatment of some cancers.  These cannot be stockpiled in advance because of the rapid decay of their radioactivity and ""a one-day delay to delivery would reduce available activity by approximately 20%"", according to the guidance from the RCR.  A spokesman for the RCR told Newsnight the organisation now believed it was ""inevitable"" that uncertainty over Brexit would cause delays to some cancer tests and treatments. Dr Richard Graham said: ""Of course, now there will inevitably be delays to treatment as a result of the Brexit process because we need to start booking our lists for the post-Brexit date.  ""We will need to book clinics less heavily so that we've got more wriggle room if we don't have the radioisotopes in order to diagnose and treat the patients."" Dr Graham said the RCR had met with the Department of Health and Social Care several months ago ""when they were very optimistic that there would be a deal"" and that the guidance would not be necessary. ""But unfortunately now it looks like no deal really is a tangible possibility, so it's vital that we get this guidance out now so patients treatment and diagnosis is disrupted at the bare minimum."" Dr Graham said it would have been ""much easier"" for medics if they had known that a no-deal Brexit was not going to happen. ""But of course we understand that might be a negotiating strategy to get the best deal for the country.  ""Putting patients' health at risk for the sake of getting a good Brexit deal is a difficult priority to balance."" The Department of Health and Social Care has asked radiopharmaceutical suppliers to use air freight in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as that is expected to cause road disruption.  But the guidance states that ""some companies feel their plans will ensure no delays but others anticipate there may be some delay to their delivery times"". And on one specific type of treatment, known as radionuclide therapy, it states that ""only one supplier has been confident it will be able to deliver therapy doses on particular required days"".  The radiologists' warning that it is now too late to escape some disruption - even if Mrs May secures majority Parliamentary support for her withdrawal agreement - follows similar statements from other sectors.  UK-based financial firms have already had to establish offices elsewhere in the EU in case they suddenly find themselves unable to service European clients from 29 March.  And surveys show that stockpiling by manufacturing firms is at the highest level on record due to the fear of a no-deal Brexit. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Leaving the EU with a deal remains the government's top priority. ""As a responsible government we have robust contingency plans in place so patients can continue to have access to medicines, including medical radioisotopes, whatever the EU Exit outcome. ""We have worked with the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that planes are contracted to bring in medical radioisotopes under the appropriate specialist conditions and suppliers are working closely with the NHS to minimise any potential impact of changes to delivery times.""",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-47304678,"A stranger once waved at Boo James on a bus. She did not think any more of it - until it later emerged it was her mother. She has a relatively rare condition called face blindness, which means she cannot recognise the faces of her family, friends, or even herself.  Scientists have now launched a study they hope could help train people like Boo to recognise people better.   Boo said for many years she thought she was ""from another planet"".  ""It is immensely stressful and very emotionally upsetting to sit and dwell upon so I try not to do that,"" she said.  ""It's very hard work. It can be physically and emotionally exhausting to spend a day out in public constantly wondering whether you should have spoken to someone."" For most of her life, she didn't know she had the condition - also known as prosopagnosia - and blamed herself for the ""social awkwardness"" caused when she failed to recognise people.  ""I had to try and find a way to explain that. I really couldn't very well, except to think that I was just the one to blame for not being bothered to remember who people were. ""[Like it was] some sort of laziness: I didn't want to know them, obviously I wasn't interested enough to remember them, so that was some kind of deficiency, perhaps, in me."" But the penny dropped in her early 40s when she saw a news item about the condition on television.  ""I then knew that the only reason I wasn't recognising that person was because my brain physically wasn't able to do it,"" she said.  ""I could immediately engage more self-understanding and forgive myself and try to approach things from a different angle."" She said her childhood was punctuated by ""traumatic experiences"" with fellow children, childminders and teachers she could not recognise.  And even now, the 51-year-old, of Loughor, Swansea, said she struggles to recognise her family and long-term friends, including failing to recognise her father while meeting him during a holiday. But she also finds it very difficult to recognise someone even more fundamental. ""Recently, my mother said she'd found some old photos on her computer, so we were looking at them on screen,"" she said.  ""She was talking about one person in a picture and I said 'OK, but who on earth is that other person?' She said, 'well, that's you!'"" Boo describes her partner, Dewi, as her ""seeing dog for the face blind"" because he will try to discreetly tell her if someone they're talking to is someone she knows.  He is also on hand to explain the plot and identify characters in films, which would be otherwise ""impossible "" for her to follow.  ""He's very kind and very patient and he perseveres. Just occasionally we switch a film off because it just gets too complicated,"" she said.  But how do people with prosopagnosia perceive faces? Those with the condition say it can be difficult to describe.  ""I can see component parts of a face,"" Boo said. ""I can see there's a nose, I can see there are eyes and a mouth and ears.  ""But it's very difficult for my brain to hold them all together as the image of a face."" She now works from home as a writer and says the condition has impacted on her career, making her time in retail and as a receptionist ""very awkward"". ""People come in and see you regularly, and they know you but you're looking at them and you're not sure about your history with these people,"" she said.  However, despite the limitations, Boo believes she has developed tactics and techniques which allow her to often figure out who's who.  ""I do have a whole other palette I can use: hairstyles; a piece of jewellery someone might wear regularly; the way that someone dresses; people's voices, once they start talking; even the silhouette of someone, their body shape, the way that people talk.  ""I'd like to think I'm better at recognising people from behind than your average person,"" she explained.  It is believed up to one in 50 people have some form of developmental face blindness, although not as all profoundly as Boo.  Richard Warr, from Cardiff, a marketing lecturer at the University of Gloucestershire, has prosopagnosia to a much less severe degree.   He said: ""It's mainly with people that I don't know that well, so people I have maybe met very briefly or for people I've only know for a few days or a few weeks."" He added: ""Overall, it's not something that majorly impacts on my life, but it's something that's there and I do need to deal with quite often. ""Especially with new students coming in or meeting new people."" Academics carrying out the new research at Swansea University want people to come forward who may have experienced difficulty in recognising faces, as many have no idea they have prosopagnosia.  ""This is the kind of person who maybe finds films a little bit difficult to follow,"" said Swansea University psychologist, Dr John Towler. ""Maybe they were watching Game of Thrones and everyone's got long hair and beards and they've got no idea what's going on. ""It's only through raising awareness for prosopagnosia that people are starting to realise 'maybe that's me'."" There are two kinds of prosopagnosia.  Acquired prosopagnosia is a result of brain damage from injury to parts of the brain that control facial recognition, while developmental prosopagnosia, which affects those with face blindness from birth, arises from a breakdown in communication between different parts of the brain.  Dr Jodie Davies-Thompson, who is also part of the research team, said: ""If we can really work out exactly which part of the brain is going wrong, then we can start to look at remediation of this problem.  ""We're working here at Swansea at developing a rehabilitation programme for people with prosopagnosia.  ""We're hoping that will increase the connections between the areas and therefore increase their ability to recognise faces."" Support group, Face Blind UK, said the experiences of people like Boo and Richard were not uncommon and greater awareness really helped.  ""If other people are aware of the difficulties then they can begin to understand, and even offer help,"" spokeswoman, Hazel Plastow, said.",,,,

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47456418,"Consuming 850 calories a day for three months and then keeping the weight off can arrest type-2 diabetes for at least two years, a study suggests. The GP-led programme worked for more than a third of participating patients.  The study report builds on earlier work suggesting weight loss is one key solution and offers more time off medication than previously thought.  Experts say it challenges the view that type-2 diabetes is always a life-long, progressive condition.  Type-2 diabetes affects one in 16 adults in the UK.  It causes uncontrolled sugar levels that can lead to serious complications such as amputations, visual problems and heart disease.  Joe McSorley, 58, who lives near Glasgow, was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes six years ago and though he was given two types of medication, found it hard to keep his blood sugars under control.  He told BBC news: ""All I could see for the future was continuing to take these pills forever."" When he started the trial diet - consuming only low-calorie shakes every day - he found it very difficult.   But he saw rapid results, dropping from 90kg (14st 2lb) to 73kg in just 12 weeks.  And, Mr McSorley said, the hardest part came when he had begun to eat solid food again.  ""Using the shakes is only the start of the journey,"" he said.  ""It gets you to the point where you can take destiny in your own hands."" Two years later, his weight is stable at 77kg.  He exercises regularly and hopes to become a lifestyle coach when he retires.  Mr McSorley was one of 149 people in Scotland and Tyneside put on a 12-30-week low-calorie diet of shakes and drinks to help trigger weight loss.  They were then reintroduced to solid meals over the next few weeks.  After one year, 69 of them (46%) had gone into remission, compared with just 4% of people given standard treatment including pills.  And after two years, 53 of them (36%) remained off medication and in remission.  Participants were encouraged to keep healthy through monthly meetings and had the option of a ""rescue"" plan including using the liquid diet again, if they gained weight.  Prof Roy Taylor, an investigator on the trial at Newcastle University, said: ""These results are a significant development and finally pull down the curtain on the era of type-2 diabetes as an inevitably progressive disease."" Researchers said most of the weight-loss group whose diabetes had gone into remission had lost 10kg or more and maintained this weight loss during the trial.  But Dr Nicola Guess, at  King's College London, said weight loss was not the whole story.  ""Type-2 diabetes returned in a minority of people (16%) who kept off 15kg or more for two years,"" she said. ""Further research is needed to help us understand why this is.   ""It is possible that these people had type-2 diabetes for longer before losing weight or perhaps there might be dietary or genetic factors which contributed."" The NHS in England is planning on piloting the programme and NHS Scotland has begun rolling out similar schemes. But NHS experts caution that this type of calorie restriction is not be suitable for everyone and should be done under medical supervision only.  The charity Diabetes UK, which funded the study, said the findings were exciting but added: ""We know type-2 diabetes is a complex condition and this approach will not work for everyone."" The trial is published in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47474276,"The US drugs regulator has approved the sale of a new nasal spray to treat depression. Manufacturer Janssen says Esketamine can lift a patient's mood within 24 hours of use. The drug is intended for patients who have not responded to two other, conventional antidepressants which can take weeks to have an effect. But critics argue that the spray - sold as Spravato - may have been approved without adequate testing.  The spray was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s advisory panel in February, and can cost up to $885 (£673) per treatment. In a statement, Janssen said it offers ""a potential therapy for adults living with treatment-resistant depression,"" including help with tackling suicidal thoughts. Traditional antidepressants like Prozac try to ease depression by making more serotonin available in the brain to pass messages between nerve cells. Serotonin is thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. In contrast, esketamine targets glutamate, a chemical linked with learning and memory, and generally considered the most essential for normal brain function. The spray is absorbed through the nose into the blood stream and must be taken along with another, oral, anti-depressant. ""I have no doubt in my mind that this is a very useful treatment,"" Gerard Sanacora, a psychiatrist and the director of the Yale Depression Research Program, told health news publication Stat. ""[But this] has to be balanced with, how do we use this rationally, and in what step in care do we use this medicine."" The drug will come with a ""boxed warning"" that it may cause suicidal thoughts and dissociation, a sense of detachment from one's memory and sense of identity. As a result, patients must be monitored for at least two hours every time they take Spravato. Some panel members have publicly raised concerns about these side-effects and a shortage of long-term data on its health effects. ""The threshold has been two adequate and well-controlled trials. In this case, they only got one,"" Dr Erick Turner, a former FDA reviewer and professor at Oregon Health and Science University, told Stat. Others have raised concerns about the risk of abuse, due to the drug's links with ketamine. Ketamine is used in medicine to numb the body or induce sleep, and sometimes prescribed for depression. But the drug also has a reputation for recreational misuse. About 300 million people suffer from depression worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. The UN body said depression-related suicide was the second-leading cause of death among people aged 15-29 around the world.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47471142,"GPs are urging women not to be alarmed by research linking long-term hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use with a small increased risk of Alzheimer's. They say HRT is an effective and safe treatment for most women with menopause symptoms and the risk is ""extremely low"". The BMJ research looked at data on 170,000 women in Finland over 14 years. It found a 9%-17% increased risk for Alzheimer's, particularly in women taking HRT for more than 10 years. This equates to between nine and 18 extra cases of the disease per year in every 10,000 women aged between 70 and 80, the researchers said. But the study was observational and, as a result, it cannot be said for certain that other factors had not affected the results. Other studies have found that HRT actually improves brain function.   The Royal College of GPs said the research does not prove that HRT causes Alzheimer's disease, and women currently taking it should continue to do so. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the College, said: ""Hormone replacement therapy can be of greatest benefit to many women who are suffering from some of the unpleasant side-effects of the menopause, such as hot flushes and night sweats - and there is a large body of evidence that shows it is an effective and safe treatment for most women. ""We would urge patients not to be alarmed by this research - as the researchers state, any risk is extremely low - and if they are currently taking HRT, to continue doing so as prescribed by their doctor. "" However, she said there were risks with any medication and it was important that women were aware of them. ""To minimise any risk, best practice for most women is to prescribe the lowest possible dose of hormones for the shortest possible time in order to achieve satisfactory relief of symptoms,"" Prof Stokes-Lampard said. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a treatment used to relieve symptoms of the menopause.  These can include hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings and reduced sex drive. HRT replaces hormones, like oestrogen, that are at a lower level as women stop having periods. It can also help prevent weakening of the bones, which is common after the menopause. The average age of menopause in the UK is 51. Around one million women in the UK use HRT for their menopausal symptoms, according to NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. And most women experience menopause symptoms for around four years, while one in 10 can suffer for up to 12 years. NICE guidelines say that the risks of HRT are small and are usually outweighed by the benefits. NHS advice explains the small potential risks of HRT for breast cancer and stroke. Alzheimer's charities said the BMJ research was inconclusive and women should not be worried about taking HRT for a short period of time. Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer for Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""Women who require hormone therapy should not be put off by these results, and anyone concerned about the effects of this treatment should speak to their doctor."" The BMJ study could not account for other risk factors for Alzheimer's such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and a family history of the disease.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47488249,"New guidelines on diagnosing high blood pressure could mean thousands more people benefiting from treatment in England and Wales. Health bosses say offering blood-pressure-lowering drugs to more people with stage-1 hypertension would help to cut heart attacks and strokes. In total, about 450,000 men and 270,000 women could now qualify for the drugs. But some GPs expressed concerns about over-diagnosis, saying the benefits could be limited. And they said lifestyle factors, such as weight control, diet and exercise, all had an important role to play in bringing down blood pressure.  At present, people with high blood pressure - a reading of 140/90mmHg or higher in clinic - are offered treatment if they have a 20% risk of cardiovascular disease over 10 years and are aged under 80.. The draft guidelines, announced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), recommend that people with a 10% risk should now qualify. This assessment score is based on a blood test several risk factors, including: NICE said it was difficult to predict the impact of lowering the threshold because some people in this group may already be taking blood-pressure-lowering drugs. The long-term plan for the NHS in England contains a commitment to diagnosing high blood pressure earlier and saving lives from heart attacks and strokes. High blood pressure affects more than one in four adults in England, accounts for more than one in 10 visits to GPs and contributes to 75,000 deaths every year - but millions of people are thought to go undiagnosed. Metabolic medicine consultant Anthony Wierzbicki, who chairs the NICE guideline committee, said high blood pressure was ""by far the biggest preventable cause of death and disability in the UK through strokes, heart attacks and heart failure"".  ""A rigorous evaluation of new evidence has resulted in updated recommendations around when to treat raised blood pressure that have the potential to make a real difference to the lives of many thousands of people with the condition,"" he added. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said the decision to lower the threshold for a diagnosis of hypertension, or high blood pressure, ""must not be taken lightly and must be evidence-based"". She added: ""GPs are highly trained to prescribe taking into account the guidelines but also the circumstances of the individual patient sitting in front of them, including physical, physiological and social factors that might be affecting their health.""  But other experts said the guidelines did not go far enough. ""Much lower blood pressure targets are required and multiple drugs need to be used right from the start, if patients are to achieve the largest reduction in the risks of stroke and heart attack,"" said Prof Stephen MacMahon, from the University of Oxford. The draft guidelines are open for public consultation until 23 April and final guidance is expected to be published in August.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47279032,"For some women, the menopause and the years leading up to it, can be a time of troubling emotional and physical symptoms.  Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) eases symptoms like hot flushes and sweats, but it's not suitable for all women. Now, a small study published in BMJ Open suggests acupuncture may be worth considering.  The Danish study found that five weeks of acupuncture in women with menopausal symptoms reduced hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbances and emotional problems.  Researchers at the University of Southern Denmark cautioned that they couldn't rule out that the results were down to the placebo effect.  The placebo effect is where a treatment works because a patient believes it will, rather than as a result of the treatment itself.   One of the study authors, Prof Frans Boch Waldorff, from the University of Southern Denmark, said: ""We can't explain the underlying mechanism behind acupuncture, nor determine how much of the effect is caused by placebo.  ""But this was a safe, cost-effective and simple procedure, with very few side-effects reported by the women.  ""Women seeking acupuncture treatment for menopausal symptoms should be informed of the current evidence, and its limitations, so they can make a decision."" Acupuncture is a treatment derived from ancient Chinese medicine, where fine needles are inserted at certain points in the body.  Researchers recruited 70 women with moderate-to-severe menopause symptoms.  This group was then split in two. The first group, the control group, received no acupuncture until week six of the study. The second, intervention group received weekly acupuncture treatments from experienced local doctors.  Each participant then completed a questionnaire to self-evaluate their symptoms at three and six weeks.  By six weeks the women in the acupuncture group recorded moderate improvements in all symptoms compared with the group having no acupuncture.  A total of 80% of the women in the acupuncture groups also said they felt the sessions had helped them.  Vanessa Southgate, an occupational therapist from Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, started suffering menopause symptoms when she was 46.   ""I'd always slept well, despite stressful events in my life. Yet suddenly I would wake in the early hours and not be able to get back to sleep. I felt bloated, had a foggy head, night sweats, and a level of anxiety I had never experienced before,"" she says.  The doctor suggested HRT but Vanessa decided she wanted to explore alternative treatments.  She went to see Emma Vickers, a licensed acupuncturist in Brighton. ""After a few sessions, the night sweats weren't as bad, and my sleep improved. It really helped with the bloating, that was so uncomfortable before. It also helped the anxiety. After the treatment I felt way more relaxed, and that I could manage things more."" Vanessa now goes for weekly acupuncture treatments. Sometimes she takes a break, and when the symptoms return she books in again.  ""I do feel it is the acupuncture that makes the difference, and also working with Emma. She has suggested supplements, and advised on nutrition.  ""And we've also looked at my work-life balance and switching off at night. These are things I knew already, but it makes a difference when somebody suggests you try something.""  Dr Channa Jayasena, a consultant in reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College and Hammersmith Hospital, said: ""Menopausal flushes will affect most women at some point. HRT cannot be given to women with certain types of cancer.  ""This leaves a huge gap in the market for simple and safe therapies to reduce hot flush symptoms.  ""I suspect that most of the effect of acupuncture is a placebo effect, but is that a really bad thing? Anything that is safe, affordable and helps the wellbeing of patients while reducing symptoms is worth considering if HRT is not an option."" Last year, an episode of the BBC programme Horizon looked into the potential power of the placebo effect. The programme prescribed fake pills to 100 volunteers with back pain. Half of the participants found significant relief from taking the pills - even though they were fake. Acupuncture treatment is available on the NHS, usually for migraines or chronic headaches.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47485589,"Cuts to benefits and wider economic hardship are increasing demand for mental health care, NHS bosses say. Mental health leaders in England cited the rollout of universal credit, in particular, as a key factor. They also said money problems and job worries alongside social factors, such as loneliness, were adding pressure to an already stretched system. The government acknowledged there were ""challenges"" in reforming benefits, but said it was tackling them. A spokesman also stressed that mental health services were a ""key priority"" for the boost in funding to the health service in the coming years. He said the extra £2.3bn being invested by 2023 would increase the proportion of the budget spent on mental health. 'We're not complacent though and we know that change won't happen overnight,"" he added. The way the government is overhauling the benefits system has attracted criticism. A new system called universal credit is currently being rolled out. It involves the merger of six different benefits for working age people into one monthly payment. While the system, first introduced in 2013, was supposed to be up and running by 2017, it is now not expected to be fully operational until 2023. However, it has been criticised for running over budget, causing delays to people's payments and, in some cases, making vulnerable people worse off. The government said it was ""making improvements"" to the system as it was rolled out, but said universal credit would simplify the system and ""tailor support"" better to help those most in need.  However, NHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said her members were clear that ""social and economic pressures are translating into higher demand for services"". She said the feedback showed that rising demand was causing problems as services struggled with staff shortages. This meant there were insufficient services in the community and patients needing hospital-based care were at risk of being sent away from their home areas. The mental health bosses provided feedback to their trade body NHS Providers. The group asked bosses from mental health trusts to answer questions via an online survey. A total of 35 bosses answered questions about economic and social factors from nearly 60% of England's dedicated mental health trusts. The benefits system and the changes being made were said to be increasing demand by 32 trusts. Meanwhile, 34 cited financial hardship, 33 homelessness and 31 job instability as factors. Wider social issues, such as a lack of local services and loneliness were also highlighted by many. Paul Farmer, chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said: ""Changes to the benefits system in recent years, and austerity generally, have had a devastating impact on the lives of many people with mental health problems."" Will Higham, associate director of campaigns and public affairs at Rethink Mental Illness, added: ""If we're to have a benefits system that is fit for purpose, it is vital that staff are educated on what it means to live with mental illness and that they take the time to understand and care about those who use it."" Denise Martin, 49, from Bristol, is one person who says the economic climate has made her struggles with mental illness more difficult, causing her sleeplessness and anxiety. She has had mental health problems since she was 16 and has now been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and also struggles with her mobility because of spinal problems and chronic pain. She has had experience of applying for benefits since 2011 when she had to give up work as a mental health nurse. She currently gets employment support allowance and personal independence payments for her physical problems. But she said she has found benefits staff difficult to deal with and insensitive to her condition. ""I can't tell you how stressful it is.  ""When you get a strongly worded letter in large letters saying, 'If you do not get all the evidence in a month, your benefit will stop,' it throws everything off-kilter and gives you a feeling of hopelessness.

Larger studies are now needed to confirm the findings. Breast milk alone does not always meet the dietary needs of vulnerable babies born before 37 weeks, with about half failing to grow properly. Dr Luise Marino, clinical academic paediatric dietician at Southampton Children's Hospital, said all babies' weights dip by about 10% soon after birth, through water loss. ""But you don't want preterm babies to do that,"" she said. ""They don't have as much fat, minerals or iron, so they need extra nutrients."" Currently, in the UK, breastfed premature babies are given a supplement packed with proteins and minerals, such as calcium, during their stay on neonatal units. At this stage, the supplements, also known as breast milk fortifier, are mixed with breast milk and given to babies through feeding tubes. However, once premature babies are sent home, when they have reached an acceptable weight, the supplements stop. GPs cannot prescribe them, and so any additional nutrients these babies need are often obtained from formula milk, the researchers from Southampton Children's Hospital said. They looked at the effects of giving the supplements to 32 mothers and their babies for eight weeks at home and found improvements in the newborns' weight, head growth and length, at eight weeks and again at 12 months, compared with premature babies who were only breastfed. The average weight of babies in the study was 2.8lb (1.3kg) at birth, and most were born at about 30 weeks of pregnancy.  When they went home, the babies weighed 5.5lb on average. The supplement sachets can be added to a small amount of expressed breast milk and given to babies by cup or syringe before each breastfeed. Dr Marino said parents involved in the study said they felt less worried about their baby's growth and found it easy to give the supplements to their babies. She said larger studies were now needed to see if the results could be repeated. The study is published in Archives of Disease in Childhood.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47500386,"Margaret Thatcher apparently used alternative medicines and was sent them by romance author Dame Barbara Cartland, newly released files show. Dame Barbara, who wrote more than 800 books and was Princess Diana's step-grandmother, sent the then-prime minister capsules to tackle tiredness. Baroness Thatcher is famously said to have slept for only four hours a night. Dame Barbara also sent supplements to tackle jetlag or travel sickness ahead of a trip to the Far East. The Margaret Thatcher Foundation is gradually overseeing the release of her private files.  Also included among them is a briefing from a young David Cameron on the European single market. In this most recent batch of files released by the foundation, letters show that Dame Barbara corresponded with Baroness Thatcher fairly regularly and lunched with her. Dame Barbara is best known for her historical romance fiction and was most prolific in the 1970s and 80s when she also appeared regularly on television.  Even aged in her 80s, she was writing an average of 23 books a year.  In one letter, dated 8 June 1989, she wrote to ""my dear prime minister"" after seeing her the night before.  ""It is incredible, with all you do, how you can still look as though you were 25,"" she wrote.  Dame Barbara enclosed a new product from the ""Health Movement"" in case Baroness Thatcher ever felt tired.  The novelist told Baroness Thatcher the product ""takes oxygen to every part of the body, including the brain"" and that as someone aged nearly 88 herself, she found it ""fantastic"". And just a few weeks later, on 3 July 1989, Dame Barbara sent another product to the prime minister's diary secretary, Amanda Ponsonby, for her to give Mrs Thatcher to take on a long trip to the Far East. She said it would not induce sleep, but ""just stops that awful feeling in the head and ears"". In November of the same year, Baroness Thatcher wrote to the novelist after a ""wonderful luncheon"" and thanked her for a ""golden acorn"". It is not clear what this item was, but Baroness Thatcher wrote: ""I shall need it in the coming days!""  At the time, her chancellor had resigned the month before, and a leadership challenge had been launched. Elsewhere in the newly released files are references to Baroness Thatcher taking royal jelly and vitamin C. According to a profile in Vanity Fair magazine in June 1989, the former prime minister was also fond of ""electric baths"" in which 0.3 amps of electricity was run through water in a bid to stay youthful. Chris Collins, of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, said he believed her interest in alternative medicines was genuine, though references in the archives were ""obscure, perhaps deliberately so"". The ""electric baths"" report generated a lot of attention in the world's media. He said Baroness Thatcher's press secretary Bernard Ingham could not treat lightly ""the impression of dottiness, of a woman 'slightly off her trolley'."" The files, available for the public to view from Monday at www.margaretthatcher.org, also include a briefing paper on the benefits of the coming European Single Market, written by a young David Cameron, who was then at the Conservative Research Department. ""We believe that creating a single community market will be good for Britain, good for Europe and good for the world,"" runs the opening quote, from the party's manifesto for the European elections in 1989. Pages initialled by ""DC"" set out how the single market, due to start in 1992, would help business, workers, consumers, savers, holidaymakers. It detailed the changes in different sectors of the economy and was extremely positive about the effect this would have.   The files also reveal that Mrs Thatcher tried to refuse the resignation of her chancellor Nigel Lawson in October 1989, calling it ""an absurd proposition"" and a ""flimsy and unworthy proposal"". According to the note, she told him to ""go away and think again"".  Documents also refer to a leadership challenge launched by Sir Anthony Meyer later that year. While Baroness Thatcher won the MPs' vote decisively that December, documents show at least one of her advisers feared this was ""the beginning of the end of the Thatcher era"". She left office in 1990, after 11 years as prime minister.",,,,

The measure is among a series of UK-wide recommendations put forward by Public Health England. PHE medical director Paul Cosford told the BBC: ""We should stop idling outside schools and we should make sure that children can walk or cycle to school."" PHE said 28,000 to 36,000 deaths a year in the UK could be attributed to long-term exposure to air pollution. The report said local authorities could implement no-idling zones in areas with vulnerable hotspots such as schools, hospitals and care homes. It also recommends a wider uptake of low emission or clean air zones to discourage the most highly polluting vehicles from entering populated areas. It describes air pollution as the biggest environmental threat to health in the UK and says there is strong evidence that air pollution causes the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer, and exacerbates asthma. Although England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales lead on air quality policy in their own territories, PHE contributes to the implementation of the government's UK-wide strategy. Professor Cosford told BBC Radio 5 Live conversations needed to be had between local authorities, schools and parents about how to ""stop the emissions at source"". The PHE review also recommends: Prof Cosford said: ""Transport and urban planners will need to work together with others involved in air pollution to ensure that new initiatives have a positive impact.  ""Decision makers should carefully design policies to make sure that the poorest in society are protected against the financial implications of new schemes."" PHE said that national government policy could support these local actions - for example, they could allow controls on industrial emissions in populated areas to take account of health impacts.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47447603,"The US state of Alabama is pioneering a project to train school staff - including teachers, coaches and administrators - how to treat pupils suffering from drug overdoses.  ""Times have changed. Kids are getting things out of their parents' cabinets. They don't have to go out on the street, and they don't know what they are taking,"" says Jan Cibulski, school nursing supervisor in rural Shelby County - one of the regions signing up to the programme.  Until the start of the year, the state - like most others - recommended school nurses administer the treatment, but now they are widening the training to other teaching staff, as the opioid epidemic spirals nationwide.  The medication - naloxone - is being included in schools' standard emergency kits, alongside defibrillators and allergy-remedying Epipens.  For US teaching staff, the training could become another standard procedure, like shooting drills. Florida is considering a similar initiative.  In Columbiana, a small town in the heart of Alabama's Shelby County, the first training sessions are being held at a CTEC high school. Specialising in vocational skills, it has a well-equipped medical teaching room, including life-sized dummies that are usually used by pupils who want to go into nursing. A demonstration on one of the mannequins shows how quick and easy the treatment is. After calling 911 and trying mouth-to-mouth, you press the Evzio auto-injector - which resembles a cigarette packet - against the patient's outer thigh, through their clothes. A stilted automated voice counts down how long you need to leave it in place (five seconds).  Using the device takes barely a minute, and then it typically takes around another minute or two for an unconscious victim to rouse. The patient tends to spring up, confused and agitated, so part of the training involves preparing teaching staff for this shock. The staff member also will need to keep them from running away, so they can get urgent medical attention once the emergency services arrive. Plus, they will get tips on spotting signs of an overdose in the first place. Alabama's department of education says the training has been designed to help teaching staff get over their fear factor associated with such an emergency. The injectors can't do any harm, they say.  Authorities say no child is known to have overdosed in Alabama's school system, but they fear it could be a matter of time. They say they want to be proactive, rather than wait for the first tragedy.  In 2015, the state was the highest prescribing state in the nation for opioid pain-relief prescriptions, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The state is said to have more opioid prescriptions than people. The non-mandatory scheme is available to every high school in the state. The costs are covered by a grant via the state's department of public health.  Jennifer Ventress - nurse administrator for the state's department of education - says there has been a ""tremendous interest"", and around 21 local education agencies have signed up since the scheme was first unveiled in January. If funding can be secured, it will be offered to elementary schools, too.  Amy Mason, a principal at Madison County Elementary School in Gurley, a tiny town in the state's north, says she would definitely be interested. Her school takes pupils aged up to 13. She had a wake-up call in 2015, when some of the older students were rushed to hospital after taking prescription drugs in the classroom. They did not overdose and the drug - Lyrica - was not classed as an opioid, but she says it was a career first for her and a sign of a widening problem. ""The more training, the better it is for all involved,"" she says.  The project has been in the pipeline for two years, involving various bodies working together.  State Attorney General Steve Marshall told local news reporters that he had hesitated to back it at first, as he worried it would encourage more drug usage.  ""I was talking to one of the doctors about that, and he looked at me and said, 'Well, I can't help them if they're dead',"" Mr Marshall told the WAAY-TV. ""That was an eye-opener for me.""  He has since offered support. The issue has a personal significance for him as his wife killed herself last year after battling mental illness and addiction. Not One More Alabama - an awareness group for families tackling drug problems - also supports the schools' initiative.  Board member Selina Mason told the BBC she hoped talking about the issue more would reduce stigma. ""We still use terminology about letting people hit the bottom, we have to change that. We don't have the luxury of waiting. And there may be many bottoms, not just one.""  She also talks from personal experience as the mother of a son who struggles with addiction. ""I carry naloxone in my backpack. If a loved one is an opioid addict, you need to have it in your home, in your car, in your purse,"" she says.   The US surgeon general gave the same advice last year, instructing all Americans who are at risk of overdose - and those close to them - to carry naloxone. The Food and Drug Administration is also currently considering whether to recommend doctors prescribe the antidote at the same time as pain killers for patients considered at high risk.  Naloxone is already kept on hand in various community centres and police stations, and is stocked by plenty of pharmacies. It also comes as a nasal spray, often under the brand name Narcan. However, although insurers often pick up the bill, it remains costly.  Kaleo, which produces the Evzio injector used in Alabama schools, came under criticism last year after hiking up its prices, from $575 (£435) to more than $4,000 per device. A Senate subcommittee report said the company was exploiting a national crisis.  The company rejected the accusation. It said a cheaper generic version ($178 for two) will launch later this year.  A bill that would allow naloxone to be available in schools in Florida was filed last month by a Democratic member of the Florida legislature, Jason Pizzo, and remains under consideration. Unlike Alabama, the state has already had multiple cases of in-school opioid overdoses.  Two weeks ago, a 14-year-old boy was charged after bringing a prescription drug from his home and distributing it to classmates at Horizons Academy in Bradenton, Florida, according to the local press. Three students were taken to hospital, where one was revived with naloxone.",,,,

It's a rare skin condition called congenital melanocytic naevus (CMN). The 24-year-old from Cambridgeshire is one of 30 people with CMN taking part in an international exhibition.  ""For someone else to see the way I look as art and something to be celebrated is really amazing for me,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Gemma, a fourth-year medical student in Leeds, was born with CMN, which is untreatable: ""I was told they were my brown patches or birthmarks."" As a child she says her life was like anyone else's. ""I did normal things and had normal friends and I even did gymnastics and trampolining - which involved a leotard that revealed my birthmarks and I didn't think anything of it when I was growing up. ""It wasn't until I became a teenager that it really affected me. ""I realised I looked different and I felt quite self-conscious about it - I didn't really know anyone else with the condition. ""I used to wear scarves, long sleeves, and I would wear full aussie cozzies instead of bikinis."" But Gemma tells us she just got ""fed up"" of feeling self-conscious and when she was around 17 she booked a holiday to Spain with her friend where, for the first time in years, she wore a bikini. ""No-one even stared or said anything. It was kind of like exposure therapy in a way. ""I started enjoying life more to the full.

""I was only wearing my pants, with someone I've never met. I wasn't wearing any make-up and I didn't do anything with my hair. ""Usually I like to be in control of how I look and how I'm perceived, especially when taking pictures. But to give all of that to someone else did make me feel quite vulnerable. ""In doing so, it made me come to terms more with how I look and that I can't always have control over how other people see me.""

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47536981,"Italian children have been told not to turn up to school unless they can prove they have been properly vaccinated. The deadline follows months of national debate over compulsory vaccination. Parents risk being fined up to €500 (£425; $560) if they send their unvaccinated children to school. Children under six can be turned away. The new law came amid a surge in measles cases - but Italian officials say vaccination rates have improved since it was introduced. Under Italy's so-called Lorenzin law - named after the former health minister who introduced it - children must receive a range of mandatory immunisations before attending school. They include vaccinations for chickenpox, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella. Children up to the age of six years will be excluded from nursery and kindergarten without proof of vaccination under the new rules.  Those aged between six and 16 cannot be banned from attending school, but their parents face fines if they do not complete the mandatory course of immunisations. The deadline for certification was due to be 10 March after a previous delay - but as it fell on a weekend, it was extended to Monday.  ""Now everyone has had time to catch up,"" Health Minister Giulia Grillo told La Repubblica newspaper. She had reportedly resisted political pressure from deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini to extend the deadline even further. Ms Grillo said the rules were now simple: ""No vaccine, no school"". Italian media report that regional authorities are handling the situation in a number of different ways. In Bologna, the local authority has sent letters of suspension to the parents of some 300 children, and a total of 5,000 children do not have their vaccine documentation up to date. In other areas there have been no reported cases, while still others have been given a grace period of a few days beyond the deadline. The new law was passed to raise Italy's plummeting vaccination rates from below 80% to the World Health Organisation's 95% target. On Monday - the last day for parents to provide documentation proving their children had been properly vaccinated - the Italian health authority released figures claiming a national immunisation rate at or very close to 95% for children born in 2015, depending on which vaccine was being discussed. The 95% threshold is the point at which ""herd immunity"" kicks in - when enough of the population is vaccinated for the spread of the disease to become unlikely, thereby protecting those who cannot be vaccinated. That includes babies too young to be vaccinated themselves, or those with medical conditions such as a compromised immune system. Last month, an eight-year-old recovering from cancer was unable to attend school in Rome due to his weak immune system. The child had spent months receiving treatment for leukaemia, but was at risk of infection because a proportion of pupils in the school had not been vaccinated - including several in the same class. The Lorenzin law, drafted by the previous government, had a tumultuous birth. When the current coalition came to power, it said it would drop mandatory immunisations although it later reversed its position.  The two populist parties in power had faced accusations that they were pursuing anti-vaccination policies.  Writing in a Facebook post on Monday, Ms Grillo admitted it ""is a law that, at the time of approval, we criticised for several reasons"" - and said that the law would be changed to include only those vaccinations that were necessary based on scientific data. The anti-vaccination movement has been growing globally in recent years, sparking alarm from the World Health Organization. A long-discredited paper by Andrew Wakefield was behind much of the scare, but rumours around immunisation have continued to spread, leading to public health risks as not enough people are immune to such diseases. Mr Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register after fraudulently claiming there was a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and autism and bowel disease in children. He made the claim based on the experiences of just 12 children, and no other study since has been able to replicate his results.",,,,

Patricia Dowdy, 61, who worked for the renowned scientist for 15 years, was handed an interim suspension in 2016, it emerged at the weekend. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) has now found she did not ""provide the standards of good, professional care we expect and Professor Hawking deserved"". Mrs Dowdy told The Mail on Sunday she was upset and did not want to comment.  The NMC made its decision to remove Mrs Dowdy, from Ipswich, from the nursing register at a private hearing in London. A fitness to practise panel said Mrs Dowdy's behaviour amounted to financial misconduct, dishonesty, not providing appropriate care, failing to cooperate with the NMC and not having the correct qualifications. Matthew McClelland, director of fitness to practise, said: ""As the public rightly expects, in serious cases such as this - where a nurse has failed in their duty of care and has not been able to give evidence to the panel that they have learned from their mistakes and be fit to practise - we will take action.

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47553526,"Leading scientists have called for a ban on research to ""re-engineer the human species"" for the next five years.  Two babies were born last year in China who had been genetically altered to protect them against HIV.  The scientists, writing in the journal Nature, said ""major speed bumps"" needed to be put in front of such research.  The US National Institutes of Health said a ban should start immediately, but others have criticised the idea.  It all comes down to the ability of scientists to manipulate DNA. Our DNA contains the instructions for building and running the human body including traits such as height, hair colour and risk of diseases. A relatively new tool called CRISPR has allowed scientists to quickly and cheaply alter DNA and has led to an explosion in gene editing technologies.  They have the potential to be used to ""re-engineer"" us by correcting faults in DNA that cause disease or even to enhance the human body.  In November last year, Prof He Jiankui announced the birth of twin girls known as Lulu and Nana. But what made them different to any other child was that their DNA had been tweaked in a lab. Gene-editing tools were used to give them protection against HIV by, effectively, changing the locks on the door that HIV uses to infect our cells.  Prof He made the announcement in a video saying: ""I understand my work will be controversial - but I believe families need this technology and I'm willing to take the criticism for them."" He performed this using his own money, in his own time and against Chinese regulations.  The full consequences of gene-editing babies are uncertain, but the effects are permanent. Any modifications are passed on down through the generations, introducing a lasting change to the human race.  But the science is so new that it is unknown whether it is safe, and there may be unintended consequences of altering seemingly simple parts of human DNA. Prof He altered the CCR5 gene in the twins to protect them against HIV, but this gene also has also has a role in fighting flu and potentially intelligence.  The science has also raced far ahead of the public debate about what is acceptable - is it OK to genetically modify an embryo to stop a child growing up with a fatal disease? What about ""enhancements"" that have no medical benefit?  They say gene-editing has ""implications for the entire species"" and decisions about its use cannot be made by individual scientists. And that it was up to the world to decide whether gene-editing should be completely banned, used only medically or even adopted for wide-scale human enhancement.  For now, they want a global moratorium (a temporary ban) on using gene-editing for sperm, eggs and embryos that would be used to create a baby. They want this ban to last for five years.  It would not affect using gene-editing for research or for using gene-editing in adults when any changes could not be passed on to subsequent generations.  Then, they argue it is up to individual nations to make decisions ""with due respect to the opinions of humankind"". They say: The 18 researchers who have called for the moratorium include some of the leading figures in the field including Feng Zhang and Emmanuelle Charpentier, who made the key discoveries that have made gene-editing human cells possible.  No. Dr Francis Collins, the director of the US National Institutes of Health, said a moratorium should be ""put into effect immediately"" in light of the ""irresponsible and unethical research in China"". He said: ""Research on the potential to alter the very biological essence of humanity raises profound safety, ethical, and philosophical issues."" Dr Helen O'Neill, programme director of Reproductive Science and Women's Health at University College London, said there was already a global ban.  She said: ""Currently, there are (as there was in China) legal and ethical measures in place globally which regulate the use of gametes and embryos.  ""Let's not forget that He Jiankui broke many rules… it was not that he did this because the law allowed it.

The study shows that breast cancer is 11 separate diseases that each has a different risk of coming back.  The hope is that the findings, in the journal Nature, could identify people needing closer monitoring and reassure others at low risk of recurrence. Cancer Research UK said that the work was ""incredibly encouraging"" but was not yet ready for widespread use. The scientists, at the University of Cambridge and Stanford University, looked in incredible detail at nearly 2,000 women's breast cancers. They went far beyond considering all breast cancers as a single disease and beyond modern medicine's way of classifying the tumours. Doctors currently classify breast cancers based on whether they respond to the hormone oestrogen or targeted therapies like Herceptin.  The research team analysed the genetic mutations inside the tumour to create a new way of classifying them.  Previous work by the group has shown breast cancer is 11 separate diseases, each with a different cause and needing different treatment.  By following women for 20 years, they are now able to show which types of breast cancer are more likely to come back.  Prof Carlos Caldas tod the BBC: ""This is really biology-driven, it's the molecular wiring of your tumour. ""Once and for all we need to stop talking about breast cancer as one disease, it's a constellation of 11 diseases. ""This is a very significant step to more precision-type medicine."" It showed that triple negative breast cancers - one of the hardest types to treat - were not all one class of cancer, but two.  Prof Caldas said: ""One where if women have not relapsed by five years they are probably cured, but a second subgroup are still at significant risk of later relapse."" The research could help inform women of their future risk, but may also change the way their cancers are treated.  There were four subgroups of breast cancer that were both driven by oestrogen and had a ""markedly increased"" risk of recurrence. These women may benefit from a longer course of hormone therapy drugs like tamoxifen.  Cancer Research UK estimated that 12,300 women a year have such types of cancer in the UK. By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News Cancers tend to be named after the place you find them: breast, colon, prostate, lung - the list goes on.  But it has long been known that this is not good enough. This study shows the future of personalised medicine and tailoring treatment to the specific causes of someone's cancer.  Studies are already under way looking at which treatments may work best for different subtypes of breast cancer.  And other research groups are trying to get a similar insight into other forms of cancer too.  However, the way the scientists analysed and sorted the cancers is still too complicated to be introduced to the NHS.  It will need refining into a form that could be used as a routine way of analysing a woman's cancer.  Much larger studies involving up to 12,000 women are also planned, so that researchers can be certain of their results.  Prof Caldas said: ""I would not recommend it clinically yet, but we really are committed to making this available.  ""We are totally committed to having an NHS test, we haven't patented any of this.""  Prof Karen Vousden, Cancer Research UK's chief scientist, said: ""We're still a way off being able to offer this type of detailed molecular testing to all women and we need more research to understand how we can tailor treatments to a patient's individual tumour biology.

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47543985,"A new type of drug - called  bempedoic acid - could offer another weapon in the fight against bad cholesterol.  An international study suggests the pill lowers cholesterol in people who continue to have high levels despite taking other drugs such statins.  And scientists suggest the new therapy may also work as an alternative for people who are unable to take statins because of side-effects. The research is published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Researchers say they have asked UK and US drug regulators to consider whether to approve the pill.  Cardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people in the UK each year.  Bad cholesterol is one of the main reasons - it leads to blood vessels furring up and becoming easy to block.  Blockages can be fatal - starving the heart or brain of oxygen and causing heart attacks and strokes.  Cutting saturated fat and having a healthy diet, along with regular exercise, can help lower bad cholesterol.  But this doesn't work for everyone.  And, for some, genetic conditions - rather than lifestyle - increase their levels.  Millions of people worldwide are prescribed drugs, most commonly statins, to reduce the amount of bad cholesterol in the blood. But reported side-effects and how often these drugs are prescribed has attracted controversy. The new drug works by blocking a key enzyme in the body, used to make cholesterol.   Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, of the British Heart Foundation charity, says: ""On the whole, statins do a great job of lowering cholesterol.  However, this new drug could provide real benefit for the few people who can't take them or require additional treatments to get it to the right level.   ""The research suggests that it has the potential to reduce risk of heart attacks and strokes without major side-effects."" The study involved more than 1,000 people who had cardiovascular disease or a genetic cholesterol condition and who were already on cholesterol lowering drugs (mainly statins).  They were given a pill of bempedoic acid every day for a year, on top of their usual medication.  About 700 others were instead given a placebo or dummy pill. After three months, the group who had taken the new pill had cut their bad cholesterol by 17%, compared with the group given a dummy pill.  Prof Kausik Ray, from Imperial College London, says: ""Bempedoic acid could be another addition to the arsenal of cholesterol lowering treatments available to patients.  ""What we have is a new class of drug that could be given to patients who are already taking statins and could help them further reduce their cholesterol levels and thus potentially cut their risk of heart attacks and strokes."" Every drug has side-effects, so it will be up to the patient and doctor to balance the individual benefits and risks.  Researchers say the rate of side-effects were similar between the group that took bempedoic acid and the group that didn't.  One side-effect that people on bempedoic acid experienced more was gout.  And more people stopped taking the new drug because of side-effects than people in the dummy pill group.  But unlike statins, researchers say, it works in the liver only and cannot reach the muscles. So, some scientists predict, it will not have some of the side-effects that some people experience with statins.  But others are unsure and more research is needed to see if this is true and understand how many people the new pill could help.  Studies so far, of which this latest one is the largest, suggest bempedoic acid can lower bad cholesterol - but we don't yet know how long for or whether this will definitely translate into fewer heart attacks and strokes.  Prof Jane Armitage, at the University of Oxford, described these latest results as promising.  Another, genetic, study, published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine, offers clues that the benefits of taking bempedoic acid - in terms of preventing heart disease and strokes - could be similar to that achieved by statins.  But Prof Armitage added: ""Genetic studies cannot tell us whether the drug will be safe for a wide range of people."" A clearer picture of how safe and effective the drug is will emerge once a longer term trial looking at the number of heart attacks and strokes on the new drug is completed. The US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, will examine this data once it is available, in a few years' time.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47500686,"It was a revelation that left Nicky Rowlands aghast - the moment she discovered she was being accused of fabricating the illness that had left her daughter in pain. Worse was to come. Her daughter Bethanie had to go to a hospital unit for a psychological disorder which she did not have. As a child, Bethanie complained of constant pain when she walked and was often sick after eating or drinking. Then after a routine tonsillectomy operation in 2014, she stopped eating completely. ""I knew as soon as she'd had the operation, something wasn't right,"" said Nicky.  ""They assumed she had infections, but she couldn't even keep the antibiotics in and they had to feed her through a tube."" Bethanie said: ""It hurt so much when I first had the operation, but I don't think anyone expected it to, or knew why.   ""I kept on trying to eat and I just got progressively more poorly."" For some time, medical staff looking after Bethanie searched for a diagnosis.  An explanation Nicky had found through searches on the internet was, she said, laughed away as being extremely rare.   Then the arrival of a letter marked a change in the attitude of doctors. Nicky was told she was being investigated by social workers for inventing her daughter's symptoms, and Bethanie was to be sent to a psychiatric unit almost 100 miles away, in Southampton, where she stayed for 10 months between 2015 and 2016. ""When we received that letter, it was very clear that it wasn't Bethanie they were talking about,"" Nicky says. ""I flagged it straight away and said 'you have the wrong person'. ""I asked them to check their notes to see if someone else's had got mixed up in it and they said that just doesn't happen."" Nicky was refused access to the notes, as the child protection wheels were then in motion. Social workers thought Nicky was displaying Fabricated or Induced Illness (FII) - what used to be known as Munchausen by Proxy - where parents deliberately make their children ill. Nicky's was one of 12 families in Gloucestershire suspected of having invented their children's symptoms. These cases have been looked at by a social worker and all the allegations of FII have now been dropped. The allegations against Nicky began to unravel when she finally got Bethanie's medical notes.   ""All of a sudden it was like reading something from a different author. I read back the page before and said 'we must find a medical reason for Bethanie's issues'.  ""Then all of a sudden it started talking about all of these symptoms she had never had,"" Nicky explains. She realised that another girl's name was on the notes - and this girl had an eating disorder, had self-harmed and was withdrawing from an addiction to painkillers. Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Board, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust and Gloucestershire County Council would not comment on Bethanie's case, but, in a joint response to the report, they said they would review their processes and staff training, and would welcome feedback and input from parents. Their spokesperson said: ""Fabricated or Induced Illness is a complex area, and, whilst it is uncommon, when it is suspected, we work swiftly with our health and social care partners to ensure that children are kept safe - their welfare being of paramount importance.  ""In such instances, we consider all the information available, with considerable emphasis on reaching professional consensus and acting appropriately in line with our protocol for jointly investigating suspected FII."" University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust said the mix-up of notes in Gloucestershire did not influence the clinical care she received at its children's unit, and an investigation found no further action was required. In Nicky's case, the suspicion ended when she finally received a diagnosis for Bethanie.   Her daughter was suffering from the condition she thought she had identified before Bethanie was sent away: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a rare illness which can cause joint hypermobility, extreme tiredness and digestive problems.  While she is now back with her family, 15-year-old Bethanie knows she has a lifelong condition which means she will be fed by tube.  And Nicky feels the best years of her daughter's life have been ruined. Nicky also had to give up her job because of the circumstances in which she and her daughter found themselves.  ""Bethanie lost four years of her life, she lost the rest of her childhood, and I've lost my life savings,"" she said.  You can hear 5 Live Investigates on BBC Sounds.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47393050,"""As a child I was restrained, stripped and left in a room for three days,"" says Clarissa, 24. Grace, 25, says: ""I was very suicidal, I didn't see any point in living."" Both Clarissa and Grace have borderline personality disorder and they have spent much of the last decade in and out of mental health hospitals. They are now on one of the first mental health wards to abandon practices such as restraint, seclusion and rapid tranquilisation of patients, which are used to stop those with mental illnesses from harming themselves. They are among 12 women being treated on Springbank Ward at Fulbourn Hospital near Cambridge, using a technique called dialectical behaviour therapy. Both young women are now well enough to take their first holiday in almost 10 years. Clarissa told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme: ""I've never felt this well, either as an adult or as a child.  ""I barely left my bed for a year before coming here.  ""Now I am up every day, we go out walking, to the shops, swimming three or four times a week. It's just a completely different life."" Clarissa says restrictive practices, which she used to experience regularly at other hospitals, ""take away everything you've got"". ""I was restrained, stripped, put in anti-ligature clothing against my will and left in a room with two people watching me for about three days.  ""In some places it's scary because it is used as a first resort."" Fellow patient Marianna, 21, says she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for the best part of five years. ""Once I was carried by my arms and legs to a de-escalation room where I was restrained for four hours, face down into a bean bag.  ""I had staff laying on top of me, I was rushed into hospital, my body just shut down from panic,"" she says.  Instead of restraint and seclusion, the staff on Springbank ward - who patients describe as 'amazing' - use different techniques to manage patients' distress, including mindfulness and a type of talking therapy.  It teaches patients different ways of dealing with distressing emotions, which have previously resulted in self-harm or suicide attempts. Grace says: ""There is a lot of stigma around personality disorders.  ""For me it brings on intense emotions that are hard to control, which might provoke feelings that you might want to self-harm.""  She added that it might also provoke suicidal feelings, and other mental health problems like depression, anxiety disorders and eating disorders. The consultant in charge, Dr Jorge Zimbron, and his team of specialists carried out research for the three years before restrictive practices were eradicated, and the three years since, when dialectical behaviour therapy was used.  ""It breaks down how to do certain things that people take for granted, which involve interpersonal relations, emotional regulation and distress tolerance. We can all improve our skills on each of those areas, whether suffering from a mental health problem or not,"" he says. Results were dramatic, with a drop from 56 restraints a year to just six, and the virtual eradication of rapid tranquilisation, down to just one in the past 3.5 years.  The methods are now being used by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, for what it describes as one of the largest 'quality improvement programmes' in mental health anywhere in the world. Dr Amar Shah, from the College, says they were inundated with requests to take part: ""These wards have the highest use of restrictive practice. Each of those wards are getting a lot of support to understand the factors leading to the use of restriction and to come up with their own ideas about what may make a difference, and to test them out.  ""Our goal is, over the next 15 months, to reduce the use of restrictive practice by a third,"" he said. Last December, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, asked the Care Quality Commission to carry out a review of the use of restrictive practices against people with mental health problems, learning disabilities and autism. The first report will be published in May 2019. Hear more on Radio 4's You and Yours programme.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-47460059,"When Stephanie Elderton's twin boys caught a cold, she never imagined that one of them would end up in intensive care. But the cold developed into bronchiolitis - and while bronchiolitis is usually a mild illness, in rare cases it becomes serious. Reece and Luca are adorable twin boys.  Now aged 14 months, they were born prematurely in 2017, arriving at 34 weeks. Reece weighed 4lb 7oz and Luca 4lb 2oz. ""They are identical boys but personality wise they are completely different,"" says Stephanie. ""They are very chatty, they're very lively. They love balls and any pop up toys and spinning toys. They like to laugh and they like to run. ""Well - Reece likes to run. Luca's a lot more serious, I would say, than Reece. He is quite happy to just be by himself and play by himself."" Despite being premature, the twins did not require any special care. Soon after the birth they went home to join their older brother Jamie, who is now five. But in January 2018, when the twins were five-and-a-half weeks old, Stephanie noticed that a cold they had both been suffering from was getting worse, so she asked her GP's surgery for advice. ""Luca stopped feeding as much and I mentioned this to the doctor, I mentioned this to the health visitor and they basically said, 'No, it's absolutely fine, they've just got a cold.' ""I said, 'OK, no problem, we'll just carry on as we are.' Then, when they were six weeks old, he wasn't waking, he wasn't eating, and so I took him back to the doctor's and I was like, 'There is something really wrong because this is just not how a baby should be.'"" Stephanie also noticed changes in the way the twins were breathing - it was much faster than normal and more laboured. The GP sent Stephanie straight to the local hospital, Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire, where Luca was instantly put on a monitor to check the oxygen levels in his blood. ""They said he really wasn't very well and they put him straight into the high dependency unit (HDU) and then they looked at Reece and went, 'We think he's the same,'"" says Stephanie. The HDU is a ward designed for people who need close observation, but not intensive care. The hospital doctors told Stephanie the twins were suffering from bronchiolitis, a condition she had never heard of. ""Bronchiolitis is a viral chest infection and it's usually caused by the common viruses that cause colds in adults,"" says Dr Francis Gilchrist, a consultant in paediatric respiratory medicine and trustee of the British Lung Foundation. It affects children under one year old, starting off with familiar cold symptoms. But with bronchiolitis the airways in the child's lungs become inflamed and swollen, causing them to narrow. In severe cases smaller tubes in the child's lungs - the bronchioles - clog up with mucus.  In the vast majority of cases, children recover at home within two to three weeks. But just occasionally severe cases occur - about 2-3% of all infants require hospitalisation, according to Francis Gilchrist. When to seek help Parents should seek urgent medical help if they see these ""red flag"" signs: Source: NHS and NICE The frustrating thing about bronchiolitis, he says, is that there is no effective treatment for the underlying condition. ""All the care that we do is supportive. So if necessary we give oxygen or support their breathing, or if they're really unwell they go on to have artificial ventilation in intensive care."" Fortunately this is very rare - it only applies to 0.1%, or one in 1,000 children. In the HDU, Luca was kept on observation for 24 hours but showed no signs of improvement. ""They did some X-rays to see what was going on and basically the whole of his left lung was completely blocked,"" says Stephanie.  At this point, the decision was taken to move him to Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge, where he could be ventilated. But then things suddenly got serious. ""When they tried to tube him, he basically stopped breathing altogether,"" says Stephanie. ""They had to give him CPR quite a few times and then they transferred us straight to Addenbrooke's hospital, to intensive care."" There the ventilator did the breathing for Luca to ensure more oxygen reached his tiny lungs. It was very hard for Stephanie to watch. ""He's just lying there, he's not awake because he's sedated and you can touch him, you can talk to him but he's not really him, you can't cuddle him or anything,"" she says. To make things harder, Reece had remained in Hinchingbrooke hospital and she had to keep phoning the ward for updates. ""It was very tough and I didn't have my car either so I couldn't come back and forth so I just stayed at Addenbrooke's,"" says Stephanie. ""I had to kind of shut Reece out - 'Luca's the one that needs me now - Reece is fine, he's getting the help he needs' - and just kind of not think about it. Because otherwise that would have worn me down even more."" Fortunately, Stephanie's mother was able to spend time at Reece's bedside. Because the boys were twins the medical team suspected they would both end up in the intensive care unit at Addenbrooke's, Stephanie says. But although Reece was very poorly, being fed via a nasal gastric tube, he stayed at Hinchingbrooke. Most cases of bronchiolitis are caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), something that most children will have been exposed to by the time they are three. However it can also be caused by other viruses, such as rhinovirus, the most common cause of the common cold. Why some children are affected more seriously than others, is still not fully understood, says Francis Gilchrist. Further help and advice: ""There are certain risk factors that children have that mean they're more at risk of having severe bronchiolitis and that would be if they're very young, if they were born prematurely, if they have pre-existing disease, such as congenital heart disease, or if they have an underlying problem with their immune system.  ""But there are some children who have none of those risk factors and end up with a severe episode, and we can't fully explain why."" After five days in intensive care, the medical team tried to take Luca off the ventilator and transfer him to a different method of breathing support, known as Continuous Positive Air Pressure (CPAP), but Stephanie says Luca couldn't take it and had to be put back on the ventilator again. ""I was very disheartened by that, because after five days he hadn't got any better, we're kind of moving backwards not forwards,"" says Stephanie. ""It felt as if it was never going to end."" During this time, Luca was having chest physiotherapy to try and loosen the mucus from his airways.  Finally, after seven days, he was taken off the ventilator and began to improve. Stephanie says it felt very strange to cuddle him again for the first time. ""It was a bit like, 'Aww I don't remember how to do this,'"" she says. Luca was taken back to the children's ward at Hinchingbrooke. His twin, Reece, had been discharged the day before, but Luca had a visit from his older brother, Jamie, who had been staying with Stephanie's parents while the twins were in hospital. ""It was just amazing to see him, because it felt like I hadn't seen him for such a long time,"" says Stephanie. Twenty-four hours later Luca was discharged too and the family was finally reunited at home. Terrified the boys would catch another cold, Stephanie did not take them outside. But two weeks later she noticed they were breathing rapidly again - and this time they had spots. She called an ambulance and the twins ended up back at Hinchingbrooke. There they were diagnosed with meningitis and put on intravenous antibiotics. There is no association between bronchiolitis and bacterial meningitis, says Francis Gilchrist. It seems as though the boys were just unlucky. After another six days in hospital they were able to return home, but again Stephanie was afraid to take them out. ""Because they're twins, obviously twins seem to be quite unusual, everyone wants to look at them, everyone wants to touch them, all the old ladies want to kiss them. It's just madness. So I was like, 'Please don't touch them, they could get poorly.'"" A year later, she still worries about them getting colds. ""If my bigger one gets ill, I'm like, 'Don't touch them, wash your hands!'"" she says. ""I'm very frightened every time they cough or anything.""  If they do get a cold, they tend to get very wheezy, Stephanie says, but they now have asthma inhalers and other medication to reduce airway inflammation. She's noticed that many parents know as little about bronchiolitis as she did before her children became ill, and is keen to raise awareness about the illness - and in particular about the possibility of severe symptoms, even if they only occur in a small minority of cases. ""I don't know why it's not out there, because of how serious it can be,"" she says. She says her hopes for the future are for her children to stay out of hospital and keep smiling. But she knows the trauma of winter 2018 didn't just leave her when the children were discharged. ""It's going to be here forever,"" she says.

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47554966,"Eating mushrooms more than twice a week could prevent memory and language problems occurring in the over-60s, research from Singapore suggests. A unique antioxidant present in mushrooms could have a protective effect on the brain, the study found. The more mushrooms people ate, the better they performed in tests of thinking and processing. But researchers said it was not possible to prove a direct link between the fungi and brain function. The National University of Singapore study's findings were based on 663 Chinese adults, aged over 60, whose diet and lifestyle were tracked from 2011 to 2017. Over the six-year study, the researchers found that eating mushrooms lowered the chances of mild cognitive impairment, so that roughly nine out of 100 people who ate more than two portions a week were diagnosed, compared with 19 out of 100 among those who ate fewer than one portion.  Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can make people forgetful, affect their memory and cause problems with language, attention and locating objects in spaces - but the changes can be subtle. It is not serious enough to be defined as dementia. The participants in the study were asked how often they ate six different types of mushrooms: oyster, shiitake, white button, dried, golden and tinned. Mushroom eaters performed better in brain tests and were found to have faster processing speed - and this was particularly noticeable in those who ate more than two portions a week, or more than 300g (10.5oz). ""This correlation is surprising and encouraging,"" said assistant professor Lei Feng, the lead study author, from the university's department of psychological medicine. ""It seems that a commonly available single ingredient could have a dramatic effect on cognitive decline. ""But we are talking about a combination of many factors - tea, green leafy vegetables, nuts and fish are also beneficial."" The researchers point to the fact that mushrooms are one of the richest dietary sources of ergothioneine - an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory which humans are unable to make on their own.  Mushrooms also contain other important nutrients and minerals such as vitamin D, selenium and spermidine, which protect neurons from damage. But there is still a long way to go before evidence of a direct link can be established. This study relied on self-reported information on mushroom intake and other dietary factors, which may not be accurate, the researchers acknowledged. Dr James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer's Society, said: ""There are lots of factors that contribute to the development of dementia and it's estimated that up to a third of cases could be prevented by changes in lifestyle, including diet.  ""Dementia is one of the top 10 causes of death, but people can take action to reduce their risk, so it's important that we base our advice on consistent evidence that's built up over multiple studies, and don't get carried away with the findings of any one single study.  ""So while eating a diet full of fruit and vegetables, including mushrooms, is a great starting point, our best advice is to also cut down on sugar and salt, be physically active, drink in moderation and avoid smoking.""  The study is published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47491964,"This is the list of what Laura Marston has sacrificed to keep herself alive: Her car, her furniture, her apartment, her retirement fund, her dog. At 36 years old, she has already sold all of her possessions twice to afford the insulin her body needs every day. Insulin is not like other drugs. It's a natural hormone that controls our blood sugar levels - too high causes vision loss, confusion, nausea, and eventually, organ failure; too low leads to heart irregularities, mood swings, seizures, loss of consciousness. For most of us, our bodies produce insulin naturally. But for Type 1 (T1) diabetics like Ms Marston, insulin comes in clear glass vials, handed over the pharmacy counter each month - if they can afford it.  One vial of the insulin Ms Marston uses now costs $275 (£210) without health insurance. In 1923, the discoverers of insulin sold its patent for $1, hoping the low price would keep the essential treatment available to everyone who needed it. Now, retail prices in the US are around the $300 range for all insulins from the three major brands that control the market. Even accounting for inflation, that's a price increase of over 1,000%. Stories of Americans rationing insulin - and dying for it - have been making national headlines.  The most famous case, perhaps, was 26-year-old Alec Smith, who died in 2017 less than a month after he aged out of his mother's health insurance plan. Despite working full-time making more than minimum wage, he could not afford to buy new insurance or pay the $1,000 a month for insulin without it. Ms Marston knows the feeling - like most of the diabetics I spoke to, she has experienced frightening lapses in coverage through no fault of her own. A few years ago, when the small law firm Ms Marston worked for abruptly closed, she found herself without an income and suddenly uninsured. ""I was spending $2,880 a month just to keep myself alive - that was more than I was making even working 50 hours a week,"" says Ms Marston. She was forced to leave her home in Richmond, Virginia, to find a new job in Washington DC to ensure she could pay for insulin. ""I sold everything, including my car, and had to give up my dog - he was eight and I had to give him away - and move to DC."" There are any number of reasons why someone might still be uninsured in America - if they don't qualify for employer-sponsored insurance or lose their job like Ms Marston had, for example, or if they cannot afford to pay for a plan on their own.  Ms Marston was diagnosed with T1 diabetes when she was 14. She laughs when recalling how the price of insulin in 1996 - $25 for one vial - was a shock to her.  Two decades later, Ms Marston still uses the same formula of insulin - Eli Lilly's Humalog. Even the packaging is the same. ""Nothing about it has changed, except the price has gone up from $21 a vial to $275 a vial."" It's the same story for Sanofi's Apidra and Novo Nordisk's Novolog.  Most patients point the finger at the pharmaceutical companies, who in turn bring up problems with government regulations and insurance providers.  At the heart of the issue is the complex mystery around who pays what for insulin in the US. There are five terms essential to this discussion - list price, net price, rebates, co-payments and deductibles. Insurance companies enlist third-party negotiators, called pharmacy benefit managers, to fix discounts with drug manufacturers that in turn result in smaller co-payment prices for their users. Experts say part of the system's problem is a lack of transparency around how these rebates are negotiated and how much actually makes its way to patients. This system also means that insurers end up with different rates for each drug company, so a brand of insulin that has a minimal co-pay under one insurance could cost the full list price under another. Ms Marston has been tracking insulin list prices for years. By her calculations, for insulin alone, she'll need close to $7m to live until she's 70 if she pays out of pocket. ""It's led to a situation where I decided I couldn't have kids because I don't feel financially stable enough,"" Ms Marston says. But drug manufacturers argue that very few people ever face paying list price.  Eli Lilly said in a statement to the BBC that 95% of people using Humalog in the US pay under $100 a month for their prescription, and that of the 600,000 using Humalog, ""about 1,600 people without insurance have not utilised the [assistance] benefits we offer"".  Novo Nordisk and Sanofi detailed similar patient assistance programmes in their statements. And several diabetics I spoke to did say that these programmes helped them- if they qualified. But another advocate, Kristen Daniels, says she was faced with a $2,400 price tag for one month of insulin and because she was technically insured, she couldn't get assistance. ""I called my insurance, I called the manufacturer, and no one could help me because I hadn't reached my deductible,"" Ms Daniels says. Pharmaceutical companies have also emphasised that rising list prices did not result in commensurate profits. Eli Lilly's spokesman says their net price has actually gone down in the last five years; Sanofi's said their insulin profits are 25% lower in 2019 than 2012.  According to a report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the University of Southern California Center for Health Policy and Economics, between 2007 and 2016, major brand insulin list prices have increased by 252%, while net prices saw less growth at 57%.  And there are cheaper options in the US for some: WalMart insulin, for example, is a re-branded version of a Novo Nordisk formula which retails for around $25 per vial in most states. But the formula is older, less effective, and some, like Ms Marston, are allergic to it. This is another key issue in the debate around skyrocketing insulin prices. Each formula works differently for each individual. It takes many T1 patients years to feel comfortable managing their dosing with a particular brand.  Several diabetics I spoke to say they have been forced to switch insulins by their insurance plans - even against the recommendation of their physicians - if they wanted to avoid paying the list price for their preferred brand. The ADA says this ""non-medical switching"" is more than an inconvenience - it's potentially dangerous, requiring constant monitoring on the patient's part and consultations with a physician.  Serious or permanent complications like blindness or kidney disease can arise if a diabetic is put through too many extreme sugar highs and lows. In America, where insurance coverage goes hand-in-hand with employment and options are limited, many T1 diabetics make sacrifices in other parts of their lives to keep affording insulin - whether that's staying with a stressful job or switching insulin formulas at the behest of an insurer. The expression that comes up again and again in the US T1 community is: ""We're hostages"". T1International is a non-profit advocating for affordable, accessible diabetes care worldwide. Founder Elizabeth Rowley is an American who now lives in the UK.  As a T1 diabetic herself, Ms Rowley has first-hand experience navigating both health systems. She describes the US system as ""convoluted"", with profits happening at all levels in between. ""People spend most of their life in fear of losing their insurance, of running out of insulin and the cost going up, or of having to stay in terrible jobs or relationships to ensure they keep their health insurance coverage,"" Ms Rowley tells me. ""That's the best case scenario. ""Worst case, folks are rationing insulin which has led to many reported deaths and excruciating complications. People are buying and sharing insulin from people online they have never met, having to choose between buying food, paying rent, or taking their medicine."" Diabetics in the US pay on average over $210 each month for insulin, according to a T1International 2016 survey, compared to less than $50 in India or nothing at all in some European countries. ""In the UK, I walked into the pharmacy, and with my medical exemption card, picked up my essential medicines. While the NHS is still overpaying for insulin, the cost it pays is miniscule compared to what people in the US must pay."" Ms Rowley acknowledges these other systems aren't perfect - but to her, they are still far better for patients. Lauren Hyre, 30, an Arizona-based advocate for T1International, knows first hand the fears of accessing insulin in the US system. She's struggled with it for two-thirds of her life.  Her father passed away when she was nine and his company cut off the family's health insurance. Before Obamacare, diabetics could be denied insurance, and so Ms Hyre was without coverage for years. Living in Indiana, a state without expanded health assistance programmes, she also didn't qualify for any government help. For years, Ms Hyre depended upon expired vials of insulin from her doctor's office and making trips to Canada to buy it at an affordable cost.  The first time she bought insulin at a Canadian pharmacy, her mother broke down in tears. There are dozens of similar stories across the southern border too. When 27-year-old Emily Mackey heard about a group of diabetics travelling to Tijuana, Mexico, to purchase cheaper insulin, she reached out on Instagram and joined in.  Ms Mackey was already in California for work, and so her tram ride from San Diego to Tijuana, Mexico, cost $5, round-trip.  A six-month supply of insulin set her back $100, a lot lower than the $1,300 cost if purchased through her insurance. But her relief soon turned to aggravation. Even if she had flown from her home in Philadelphia, buying insulin across the border would have saved her money. ""I was angry that I had to go to Mexico in the first place to get a drug that keeps me alive. I live right next to a [US pharmacy], yet had to travel 3,000 miles to another country to get affordable insulin."" According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), there are more than seven million diabetics in this country, and around 27% say that affording insulin has impacted their daily life. Dr William Cefalu, the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, says a lack of transparency is at the root of the issue. ""The system is dysfunctional. There are issues at each level, at each stakeholder in the insulin supply chain,"" he says. ""We can't point the finger at one particular entity."" Fixing issues with high deductibles and ensuring any discounts negotiated with insurance companies actually filter down to patients is key, he says. Competition would be the best way to bring prices down, so why hasn't that happened yet? Unlike chemical drugs, which can be simply replicated, insulin is a biological material - made up of proteins synthesised through a cell line that's unique to each formula.  Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Sanofi's insulins are all slightly different in this way, and no ""generic"" or un-branded copy could be made without accessing these companies' patented materials and processes. But despite these fundamental differences, insulin has long been classified and regulated like a chemical drug. In December, the FDA announced that the agency would reclassify insulin as a ""biological product"" by 2020, in what the FDA commissioner called a ""watershed moment for insulin"". These so-called biologics will then have an easier pathway to approval than before, promoting the development of ""products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with"" existing insulin. Insulin isn't the only drug affected by the tangled web of regulations and closed-door industry dynamics, but it is one of the few with life-or-death consequences attached to its price tag. For Ms Marston, it's hard to see why insulin was ever treated like other medications.  ""It's a natural hormone that everybody else's bodies make that ours don't,"" she says. ""There should be price caps on it just like everything else that's required for life: your water bill, your electric bill. Arguably those things are even less required than Humalog."" As an increasingly vocal Congress continues to hold hearings on drug pricing, pharmaceutical companies are beginning to feel the pressure.  Eli Lilly has announced it would be offering a new ""generic"" version of Humalog for half the cost. But the $137 price tag for this new generic is still steep - and significantly above what other countries pay for the same insulin. It's a move that may reduce what some pay at the pharmacy, but one that fails to address the systemic issues around insulin pricing.   Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, and Representative Jan Schakowsky, both Democrats, proposed a different solution in December. The Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would order the Department of Health and Human Services to create a new office focusing on manufacturing generic drugs ""in cases where the market has failed"" in order to ""jump-start"" competition.  The bill is unlikely to pass but it signals a serious interest from some lawmakers to change the existing system. Another avenue is the Medicare for All proposal pushed by Senator Bernie Sanders and other 2020 candidates, which would provide free healthcare for all, funded by higher taxes. As the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in industry board rooms, Ms Marston says she wants to continue her own advocacy on behalf of those who have fallen through the insurance gaps. ""In an instant, they were faced with having to pay list prices and could not do that, and that is why they died. ""If even one person has to pay list price, that's not fair,"" Ms Marston says. ""It's really someone having a gun to your head and saying: Your money or your life."" Photographs by Hannah Long-Higgins .",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46899521,"Sarah Hanan was at work when the doctor phoned. She had been expecting the call. A day earlier, seven months pregnant with her first child, the 29-year-old was in a Minneapolis hospital for a routine scan. ""About two weeks before, I was sitting on the couch with my husband, Ben, and noticed a harder spot on my breast,"" she told the BBC. The couple did not think much of it, but added it to the ""long list"" of things to ask about at the scan. ""Hey,"" she asked the doctor. ""I know this is probably nothing, but can you check it?"" Before she knew what was happening, she was having an ultrasound. Then a biopsy. And now the phone was ringing. The news was not good. ""In 24 hours I'd gone from being excited about our baby to being diagnosed with cancer,"" Sarah remembers. ""We were getting really excited - it was only a couple of months away. ""Then it felt like life came to a screeching halt. ""Do I have to make a decision about my baby boy? Do I have to make a decision about me?"" Ben recalls: ""It was a whirlwind from that to chemotherapy starting. It was diagnosed on a Thursday and we saw an oncologist on the Monday. ""It was pretty terrifying for a bit. You start to think, 'I don't want to be a single father. I don't want to lose my wife and son'. ""They did the test and saw it was a fast-developing aggressive cancer. ""All the doctors told us, as far as they knew, the chemo would not have an adverse effect on the baby. But we didn't really have a choice."" According to Macmillan Cancer Support, chemotherapy is the most common treatment given during pregnancy.  Research indicates that babies whose mothers have chemotherapy ""don't seem to have problems any different to babies whose mothers did not have chemotherapy"", the charity says. But that did not stop Sarah from worrying. ""As a mum sitting there, it was devastating putting these drugs into me. I couldn't even take ibuprofen but here I was having chemotherapy. ""But I want to be able to raise my son. I want to be there for him. So I wanted those survival rates to be as high as possible."" By the time of her first treatment, Sarah's tumour had already doubled in size. But despite chemotherapy side effects, including fatigue and nausea, the first trimester of her pregnancy had been much worse. ""It was actually almost a piece of cake,"" Sarah said. ""My first three months of pregnancy I was puking all the time and I had to go to the emergency room because I couldn't even keep fluids down. ""With chemotherapy, it was just nausea and everything tasted of metal. ""But I also knew that I was going to lose my hair. Knowing that I was going to be this bald woman was one of the biggest points to grasp, to understand that was going to be OK."" Early on a Monday morning one January, Sarah gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Noah. ""I only had to push for about 20 minutes,"" Sarah said. ""The nurses joked I should never tell other mothers that. ""He came out and immediately started crying. ""He grabbed on to my little finger and that was the moment it all became real. We became parents right there."" Sarah's treatment had stopped about three weeks before Noah was born. It resumed only a week after his birth. And the chemotherapy meant she could not breastfeed her son. ""I had been really looking forward to that, to being able to take care of my son like that. ""Some women choose not to but I felt like that was taken away from me, that I didn't have a choice."" Sarah will never breastfeed. In March, genetic testing revealed a mutation of the TP53 gene, which increases the risk of developing cancer. She is scheduled to have a double mastectomy in May. ""As a new mom that's been something which has been hard to accept,"" Sarah said. ""But it's all right. He's still going to be a smart, healthy boy and we'll just feed him formula."" The couple have been able to turn to their church, friends and family for help. Caring for a new baby is a big adjustment to make for any first-time parent. Doing so while undergoing intensive cancer treatment brings with it further challenges. ""Chemo wipes me out,"" Sarah said. ""It's impossible to do everything on our own. Luckily we have our church family to come in and help. ""It breaks my heart when I can't look after Noah, but we have to be able to ask for help."" Ben said: ""It's entirely possible this is the very beginning of a long and painful journey but I want people to be aware that it's a thing which happens,  ""Apparently one in 3,000 pregnant women get breast cancer. People really care about this stuff, but a lot of the time we're afraid to talk about it."" And if it was not for Noah, Sarah might not have been diagnosed so quickly, because she would not have been under the care of a doctor. ""Sarah getting pregnant saved her life. The clinic says she probably would have been dead in a year,"" Ben said. Sarah's tumour is shrinking, more quickly than average. But there is still a long road ahead. If live cancer cells are present when she has surgery, the next step is radiation therapy, then hormone therapy. She will have yearly scans for the rest of her life. She is positive, though. ""We're running a marathon. The goal this year is to be cancer-free. ""This is part of Noah's story too. And one day I'll tell him all about it. He's a miracle baby.""

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47585143,"A group of MPs is calling for a tax on social media companies' profits, saying the firms are operating in ""an online wild west"". Its report, which follows a year-long inquiry into the health impact of social media, says the industry should do more to protect children and young people online. The government is due to publish its own proposals within weeks. It says all kinds of steps are being explored to increase online safety. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Social Media and Young People's Mental Health and Wellbeing invited experts, charities, parents and young people to give evidence to its inquiry. It found that although social media had many positive effects, such as acting as a supportive community and a place of learning, it could also expose young people to cyber-bullying, self-harm and feelings of low self-esteem. The report acknowledged there was still a lack of robust scientific evidence that social media actually causes mental health problems in young people, but it said precautionary measures should be taken to minimise any potential harm. Last month, the UK's chief medical officers issued guidance on screen time, saying children should take a break from screen-based activities every two hours and phones should be kept out of bedrooms at bedtime. The report's main recommendations include: •  creating a Social Media Health Alliance, funded by a 0.5% tax on the profits of social media companies, to fund research and draw up clearer guidance for the public •  establishing a duty of care on all social media companies with registered UK users aged 24 and under •  reviewing whether the ""addictive"" nature of social media is sufficient to classify it as an official disease •  commissioning robust research into understanding how social media affects young people's mental health The report, written with the Royal Society for Public Health, says companies like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube were starting to address health harms, but there was still room for improvement. Chris Elmore MP, chair of the APPG on Social Media and Young People's Mental Health and Wellbeing said the report was a wake-up call for meaningful action. ""For far too long social media companies have been allowed to operate in an online 'wild west'.  ""And it is in this lawless landscape that our children currently work and play online. This cannot continue. As the report makes clear, now is the time for the government to take action."" Shirley Cramer CBE, chief executive of RSPH, said the priority was regulation, and a duty of care to protect vulnerable users in a ""lawless digital playground"". She also said she wanted to see industry supporting further research to improve our understanding of the health harms, as well as the benefits, from social media. ""We hope that our findings are recognised and included in the forthcoming White Paper from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport so that we can empower our young people to manage their relationship with social media in a way that protects and promotes their mental health and wellbeing,"" Ms Cramer said. A government spokeswoman said: ""The government will soon publish a White Paper which will set out the responsibilities of online platforms, how these responsibilities should be met and what would happen if they are not. ""An internet regulator, statutory 'duty of care' on platforms, and a levy on social media companies are all measures we are considering as part of our work.""",,,,

Well now you might have an official reason as to why you're not acting like a mature adult. People don't become fully ""adult"" until they're in their 30s, according to brain scientists. Currently the UK law says you become a mature adult when you reach the age of 18. Scientists who study the brain and nervous system say the age at which you become an adult is different for everyone. Research suggests people aged 18 are still going through changes in the brain which can affect behaviour and make them more likely to develop mental health disorders. Professor Peter Jones, from Cambridge University, said: ""What we're really saying is that to have a definition of when you move from childhood to adulthood looks increasingly absurd. ""It's a much more nuanced transition that takes place over three decades."" He added: ""I guess systems like the education system, the health system and the legal system make it convenient for themselves by having definitions."" When you reach 18, you can vote, buy alcohol, get a mortgage and are also treated as an adult if you get in trouble with the police. Despite this, Professor Jones says he believes experienced criminal judges recognise the difference between a 19-year-old defendant and a ""hardened criminal"" in their late 30s. ""I think the system is adapting to what's hiding in plain sight, that people don't like (the idea of) a caterpillar turning into a butterfly,"" he said. ""There isn't a childhood and then an adulthood. People are on a pathway, they're on a trajectory.""

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47624856,"The resort city of Palma in Majorca is restricting alcohol in some popular areas, including the beach, in a drive against drunk tourists. Police will be able to fine them up to €3,000 (£2,565; $3,406) for anti-social behaviour from 1 April.  Bars, clubs or restaurants breaking the rules can also be fined. They must not promote any drinking in the street. In the most popular waterfront areas of Palma de Mallorca there will be no more happy hours or two-for-one offers.  Majorca has long been a magnet for young German and British tourists, who often drink heavily and enjoy rowdy late-night clubbing.  The neighbouring island of Ibiza also has a reputation for hard-drinking young partygoers from Northern Europe. Alexandra Wilms, spokeswoman for the Balearic Tourism Ministry, said the two main hotspots for anti-social heavy drinking were Playa de Palma - the long beach east of Palma - and Magaluf, 18km (11 miles) southwest of the city. The new restrictions, imposed by city hall, apply to Playa de Palma and four central zones in Palma, but not Magaluf. Read more on similar topics: Last year there were at least 15 cases of drunk tourists falling from balconies in Majorca - and in eight cases the falls were fatal. Most involved British tourists in Magaluf. In Palma, Ms Wilms told the BBC, ""local people have been complaining for years that something has to be done"".  ""The problem is drunken tourists gathering and fighting in the street - locals wake up and see vomit, litter, broken glass."" Last summer Palma introduced a ban on flat owners renting their apartments to travellers without a permit from the Balearic Tourism Ministry. Tourism accounts for 42% of the Balearic islands' economic output (GDP), Ms Wilms said, and there is a drive now to promote ""better-quality tourism, for people who want to enjoy the area, the culture - not just coming to get drunk on the beach"".  Spanish media report that tourism to the Balearics has grown in recent years: in 2017 the islands hosted 16 million tourists, half of them from Germany and the UK. That was 6.3% more than in 2016, which had been a record year. For Majorca alone in 2017 the total of tourists was 11.6m, of whom 4.4m were Germans and 2.3m were British, a Balearics economic website reports (in Spanish). Tourism to Ibiza and Menorca is dominated by the British. In Magaluf many hotels have carried out major refurbishments in recent years, partly to attract more upmarket tourists.  Spain's El Mundo daily says Balearic hotel businesses have invested €1.5bn in renovations in the past seven years. The tourism ministry is ""creating products for the tourism we want - such as gastronomic experiences - and cultural visits are being expanded"", Ms Wilms said. The challenge now is to spread tourism more evenly throughout the year, she said, as the peak summer season is already filling Majorca's hotel rooms.  A more even spread of tourism would also create longer - not just seasonal - contracts for hotel and restaurant workers, she said.",,,,

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47630529,"Most patients seeking medicinal cannabis on the NHS will not be able to get it soon, despite recent changes in regulation that allow doctors to give it, a committee has heard.  England's Chief Medical Officer called for robust scientific trials to check safety. These trials can last years. Families with children with severe epilepsy have been campaigning for greater access.  Campaigners say they have been let down. Towards the end of 2018 cannabis was reclassified to allow some cannabis-derived medicines to be prescribed by specialist doctors in limited situations. Currently medicinal cannabis is mostly unlicensed - meaning doctors can only prescribe it in extreme circumstances, and many are reluctant to do so without more guidance and solid evidence.  The regulatory change came after a review by England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, who concluded that there were some clinical benefits to medicinal cannabis products.  The Health and Social Care Select Committee heard that this move raised the expectations of some patients and families who had hoped to be prescribed the products.  Speaking at the committee, Dame Sally said it was now time to build up lots of evidence from 'gold standard' scientific studies - so that the products could be considered for licensing and moved to ""their rightful place in medicine."" She called for industry to play a leading role in funding these trials.  Peter Carroll, of the campaign group End Our Pain, said he was ""shocked and horrified"" that few patients had benefited so far - including children with severe epilepsy, whose parents were currently sourcing the drugs elsewhere.  He said waiting years for randomised control trials to finish was ""absurd"". He argued that there needed to be a broader view of evidence - including the experiences of multiple families. Speaking at the committee, Prof Mike Barnes, Chair of the Medical Cannabis Clinicians' Society, said standard pharmaceutical trials could not be easily applied to cannabis, as it is not a single molecule that can be compared to a placebo or a dummy pill.  He said a range of approaches needed to be taken when considering the evidence.  The health watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, is expected to issue guidelines to specialist doctors in October.  The NHS will use this to decide whether it will eventually fund the drug routinely for some patients.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47609849,"Smoking potent 'skunk-like' cannabis increases your risk of serious mental illness, say researchers.  They estimate around one in 10 new cases of psychosis may be associated with strong cannabis, based on their study of European cities and towns. In London and Amsterdam, where most of the cannabis that is sold is very strong, the risk could be much more, they say in The Lancet Psychiatry. Daily use of any cannabis also makes psychosis more likely, they found. Experts say people should be aware of the potential risks to health, even though the study is not definitive proof of harm.  Lead researcher and psychiatrist Dr Marta Di Forti said: ""If you decide to use high potency cannabis bear in mind there is this potential risk."" Dr Adrian James from the Royal College of Psychiatrists said: ""This is a good quality study and the results need to be taken seriously."" People experiencing psychosis lose touch with reality, and may hear voices, see things that are not actually there or have delusional, confused thoughts. It is a recognised medical condition and different to getting high on a drug.  There is disagreement as to what extent cannabis might cause or worsen mental health problems and many countries have gone ahead and legalised or decriminalised cannabis use.  Doctors are concerned about the growing use of high potency cannabis that contains lots of the ingredient THC - the one that gives the high. Skunk-like cannabis with a THC content of 14% now makes up 94% of the drug sold on the streets of London, according to experts. Ad Gridley, who currently takes three different anti-psychotics, has suffered with schizophrenia and has tried to take his own life. He believes his psychosis is down to cannabis use. He no longer smokes. ""I was smoking so much it was common place for me to be stoned, and I started doing it a lot by myself too. After a couple of suicide attempts - that I didn't really admit to - my mum saw me at home in my flat hugging my knees, rocking, and she knew immediately something was wrong,"" he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""Within 24 hours there was a GP out, and I was in hospital the next day. It plagued my life for about ten years after that. I couldn't function, and I was in and out of hospital ten times. I wasn't doing anything meaningful with my life. ""When I stopped, the psychosis stopped. I was on medications and things but that was to rectify what happened before, so my brain chemistry could get some sort of equilibrium. When I stopped smoking, the symptoms disappeared. ""If I had known the risks I doubt I would have taken it."" The researchers, from King's College London, looked at cannabis use by people in 11 EU towns and cities, including London, as well as one region of Brazil.  They compared a sample of 901 people who had experienced psychosis with 1,237 (from the general population) who had not.  They categorised the type of cannabis used by the participants according to strength, although they did not do any lab tests to measure the strength directly.  Low potency cannabis was any illicit product thought to contain less than 10% concentration of the ingredient THC. High potency was anything containing more than 10% THC.  The researchers found: The authors estimate that one in five new cases (20.4%) of psychosis across the 11 sites may be linked to daily cannabis use, and one in ten (12.2%) linked to use of high potency cannabis.  In London, a fifth (21%) of new cases of psychosis might be linked to daily cannabis use, and nearly a third (30%) to high potency cannabis. Removing strong cannabis from the market would lower London's psychosis incidence rate from 45.7 to 31.9 cases per 100,000 people per year, the scientists estimate.  For the South London region they looked at, that would mean 60 fewer cases of psychosis each year.  Nick Hickmott from the drug and alcohol charity Addaction said: ""We've got a problem with potency. People who regularly take lots of high strength cannabis are at risk of potentially serious harm. It can be particularly harmful for younger, developing brains. ""My advice is avoid using high-strength cannabis every day and pay attention to how it makes you feel. If you end up feeling anxious or just unsettled then it might be best to give it a miss. It's also not a good idea to mix it with alcohol or other drugs.  ""It's also important not to over-react. Lots of people experiment with cannabis and then move on without any problems. For people who do need advice or help I'd recommend reaching out to a GP or a local drug service."" Cannabis can vary in strength and type. Skunk tends to contain higher levels of THC than weed.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-47627179,"A Scottish woman who astonished doctors with her ability to detect Parkinson's disease through smell has helped scientists find what causes the odour. Researchers in Manchester said they had identified the molecules on the skin linked to the smell and hope it could lead to early detection. The study was inspired by Joy Milne, a 68-year-old retired nurse from Perth. She first noticed the ""musky"" smell on her husband Les, who was years later diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.   Joy, who has worked with the University of Manchester on the research for three years, has been named in a paper being published in the journal ACS Central Science.  She has also been made an honorary lecturer at the university because of her efforts to help identify the telltale smell. The research revealed that a number of compounds, particularly hippuric acid, eicosane, and octadecanal, were found in higher than usual concentrations on the skin of Parkinson's patients. They are contained in sebum - the oily secretion that coats everybody's skin, but which is often produced in greater quantity by people with Parkinson's, making them more likely to develop a skin complaint called seborrheic dermatitis. Lead author Prof Perdita Barran, from the school of chemistry at the University of Manchester, told BBC Scotland: ""What we found are some compounds that are more present in people who have got Parkinson's disease and the reason we've discovered them is because Joy Milne could smell a difference.  ""She could smell people who've got Parkinson's disease.  ""So we designed some experiments to mimic what Joy does, to use a mass spectrometer to do what Joy can do when she smells these things on people with Parkinson's."" One in 500 people in the UK has Parkinson's and that rises to about one in 100 among the over-60s. It can leave them struggling to walk, speak and sleep. Currently there is no cure and no definitive test for the disease, with clinicians diagnosing patients by observing symptoms. Prof Barran said she hoped the ""volatile biomarkers"" they identified could lead to a simple early detection test for the disease, such as wiping a person's neck with a swab and testing for the signature molecules. She said: ""What we might hope is if we can diagnose people earlier, before the motor symptoms come in, that there will be treatments that can prevent the disease spreading. So that's really the ultimate ambition."" Joy's husband Les, who died in 2015, was told he had Parkinson's at the age of 45 but Joy said she detected the unusual musky smell about a decade earlier. The retired nurse only linked the odour to the disease after meeting people with the same distinctive smell at a Parkinson's UK support group. She told BBC Scotland that not knowing Les had Parkinson's put her family in a ""negative spiral"". ""What if we did know?,"" she said  ""It would have changed things dramatically. ""The fact that he became withdrawn, reserved, he had bouts of depression and mood swings, if I had understood what was happening it would have changed our total outlook on life.""",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47633086,"A US jury has found that one of the world's most widely-used weedkillers was a ""substantial factor"" in causing a man's cancer. Pharmaceutical group Bayer had strongly rejected claims that its glyphosate-based Roundup product was carcinogenic.  But the jury in San Francisco ruled unanimously that it contributed to causing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in California resident Edwin Hardeman. The next stage of the trial will consider Bayer's liability and damages. During this phase, which starts on Wednesday, Mr Hardeman's lawyers are expected to present evidence allegedly showing Bayer's efforts to influence scientists, regulators and the public about the safety of its products. In morning trading, Bayer's shares immediately plunged, dropping almost 12% to €61.62. The German company, which acquired Roundup as part of its $66bn takeover of US rival Monsanto, said it was disappointed with the jury's initial decision. ""We are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto's conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman's cancer,"" the company said. Bayer continues ""to believe firmly that science confirms that glyphosate-based herbicides do not cause cancer"". The case was only the second of some 11,200 Roundup lawsuits to go to trial in the US. Another California man was awarded $289m in August after a state court jury found Roundup caused his cancer, sending Bayer shares plunging at the time.  That award was later reduced to $78m and is on appeal. Bayer has argued that decades of studies and regulatory assessments have shown the weed killer to be safe for human use. Mr Hardeman, 70, treated his property in Sonoma County, California, regularly with the herbicide from 1980 to 2012 and was eventually diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His lawyers Aimee Wagstaff and Jennifer Moore said in a joint statement their client was ""pleased"" with the decision. ""Now we can focus on the evidence that Monsanto has not taken a responsible, objective approach to the safety of Roundup,"" they added.  ""Instead, it is clear from Monsanto's actions that it does not particularly care whether its product is in fact giving people cancer, focusing instead on manipulating public opinion and undermining anyone who raises genuine and legitimate concerns about the issue."" Another Roundup trial is scheduled to begin in California state court in Oakland on 28 March, involving a couple who claim Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Glyphosate was introduced by Monsanto in 1974, but its patent expired in 2000, and now the chemical is sold by various manufacturers. In the US, more than 750 products contain it. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the World Health Organisation's cancer agency, concluded that glyphosate was ""probably carcinogenic to humans"".  However, the US Environmental Protection Agency insists it is safe when used carefully. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also says glyphosate is unlikely to cause cancer in humans. In November 2017 EU countries voted to renew the licence of glyphosate despite campaigns against it.   In California - where a judge had ruled that coffee must carry a cancer warning - the agriculture industry sued to prevent such a label for glyphosate, even though  the state lists it as a chemical known to cause cancer.",,,,

Another is John Starbrook, who at 87 became the oldest runner to complete the 2018 London Marathon. Studies suggest regular exercise is more effective than any drug yet invented to prevent conditions facing older people, such as muscle loss.  To reap the full benefits, this pattern of behaviour should be laid down in a person's teens and early 20s. Studying master athletes - sportspeople aged 35 and over - gives us an idea of what is physically possible as we age. Analysing the world record performance times of each age group unsurprisingly reveals that physical ability does ultimately diminish, the older you get - but doesn't fall off rapidly until after the age of 70. It is reasonable to assume these top athletes have a healthy lifestyle in general; as well as exercising, they follow a balanced diet and don't smoke or drink heavily. So their results can help us determine how much of this decline is due to the ageing process itself. The greater health of older exercisers compared to their sedentary counterparts can lead people to believe physical activity can reverse or slow down the ageing process. But the reality is that these active older people are exactly as they should be. In our distant past we were hunter-gatherers, and our bodies are designed to be physically active.  So, if an active 80-year-old has a similar physiology to an inactive 50-year-old, it is the younger person who appears older than they should be, not the other way around. We often confuse the effects of inactivity with the ageing process itself, and believe certain diseases are purely the result of getting older. Actually, our modern sedentary lifestyles have simply speeded up our underlying age-related decline. This contributes to the onset of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.  Many of us are simply not active enough. In England fewer than half of 16-24 year olds meet the recommendation for aerobic and muscle strengthening exercises; for 65-74 year-olds, it falls to fewer than one in 10. Not only does exercise help prevent the onset of many diseases, it can also help to cure or alleviate others, improving our quality of life. Recent studies of recreational cyclists aged 55-79 suggest they have the capacity to do everyday tasks very easily and efficiently because nearly all parts of their body are in remarkably good condition. The cyclists also scored highly on tests measuring mental agility, mental health and quality of life. The younger you start exercising the better.  Analysis of American adults aged 50-71 found those who had exercised between two and eight hours a week from their teens through to their 60s, had a 29-36% lower chance of dying from any cause over the 20-year study period.  The study suggests active young people should keep their activity levels up, but also that those aged 40 and above may be able to become more physically active and reap similar benefits.  In today's world we have largely been able to get away with problems related to our inactivity, by leaning on the crutch of modern medicine for support.   But while our average life expectancy has increased quite rapidly, our ""healthspan"" - the period of life we can enjoy free from disease - has not.  Many benefiting from projected life expectancy increases by 2035 will spend their extra years with four diseases or more, according to a study in England.     While pharmaceuticals are improving all the time, exercise can do things that medicine cannot. For example, there is currently no drug available that can protect against loss of muscle mass and strength, the biggest factor in our loss of physical function. Being more active is not only better for an individual, it is also vital for the functioning of our wider society as it ages. In 2018, almost one in five Britons were over 65, while one in 40 were over 85.   The number of people aged 65 and over is projected to rise by more than 40% in the next 16 years. The average 85-year-old costs the NHS more than five times as much as a 30-year-old, analysis suggests. More stories like this Most people should not be aiming to become a world-beating athlete in their advanced years; they don't need to be to reach optimal health.   Instead, incorporating small regular bouts of physical activity - brisk walking or ballroom dancing - into your routine is the key. Physical activity is one of the cornerstones of a healthy life.  Even if you can't be a competitive athlete, starting to regularly exercise in your 20s and 30s is likely to pay off later on. And if you're past that point, just gently becoming active will do a huge amount of good.

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47636176,"Officials in San Francisco have proposed a new law to ban e-cigarette sales until their health effects are evaluated by the US government. The law appears to be the first of its kind in the US and seeks to curb a rising usage by young people. Critics, however, say it will make it harder for people to kick addiction. A second city law would bar making, selling or distributing tobacco on city property and is aimed at an e-cigarette firm renting on Pier 70. Last week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - the national regulator - released its proposed guidelines, giving companies until 2021 to apply to have their e-cigarette products evaluated. A deadline had initially been set for August 2018, but the agency later said more preparation time was needed. San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera, one of the co-authors of the bill, which is yet to be approved, said reviews should have been done before they were sold.  ""These companies may hide behind the veneer of harm reduction, but let's be clear, their product is addiction,"" said Mr Herrera. He added that San Francisco, Chicago and New York had sent a joint letter to the FDA calling on it to investigate the effects of e-cigarettes on public health. Anti-vaping activists say companies are deliberately targeting young people by offering flavoured products. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of US teenagers who admitted using tobacco products ""within the last 30 days"" rose 36% between 2017 and 2018 - from 3.6m to 4.9m. It attributes this to a growth in e-cigarette use. Last year San Francisco became the first US city to ban flavoured tobacco and vaping liquids, and already prevents smokeless tobacco from being used on playing fields. Juul, one of the the most popular US e-cigarette firms, rents space on Pier 70. In a statement, the firm said it supported cutting vaping among young people but only in a way that eliminated access to regular cigarettes. It asked: ""This proposed legislation begs the question - why would the city be comfortable with combustible cigarettes being on shelves when we know they kill more than 480,000 Americans per year?""",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47640359,"New rules to reduce naturally high testosterone levels in female athletes have been branded ""unscientific"". Last year, athletics chiefs ruled women with levels of five nanomoles per litre or more must have hormone treatment before being allowed to compete. But experts, reporting in the British Medical Journal, say there is a lack of evidence about testosterone's effects and the cut-off figure is arbitrary. A decision on the legality of the rules is expected later this month. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) delayed implementing its regulations after South African runner Caster Semenya contested the legality of the new rules. She was banned from international competitions for nearly a year for having testosterone levels above the athletics body's limit for female athletes. World athletics bosses have previously said they want to protect the sanctity of fair and open competition. Writing in an editorial in the BMJ, Dr Sheree Bekker, from the University of Bath, and Prof Cara Tannenbaum, from the University of Montreal, say the IAAF's regulations risked ""setting an unscientific precedent for other cases of genetic advantage"". ""The medical profession does not define biological sex or physical function by serum testosterone levels alone,"" they say. And they warned that the proposed rules could have ""far reaching implications"" on individuals and societies. Dr Bekker and Prof Tannenbaum argue that testosterone levels vary naturally in men and women, with higher averages among elite athletes. But there is also a big crossover between men and women, with 16% of men classified as having low testosterone and 14% of women having high, according to some definitions. They say testosterone is just one indicator of sports performance and many other factors also play a role. ""If more science is needed... then call for health research organisations to deliver on this mandate,"" they say. ""History compels us to ensure that decisions about genetic superiority are supported by objective, rigorous and reproducible data."" The writers take issue with an analysis commissioned by the IAAF to quantify the relationship between high levels of testosterone and performance, because the results ""could not be independently reproduced"". Prof Peter Sonksen, professor of endocrinology at St Thomas's Hospital and King's College and visiting professor at the University of Southampton, agreed that the IAAF's proposed new rules were not ""fit for purpose"". ""It is not compatible with the science behind the issues and greatly overestimates the role of endogenous testosterone,"" he said. ""It is also personal and unfairly targets a brilliant athlete."" However, Prof Chris Cooper, emeritus professor of biochemistry at the University of Essex, said it was important not to get hung up on criticising the fine details of science that was never going to be conclusive. ""In my opinion, the current evidence is as good as we are going to get to show that both endogenous [natural] and exogenous [doped] testosterone levels enhance female sports performance,"" he said. ""Of course a lot of other factors, genetic and environmental, also affect sports performance but that is a separate story.""",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47631079,"Scientists say they have made a significant leap towards helping boys with cancer stay fertile, thanks to a baby monkey called Grady. Cancer treatment can damage a boy's undeveloped testes and leaves a third of survivors infertile in adulthood.  Baby Grady is the first primate born using frozen samples of testicles taken before her dad started puberty.  Experts said the technique, detailed in the journal Science, could soon be used in the clinic. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can destroy someone's ability to have children.  Women and girls can have eggs or ovaries frozen in order to have children after their cancer therapy is over. Adult men can have a sperm sample frozen, but this is not an option for boys who have not gone through puberty.  Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development started with five male rhesus macaques. The animals had not started puberty so their testes were not yet sperm-making factories.  Then the researchers removed a testicle from each monkey, cut it up into small pieces and put the fragments on ice to cryopreserve them.  Around half a year later the monkeys were made infertile. Then fragments of their preserved testes were thawed and were grafted underneath the monkey's skin.  As the animals went through puberty, the testicular tissue matured and grew; when scientists looked inside ""we found that there were sperm"", said Prof Kyle Orwig, from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. This sperm was used to fertilise an egg and baby girl Grady was the result.  Just over eight out of every 10 testicular tissue grafts started producing sperm after the macaques went through puberty.  The researchers then fertilised 138 eggs using a technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection or ICSI.    Around four in 10 fertilised eggs developed into early stage embryos. A total of 11 embryos were implanted into female macaques, which resulted in one pregnancy and one healthy baby.  The scientists think it is close. Prof Orwig said: ""Having succeeded to produce a live-born and healthy baby, we feel that this is a technology that is ready for the human clinic."" But other researchers say they would like to see more evidence before it is tried on humans for the first time. Some boys have already had testicular tissue frozen in the hope that science would one day give them the option of having children.  The biggest risk would be giving the child cancer again.  If any cancerous material was hidden inside the testes, then it too would be frozen and reintroduced to the child's body along with the graft. Cancers of the blood - like leukaemia and lymphoma - as well as testicular cancer, would be problematic. Doctors would also want to be sure that the process did not affect the genetic material packaged up inside the sperm.  Dr Susan Taymans, from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, told the BBC: ""I think it is very significant. ""It is a very exciting proof of principle that this really can work, but there's a few more things I'd like to see. ""This is one live healthy baby, which is fantastic, but I think we'd like to see a couple more."" She also said: ""I'm hopeful boys whose tissue has been frozen will be able to use it in their lifetime."" Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, said: ""This is a really excellent study, which is a great step forward, but it is important to remember that before we could attempt to use it in humans, further research would be needed to show that it is safe and that it works in the same kind of way.  ""This, I think, is still a number of years away."" Follow James on Twitter.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47638608,"Researchers have produced unprecedented images of a baby's heart while it is still inside the womb. Pregnant women were scanned in an MRI machine and powerful computers built 3D models of the tiny beating hearts inside their unborn children.  The team at King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas's says it will improve the care of babies with congenital heart disease.  The researchers say their approach could easily be adopted by hospitals. Violet-Vienna developed life-threatening abnormalities in the blood vessels around her heart while she was still inside her mother. Problems were first detected when Kirbi-Lea Pettitt went for a routine ultrasound scan 20 weeks into her pregnancy.  She then took part in the study to look at her baby's heart in vivid detail.  It showed a narrowing of the main artery coming from the heart - the aorta - which would block the blood vessel after birth. Her daughter also had two holes in her heart. ""It was very scary, I was just shell-shocked really,"" Kirbi-Lea told the BBC. But it allowed doctors to plan how to save Violet-Vienna's life after she arrived in the world.  ""I wasn't allowed to hold her, they had to take her straight away to put her on medication to keep her aorta open,"" said Kirbi-Lea. Her baby had heart surgery a week later, but after a tricky start is now a healthy 11-month-old.  Kirbi-Lea said: ""She's doted on by everyone and she's just thriving - and it's all down to these specialists and this technology.  ""It's amazing what they do, it's lifesaving."" A series of 2D pictures of the heart are taken from different angles using an MRI machine.  But the foetal heart is tiny, beats incredibly quickly, and the baby moves around inside the womb so the images of the heart look like a fuzzy blur. But then comes the really clever bit.  Sophisticated computer software pieces the images together, adjusts for the beating of the heart and then builds an unprecedented 3D image of the heart. It gives doctors a clear view of the abnormality. Congenital heart diseases affect up to eight in every 1,000 babies born in the UK. They can be caused by infections and some medicines, and can run in families.  Prof Reza Razavi, consultant paediatric cardiologist, wanted to improve the diagnosis of the birth defects after his daughter was born with one. ""We thought we were going to lose her, that was a strong motivator... we should be able to pick up the problem in the womb.""  He describes the 3D images as ""beautiful"" and says they let doctors clearly see the problem and improve care.  He told the BBC: ""We can have complete certainty and plan ahead what treatment is needed, what's the operation we need to do.  ""It really helps the parents to have the right support to know what's going to happen.  ""But it also really helps the babies because they get the right operation at the right time and have the best outcomes.""  The study, published in the Lancet, shows the 3D imaging worked in 85 pregnant women, but has now been tested on more than 200 patients.   Dr David Lloyd, a clinical research fellow at King's College London, said: ""Our hope is this approach will now become standard practice for the Evelina foetal cardiology team, who make a prenatal diagnosis in 400 babies each year.  ""This will also improve the care of over 150 babies each year who deliver at St Thomas's Hospital with known congenital heart disease."" He says the technology would be easy to adopt if a hospital already has an MRI machine, because the only new equipment needed would be a computer with a decent graphics card.  The research is part of the iFind project to increase the number of health problems picked up during standard pregnancy scans.  If they are diagnosed only after birth then vital time can be lost in trying to make a diagnosis.  Another approach is to use four ultrasound probes at the same time - current scans use one - to get a more detailed picture.  Follow James on Twitter.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47687131,"A five-month-old boy has died after parents performed a circumcision at their home in Italy, officials say. The baby was sent to a Bologna hospital in cardiac arrest on Friday night, but died shortly afterwards. Authorities in the northern Reggio Emilia province have opened an investigation against the parents, who are reported to be of Ghanaian origin. In a similar case, a two-year-old boy died after a failed circumcision at a migrant centre in Rome in December.  Some 5,000 circumcisions are performed in Italy each year but more than a third are carried out illegally, according to health charity Amsi. Circumcision is not carried out at public health institutions in the Roman Catholic country. Many of the country's immigrants come from Muslim countries where circumcision is commonplace. By Michelle Roberts, BBC News Online health editor Although it is a relatively simple medical procedure, circumcision is not entirely risk-free.  Doctors may recommend that a man or boy is circumcised if he has an unusually tight foreskin, known as phimosis, or suffers from recurrent infections of the foreskin and penis, known as balanitis. There is also some evidence that men who are circumcised have a lower risk of contracting HIV from HIV-positive female partners. It is not clear if circumcision reduces the risk of other sexually transmitted infections too, but studies suggest it may lower the chance of catching genital warts caused by a family of viruses called HPV. The main risks of the surgery are bleeding and infection.  In the UK, the chance of these occurring is between one in 10 and one in 50, according to the NHS website, although that is a figure for older boys and men, not newborns. Circumcision is legal throughout Europe, although the practice is becoming more controversial. A court in Germany passed a local ban in 2012 after the circumcision of a four-year-old Muslim boy led to complications, with the judge saying it ""permanently and irreparably changed"" the body.  However, the German government later that year clarified that the procedure is legal provided it is performed by trained practitioners. The following year, the Council of Europe recommended countries take steps to ensure good medical and sanitary practices when performing a circumcision.  And in the UK in 2016, a court ruled that a Muslim father could not have his sons circumcised after their mother disagreed.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47692495,"People keep making new brain cells throughout their lives (well at least until the age of 97), according to a study on human brains.  The idea has been fiercely debated, and it used to be thought we were born with all the brain cells we will ever have.  The researchers at the University of Madrid also showed that the number of new brain cells tailed off with age.   And it falls dramatically in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease - giving new ideas for treating the dementia.  Most of our neurons - brain cells that send electrical signals - are indeed in place by the time we are born.  Studies on other mammals have found new brains cells forming later in life, but the extent of ""neurogenesis"" in the human brain is still a source of debate.  The study, published in Nature Medicine, looked at the brains of 58 deceased people who were aged between 43 and 97. The focus was on the hippocampus - a part of the brain involved in memory and emotion. It is the part of the brain that you need, to remember where you parked the car. Neurons do not emerge in the brain fully formed, but have to go through a process of growing and maturing.  The researchers were able to spot immature or ""new"" neurons in the brains that they examined.  In healthy brains there was a ""slight decrease"" in the amount of this neurogenesis with age. Researcher Dr Maria Llorens-Martin told BBC News: ""I believe we would be generating new neurons as long as we need to learn new things. ""And that occurs during every single second of our life."" But there was a different story in the brains from Alzheimer's patients.  The number of new neurons forming fell from 30,000 per millimetre to 20,000 per millimetre in people at the beginning of Alzheimer's. Dr Llorens-Martin said: ""That's a 30% reduction in the very first stage of the disease. ""It's very surprising for us, it's even before the accumulation of amyloid beta [a hallmark of Alzheimer's] and probably before symptoms, it's very early."" Alzheimer's disease remains untreatable, but the main focus of research has been targeting clumps of amyloid beta in the brain.  However, even last week more trials using this approach have failed and the latest study suggests there may be something happening even earlier in the course of the disease.  Dr Llorens-Martin says understanding why there is a decrease in neurogenesis could lead to new treatments in both Alzheimer's and normal ageing.  But she says the next stage of research will probably require looking in the brains of people while they are still alive, to see what is happening over time.  Dr Rosa Sancho, the head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""While we start losing nerve cells in early adulthood, this research shows that we can continue to produce new ones even into our 90s. ""Alzheimer's radically accelerates the rate at which we lose nerve cells and this research provides convincing evidence that it also limits the creation of new nerve cells.  ""Larger studies will need to confirm these findings and explore whether they could pave the way for an early test to flag those most at risk of the disease."" Follow James on Twitter.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47694760,"Coroners in England and Wales may be given new powers to investigate stillbirths, so that each baby death is independently assessed. The government is consulting on the move to help bereaved parents gain answers on what went wrong and why and to help prevent more baby deaths.  Nine babies are stillborn every day in the UK. That's one in every 225 births, although rates have been going down. In many cases, doctors are unable to tell parents why their baby died.  Currently, coroners can hold inquests only for babies who have shown signs of life after being born. When a pregnancy that appeared to be healthy ends in stillbirth, the hospital caring for the mother will investigate.  A safety investigation body funded by the Department of Health and Social Care may look into it too. While many parents are satisfied with existing processes, some have raised concerns about the inconsistency of investigations and have called for a more transparent and independent system.  Under the proposed new system that ministers are consulting on: The joint consultation, from the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Health and Social Care, wants to hear a wide range of views, from bereaved parents and the organisations that support them, as well as health professionals.  Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price said: ""We want to do everything we can to make pregnancy safer, by continually learning to improve the care on offer so fewer people have to experience the terrible tragedy of losing a child and those who do get the answers and support they deserve."" Justice Minister Edward Argar said: ""Although we have robust processes in place at the moment to investigate stillbirths, we think we can go further and we should go further.  ""The use of coroners to investigate them in an open and transparent way would not only help bring closure to families who have suffered this tragedy but would also help us to learn lessons for the future to help further reduce the number of stillbirths.""

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-47695169,"Breast ironing awareness should be made part of the mandatory school curriculum to protect young girls from abuse, the National Education Union has said. The practice involves ironing a girl's chest with hot objects to delay breasts from growing, so she does not attract male attention. Conservative MP Nicky Morgan said teachers must also be educated, as they have a ""very important role to play"". The Home Office said teachers have a duty to report concerns. ""Kinaya"" - whose name we have changed - lives in the UK. Her family descends from west Africa - where breast ironing originates - and she was subjected to it aged 10. She said her mother told her that ""if I don't iron them, men will start coming to you, to have sex with you"". It is often the child's mother who will undertake the breast ironing, which usually involves heating a stone or spoon on a flame then pressing, massaging or flattening the breast.  This can go on for months. ""Time does not erase that kind of pain,"" Kinaya explained. ""You're not even allowed to cry out. If you do, you [are said to] have brought shame to your family, you are not a 'strong girl'."" Kinaya is now an adult with daughters of her own. When her eldest turned 10, her mother proposed that she be breast ironed. ""I said, 'No, no, no, none of my children are going to go through what I went through, as I still live with the trauma."" She has since moved away from her family, believing there was a real risk they would have performed breast ironing on her daughters without her consent. It is thought that around 1,000 girls in the UK have been affected by breast ironing. But while awareness is growing around female genital mutilation (FGM), there are fears that few people know about breast ironing. One woman told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she only realised breast ironing was not normal when she discovered her body looked different to her classmates during a PE class at her UK school, which led her to become distressed. Her sister had breast ironed her from age eight, but her teachers failed to notice when she became withdrawn and stopped wanting to take part in PE lessons. ""If my PE teacher had known, if they were trained, I could have had the help I needed growing up,"" she said. Kiri Tunks, joint president of the National Education Union, is now calling for school staff - and in particular PE teachers - to be taught how to notice the signs. She also wants it to be covered in schools in the same way as FGM will be from 2020, as part of compulsory relationships and sex education classes in secondary schools. Ms Morgan said issues such as breast ironing should be ""tackled, addressed, talked about and stopped"". She added that the curriculum should be kept ""under review as different areas of practice, custom or abuse come to light"". Those working with girls and young women should also be taught to recognise that breast ironing is taking place in the UK, she continued, and to be able to ""advise the young person on what action they need to take"". One woman, ""Simone"", told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was breast ironed aged 13 when her mum found out that she was gay. ""According to her, maybe I was attractive because of my breasts, so if she can iron them and I'm flat, then maybe I'll be ugly and no-one will admire me."" In her case, the breast ironing went on for months. Like many young girls, she was also made to wear an extremely tight strap around her chest to suppress them even more - which caused her difficulty breathing. A few years later, when she had a baby to the man she was forced to marry, the long-term damage became apparent. ""When it comes to breast feeding, it's so strenuous, like there's a knot inside,"" she explained. ""It seemed like maybe some of the nerves were destroyed."" There is no specific offence for breast ironing, but the Home Office described it as a form of child abuse and said it should be prosecuted under general assault laws.  Angie Marriott, a former gynaecological nurse who now works as a safeguarding lecturer for Cheshire Police, said that the true scale of breast ironing in the UK was being obscured because of under-reporting. She described it as a ""sensitive, hidden crime"", with women afraid to speak out for fear of being ""ousted from their communities"". ""I know this is happening because people have divulged it to me,"" she said. ""And they've said it's the first time openly that they've ever spoken about what's happened to them, and they felt ashamed."" Simone still bears the scars from the abuse she endured, and wants to raise awareness of the crime.   ""To say the least, it's an abuse. It hurts, it dehumanises you,"" she said. ""You are not a human being.""  Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-47619176,"Stuffing your hand into the fleshy slime of someone's stomach on an operating table is going to grab anyone's attention. Even if it's a replica, this grimly authentic representation of surgery following a knife attack is going to stay in the memory. That's the point of this simulation, created by a group of medical staff at Imperial College London. These doctors want to make young people really understand the consequences of stabbing someone. They want to show that a knife attack doesn't finish when the ambulance doors slam shut and the blue lights pull away. And they want health services not only to treat victims but to intervene to make stabbings less likely in the first place. So, they've created an immersive role play for teenagers, getting them to stuff swabs around the organs and look for injuries below the peeled-back skin of this anatomical model. Wearing operating theatre masks and gowns, and surrounded by screens and monitors, the participants have to hunt through the guts and gore to find where a blade has caused damage. The other people taking part are real surgeons, from the Imperial College Centre for Engagement and Simulation Science, headed by Prof Roger Kneebone. ""It's absolutely about public health,"" says Prof Kneebone, and his team is taking this simulation into schools and places where teenagers are likely to gather.  The priority is to make young people think before picking up a knife - by showing how a split-second stabbing can end a life or have consequences that last a lifetime. ""We want people to see there is a choice. The simulation allows you to replay it - and to show there can be different outcomes,"" Prof Kneebone says. And the ""physicality of the experience"" can make much more of an impact than conventional talks and advice. ""It's not a new problem, it's not just a London problem, but people are coming in at a younger age,"" says Sacha Harris, part of the project and a trauma surgeon at St Mary's Hospital in west London. He says the hospital now sees about one young victim of a knife attack each day. An unintended advantage of this is that surgeons have become much more practised in responding to knife wounds and that trainee surgeons know more about the types of injuries from different weapons and entry points. Prof Kneebone once worked as a surgeon in Soweto, South Africa, and says it was plagued by knife injuries but as a result victims had the benefit of some of the most experienced and skilled medical staff. Dr Harris says the stab wounds also seem to have become less random.  ""There is a pattern of attacks. They know where to attack if they want to avoid killing. They know how to inflict life-changing injuries,"" he says. And this means some knife victims admitted to hospital have been under the same surgeons before. Their injuries can be caused by any type of knife, from something small picked up in the home home to machetes. Prof Kneebone, who trains surgeons, says small wounds can sometimes be the most dangerous, hiding serious internal damage. ""It could rapidly change. There is an uncertainty about it,"" he says. Prof Kneebone wants to stop this conveyor belt of violence, victims and perpetrators. But he says that warning teenagers about the risks of knife injuries might not really have that much impact. Instead, what really connects is to show them that many stabbing victims end up with a colostomy or ""stoma"" bag. Wearing one of these plastic pouches, used to collect waste from the body when the bowel or rectum is damaged, is not how teenagers want to see themselves. The simulation takes young people through this process - and Prof Kneebone says they ask questions such as how wearing such a pouch would affect sex lives or whether it would smell. Ambreen Imran, a researcher with a background in nursing and working with communities, says there needs to be much more thought about how knife victims are discharged from hospital. She wants to avoid the loop tape of victims returning to the same streets and situations where they are likely to end up coming back to hospital in an ambulance. ""We don't know where people are going back to. We need a wider assessment about whether they are going back to a safe environment,"" she says. There are also plans to extend the simulation to the courts and prison system. ""The conversations about treatment, prevention and consequences need to be connected,"" says Prof Kneebone. Dr Harris says for the surgeons repairing damaged bodies every day, there is an awareness of how easy it is to become a victim. ""It's the wrong place at the wrong time,"" he says. ""There but for the grace of God go I.""",,,,

Hugo Fry, the managing director of its UK arm, told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money that the flu vaccine was one it was not possible to stockpile. ""We prepare in different ways and have prepared many different routes into the UK,"" he said. ""If we have to in the end, we will airlift it in."" He added: ""We are eating the cost of that but patients and citizens are our primary concern, so we're quite happy to take that cost and make that planning."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Those sorts of medicines can be flown in and we have plans for that. I pay tribute to Sanofi and other pharmaceutical companies - they have done an enormous amount of work to make sure people will be safe and medicines can flow. ""In the health department we don't use the word guarantee, as this is a complex system and there are lots of levers beyond our control such as how the French government responds on the Dover/Calais border. ""However, Sanofi have done a tremendous amount of work to ensure people can get their drugs unhindered and if necessary we'll fly them in.""  Sanofi says it is the second biggest of three suppliers of flu vaccines in the UK - behind Seqirus and ahead of Mylan. While Sanofi has plans to keep stockpiles of insulin and vaccines in place for 12 months, Mr Fry said this was not possible with the flu vaccine. ""You can't stockpile it because it's made at a particular time of the year and it's only available to import in the month at the end of August/beginning of September,"" he said. Last August, Sanofi said it was increasing its stocks by four weeks to give it a 14-week supply of medicines. Most of the French company's supplies enter the UK through the Channel Tunnel and disruption to that route in 2005, when there were strikes in France, led to around four weeks of disruption. Mr Fry added: ""We're doing everything possible to make sure that everyone will get their medicines and vaccines so that they can be reassured and they don't have to worry about it. He added that the day after Brexit happens, patients would be able to get their hands on all drugs that it was possible to stockpile.  For the current flu season, Sanofi provided more than seven million vaccines to the UK. There are different vaccines for people aged under 65 in at risk groups and for people who are older than 65. Sanofi and Seqirus supply both age groups, while Mylan have vaccines only for the younger of the two age groups. There is a tender process to decide which company provides vaccines in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while in England and Wales, GPs decide who will supply the vaccines. The tenders for the 2019-20 flu season have already come out, while doctors are currently in the process of deciding who they want to be their supplier.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47691567,"A birth control pill for men has passed initial human safety tests, experts at a leading medical conference have heard. The once-daily pill contains hormones designed to stop sperm production.  It would be a welcome addition to condoms or vasectomy - the only options currently available to men. But doctors at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting were told it could still take a decade to bring it to market.  The female pill was launched in the UK more than 50 years ago. So why is a male pill proving so difficult? Some say there has been less societal and commercial will to get a male pill off the ground - but opinion polls suggest many men would consider taking it if a pill did become available.   Whether women would trust men to reliably take it is another issue.  A UK survey by Anglia Ruskin University, in 2011, found 70 out of 134 women would worry that their male partner would forget to take a pill. Biologically, the challenge of creating a hormone-based pill for men is making sure that it doesn't blunt sex drive or reduce erections. In fertile men, new sperm cells are constantly made in the testicles, triggered by hormones. Temporarily blocking this effect without lowering hormone levels to such an extent that it creates side-effects is the issue. But this latest male pill, being tested by researchers from LA BioMed and the University of Washington, should hopefully achieve this goal, researchers say. Initial ""phase one"" safety tests with 40 men looked promising, they told the Endocrine 2019 meeting in New Orleans.  For the 28 days of the study: And among those taking the androgen-based drug, levels of hormones required for sperm production dropped greatly compared with placebo, returning to normal after the trial. Side-effects, meanwhile, were few and mild.  Five men on the pill reported mildly decreased sex drive - and two described mild erectile dysfunction - but sexual activity was not decreased, no participant stopped taking it because of side-effects and all passed safety tests. The researchers behind the work, Prof Christina Wang and colleagues, are excited but cautious about the findings. ""Our results suggest that this pill, which combines two hormonal activities in one, will decrease sperm production while preserving libido,"" she said. But bigger, longer trials were needed to check it would work well enough as a birth control.  And this is not the only prototype hormone-based male contraceptive Prof Wang has been testing.  She and colleagues have come up with a body gel men in the UK will be trying as part of an international trial.  Users apply it daily to their back and shoulders, where it can be absorbed through the skin. Progestin hormone in the gel blocks natural testosterone production in the testicles, reducing sperm production to low or nonexistent levels, while replacement testosterone in the gel maintains sex drive and other functions that rely on the hormone. Meanwhile, Prof Wang, Dr Stephanie Page, and colleagues at the University of Washington School of Medicine, have been testing another compound - DMAU - that they believe men could take as an oral daily contraceptive pill.  And trials in 100 men have suggested this is safe enough to move into the next phase of testing.  Other scientists have been trying delivering longer-acting birth control hormones in a jab given every other month.  But they stopped enrolling men to their phase-two study, looking at the safety and effectiveness of the injection, after some of the volunteers reported side-effects, including mood disorders or depression.  For men who don't fancy taking hormones, researchers have been looking at ways to block sperm flow, stopping it from ever leaving the penis - effectively, a non-surgical vasectomy. Vasalgel - a polymer material that is injected into the two ducts that transports sperm from the left and right testicles to the penis - is being developed as a non-hormonal, reversible, long-acting male contraceptive.  So far, it has been tested in animals only - but the researchers behind it have recently received funding to look to begin human trials. Prof Richard Anderson, of the University of Edinburgh, is leading one of the UK trials that will test a contraceptive body gel on men.  He said the pharmaceutical industry had been slow to get behind the idea of a new male contraceptive despite good evidence that both men and their female partners would welcome the additional choice. ""I think that industry has not been convinced about the potential market,"" he said. ""It's certainly been a long story - part of it is lack of investment."" With little industry involvement, he said, researchers had had to rely on charitable and academic funding, which took time.  Allan Pacey, professor of andrology, at the University of Sheffield, said: ""The development of a male birth control pill, or injection, has had a chequered history without much success so far and so it is good to see that new preparations are being tested.  ""The key will be if there is enough pharmaceutical company interest to bring this product to market if their trials are successful. ""Unfortunately, so far, there has been very little pharmaceutical company interest in bringing a male contraceptive pill to the market, for reasons that I don't fully understand but I suspect are more down to business than science.""",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47715169,"A county in New York state has declared a state of emergency following a severe outbreak of measles. Rockland County, on the Hudson river north of New York City, has barred unvaccinated children from public spaces after 153 cases were confirmed. Violating the order will be punishable by a fine of $500 (£378) and up to six months in prison. The announcement follows other outbreaks of the disease in Washington, California, Texas and Illinois. Vaccination rates have dropped steadily in the US with many parents objecting for philosophical or religious reasons, or because they believe discredited information that vaccines cause autism in children. ""We will not sit idly by while children in our community are at risk,"" Rockland County Executive Ed Day said. ""This is a public health crisis and it is time to sound the alarm."" The outbreak in Rockland County is largely concentrated in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, the New York Times reported. It is believed it could have spread from other predominantly ultra-Orthodox areas around New York which have already seen outbreaks of measles. Mr Day said health inspectors had encountered ""resistance"" from some local residents, which he branded ""unacceptable and irresponsible"". ""They've been told 'We're not discussing this, do not come back' when visiting the homes of infected individuals as part of their investigations,"" he said. According to the CDC, there are 314 cases of measles currently reported in the US, with nearly half of those coming from Rockland County. Dylan Skriloff, the editor of local newspaper the Rockland County Times, told the BBC the number of measles cases in the county had been increasing steadily in recent weeks.  ""The first reports came six months ago, and each week we've had a new report with increased numbers,"" he said.  ""It's become clear that it's not abating, and the authorities... don't want to accept [this reality] as the new normal.""  Skriloff said that the authorities had been making ""steady progress"" in encouraging religious communities to immunise children but communication had broken down in the last month.  ""The rate of immunisation in the religious communities, for young people, it's about 50%-60%, which is not nearly enough."" Officials said the order, which bans anyone under the age of 18 who has not been vaccinated from places such as schools, shopping centres, restaurants and places of worship, would come into effect at midnight on Wednesday and last 30 days. However, the order notes that authorities ""will not be patrolling or asking for vaccination records"", just referring those found to violate the order to the District Attorney's Office.  Some critics say that without a plan to enforce the order, it is a useless measure that fails to protect anyone, while others have accused the local government of overreach. Rockland County has a population of more than 300,000.  By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News Both Europe and the US are dealing with outbreaks of measles, but why now?  Nothing has changed about the virus; the answer instead lies in human behaviour.  Myths about the vaccine causing autism have been debunked but are still affecting the number of children being immunised. And complacency from a generation of parents unfamiliar with the dangers of measles has also had an effect.  So with every year that goes by, the total number of unvaccinated people grows, often in pockets in some communities. It is like an ever-growing tinderbox just waiting for a spark.  Measles still runs rampant in many parts of the world - it kills around 90,000 people a year. All it takes is a bit of travel for measles to reach those vulnerable pockets and spread like wildfire. Measles is a highly infectious disease and can cause serious health complications, including damage to the lungs and brain. But despite the dangers, vaccination rates are declining in many countries. In the UK, the government is seeking new legislation to force social media companies to remove content promoting false information about vaccines. There were more than 82,500 cases in Europe in 2018 - the highest number in a decade and three times the total reported in 2017. The World Health Organization has declared the anti-vaccine movement to be one of the top global health threats for 2019. Have you been affected by the order put in place? What is your reaction?

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47699061,"A football app start-up in Gothenburg is set to become the first business in Sweden to be certified as menstruation-friendly. But how much do employees really want to talk about their periods? Rows of top-division European football kits hang from a giant goal net hooked to the ceiling, while two male developers kick a ball around on a green fake grass carpet. This isn't the most obvious place to be championing a more supportive environment for women during their periods.  Indeed, Forza Football's chief executive Patrik Arnesson admits he ""didn't think about the menstrual cycle at all"" before a female employee asked if the firm could take part in a pilot scheme designed to break down taboos around menstruation. ""No one had actually told me they had to leave work to go home because of PMS,"" he says. ""And then I actually realized that this is a problem and I haven't even reflected on it."" PMS, or premenstrual syndrome, is the name for the symptoms some women experience before their period which can include mood swings, feeling anxious or irritable and tiredness. Headaches or cramps ahead of or during menstruation are also common. But each person's symptoms are different and can vary from month to month. The project in Gothenburg is being led by a non-profit called Mensen (Menses) which was given a grant of 530,000 kronor ($58,400; £44,900) from the Swedish government's Gender Equality Agency at the end of last year. Since March it has started inviting all employees to attend discussions and workshops about the effects of menstruation. These will then be used to form the basis for a certification programme that the organisation wants to see rolled out nationwide or even globally. Klara Rydström, who is leading the project for Mensen, says that while Sweden has a global reputation for supporting women's rights, there is still a stigma around discussing menstruation in many workplaces. ""But it's something we have to talk about, because it's a bodily function - a normal bodily function - just as being thirsty and you have to have water, or you're hungry and you have to have a lunch break,"" she argues.  Forza Football, which currently has around 60 workers and a 70:30 ratio of male and female employees, has already made several key changes - including providing free sanitary products and bins in company toilets And flexible working has been introduced for all staff, so they can pick their own office hours or work from home when they want to.  Women are actively encouraged to tell other team members if they choose to be away from the office because of PMS and even to share their cycle dates and symptoms with other team members in advance if they feel comfortable with the idea. ""I get really sad and lose all my self-confidence and self-esteem. It's kind of hard to do meetings where I need to be focused and positive,"" says software developer and project manager Lisa Hammarström. She says she's felt more relaxed talking about her symptoms since Forza Football started taking part in the Mensen project.  Colleagues are happy for her to have a lighter workload when she's premenstrual, she says, because she's very productive during the rest of the month. ""I realized that it makes things easier for me if people know what is going on and how it affects your work."" Account manager Manolo Obaya admits that for some male staff, discussing periods in the workplace has been bit ""awkward"". ""When (women are) hormonal, is that a justification for not delivering on work or whatever? It's hard to me to to say because I've never been in that position,"" he says, adding that he hopes the project will leave him better informed. ""I think the value is just making everybody aware that some girls suffer more than others and that we should be trying to be understanding of that particular situation.""  While Forza Football is currently the only company working towards gaining a formal certification, the media buzz around the project has already spurred other businesses to take similar steps. Several Gothenburg start-ups have recently introduced free sanitary protection and painkillers for employees. In Stockholm, a PR agency A Perfect Day Media grabbed headlines after mulling the idea of giving female staff the chance to enter their cycle dates in a shared spreadsheet. The project didn't get off the ground, but the company says it is looking at other ways to spark more open discussions about menstruation. ""The most important thing is that women do not feel we must be silent or ashamed about having our period,"" says the agency's cofounder Amanda Schulman. ""We are actively working to ensure that women have the same rights as men, [but] this is not what reality looks like for many women who suffer from PMS, PMDD (a more severe form of PMS) or endometriosis. It is an important battle for us."" But while there is clearly a strong movement championing menstrual rights in Sweden, there has also been criticism of these kind of initiatives. Ivar Arpi, a columnist for Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet - currently writing a book about gender ideology - argues that suggesting women might need special treatment dredges up old anti-feminist arguments that men and women aren't equal because ""female bodies can't be trusted to work properly for the whole month"".  ""Now you get a 'carte blanche' to act bad and you can blame your menstruation. That's really silly,"" he argues. For other political commentators, including Linda Norlund who writes for tabloid newspaper Expressen, privacy is a key concern. ""I don't think that my period is my boss's business frankly, and I think that in the workplace it's important to keep a professional atmosphere and not be too personal."" Josefin Eklund, who works in Forza Football's branding team, argues that even among educated women there can be a ""real lack of knowledge"" about PMS and PMDD. She herself struggled with severe headaches and fatigue that she didn't initially attribute to her menstrual cycle. ""I was always taking two days off a month,"" she explains.  ""I started to schedule or write down how I was feeling to see if I could find a pattern and eventually I did. I could see it was related to my menstruation."" ""Menstruation will always exist, so it's better just to know how to deal with it instead of pretending that it's not going on."" Mensen's Klara Rydström says she hopes the project will also encourage men to be more open about their health and wellbeing in the workplace too. ""It opens up (discussions) for other issues as well related to men's bodies or the work environment in general. So I think it's very applicable to everyone.""",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47709074,"Psychotic experiences - such as hearing voices or extreme paranoia - are more common in teenagers living in cities with high pollution than those in rural areas, a study of young people in England and Wales suggests. Scientists say that their research could provide possible clues about why children in urban areas are more likely to get psychotic disorders later on. But they caution that much more work is needed to be certain of the link. The study appears in JAMA Psychiatry.  Scientists from King's College London tracked some 2,000 teenagers living in urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Almost a third (623) reported they had been through at least one psychotic experience between the ages of 12 and 18 - for example feeling like people were spying on them or hearing voices no-one else could.  Researchers matched their responses to detailed estimates of the air pollution each adolescent faced over a year.  Scientists say the findings remained firm even when they factored in other issues that can contribute to psychotic episodes - including a family history of mental health issues, social deprivation and alcohol and drugs.  Lead researcher, Dr Joanne Newbury, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, said: ""We found that adolescent psychotic experiences were more common in urban areas."" She added that while the study could not show pollutants caused the episodes to take place, ""our findings suggest air pollution could be a contributing factor in the link between city living and psychotic experiences"". Researchers say that while the study does not prove that air pollution causes psychotic experiences, it adds to growing evidence that air pollution may have wider effects on the body beyond the heart and lungs.  They speculate that tiny particles of air pollution could get past the lungs and into the blood and then travel on to the brain. There they could trigger inflammation and contribute to poor mental health.  Another theory is that the chemicals coating these particles could dissolve in the blood and be carried to the brain and again lead to inflammation.  The research team say that noise pollution could partially explain the link too - for example noisy traffic could disturb sleep and add to the stress of city life.  But they were unable to measure this directly.  Although it is not always possible, experts suggest trying to use side roads and keeping away from the busiest roads when traffic is at its heaviest.  Scientists estimated four outdoor pollutants; the gases nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter - PM2.5 and PM10 - at home addresses and two places the teenagers frequently spent time at - for example schools, work and shops.  And while the researchers say they took other factors like alcohol and drugs into account, they acknowledge it is impossible to be sure they factored in everything.  Dr Daniel Maughan, at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""While the paper has not proved air pollution causes psychosis, the findings are concerning as they suggest that increased psychosis rates in urban areas are potentially linked to air pollution.  ""We need a radical approach to air pollution as it is very likely damaging the mental health of young and older people alike."" Meanwhile Prof Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, at the University of Heidelberg, said: ""While this is a careful study of a large cohort, it should be borne in mind that researchers did not actually measure, but modelled, air quality and also could not know when participants were where.  ""Also, most evidence points to the relevance of early childhood in psychosis risk, a period the study did not cover.  ""While the authors looked at many potential factors that could influence air quality and psychosis risk, such as neighbourhood socio-economic status, the findings should be replicated in a setting where pollution and location are directly measured before firm conclusions can be drawn.""   Researchers say they looked specifically at adolescents, because their developing brains are more vulnerable to psychotic experiences. They consider these to be a milder form of the experiences that people have, who go on to develop disorders like schizophrenia in adulthood. Teenagers who have them are more likely - though certainly not guaranteed - to develop psychotic disorders in later life. So scientists say identifying them at this stage could provide an opportunity to intervene ahead of time.  But they reassure parents that long-term psychotic disorders are rare and most teenagers who go through these experiences do not go on to develop them. The NHS says that traumatic experiences, stress, alcohol and drug abuse can all trigger episodes of psychosis.  Researchers say anyone who is concerned about an adolescent's mental health should speak to their GP or seek urgent medical advice if the problem is immediate.",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-47719718,"Jo Cameron only realises her skin is burning when she smells singed flesh. She often burns her arms on the oven, but feels no pain to warn her.  That's because she is one of only two people in the world known to have a rare genetic mutation. It means she feels virtually no pain, and never feels anxious or afraid.  It wasn't until she was 65 she realised she was different - when doctors couldn't believe she didn't need painkillers after a serious operation. When she had surgery on her hand, doctors warned her she should expect pain afterwards.  When she felt nothing, her anaesthetist - Dr Devjit Srivastava - sent her to pain geneticists at University College London (UCL) and Oxford University.   After tests, they found gene mutations which meant that she did not feel pain like most people.  Jo, from Whitebridge, near Inverness, told the BBC Scotland news website that doctors didn't believe her when she said she wouldn't need pain relief after surgery.  She said: ""We had banter before theatre when I guaranteed I wouldn't need painkillers.  ""When he found I hadn't had any, he checked my medical history and found I had never asked for painkillers."" That's when she was referred to specialists in England.  Once diagnosed, Jo realised that she wasn't just ""incredibly healthy"", as she'd believed.  She said: ""Looking back, I realise I hadn't needed painkillers, but if you don't need them you don't question why you don't.   ""You are what you are, until someone points it out you don't question it. I was just a happy soul who didn't realise there was anything different about me."" She didn't even feel pain during childbirth, recalling: ""It was just strange, but I didn't have pain. It was quite enjoyable really."" Jo wouldn't change anything, but thinks pain is important and says: ""Pain is there for a reason, it warns you - you hear alarm bells.  ""It would be nice to have warning when something's wrong - I didn't know my hip was gone until it was really gone, I physically couldn't walk with my arthritis."" Doctors believe she might also be able to heal more quickly than normal. This particular combination of genes also makes her forgetful and less anxious.  ""It's called the happy gene or forgetful gene. I have been annoying people by being happy and forgetful all my life - I've got an excuse now,"" she said.  Jo said recently she had a ""minor bump"" in the car, but was unmoved by what many would have found an upsetting experience.  ""I don't have adrenalin. You should have that warning, it's part of being human, but I wouldn't change it."" The other driver, she said, was ""shaking like anything"", but she was able to stay calm. ""I don't get that reaction... it's not brave, the fear just doesn't happen."" The researchers say it's possible there are more people like Jo.  ""One out of two patients after surgery today still experiences moderate to severe pain, despite all advances in pain killer medications. It remains to be seen if any new treatments could be developed based on our findings,"" said Dr Srivastava. ""The findings point towards a novel painkiller discovery that could potentially offer post-surgical pain relief and also accelerate wound healing. We hope this could help the 330 million patients who undergo surgery globally every year.""  Jo's case is the subject of a paper published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia, written by Dr Srivastava and Dr James Cox, of UCL.  Dr Cox said: ""People with rare insensitivity to pain can be valuable to medical research as we learn how their genetic mutations impact how they experience pain, so we would encourage anyone who does not experience pain to come forward.  ""We hope that with time, our findings might contribute to clinical research for post-operative pain and anxiety, and potentially chronic pain, PTSD and wound healing.""",,,,

""I didn't tell my friends and family because I didn't want them to say 'are you crazy?',"" says the 53-year-old. ""Of course I also had my own misgivings about travelling to Central America and having major surgery."" Melissa, from the town of Brandon in Mississippi, is one of a growing number of people around the world who are going abroad for cheaper or quicker medical treatment. While many Americans do so because they don't have health insurance - official figures show that more than 28 million do not  - others like Melissa go overseas because their basic cover means that they have to pay a sizeable chunk of any treatment bill. She says that her knee operation in Clinica Biblica, Costa Rica's largest private hospital, cost $12,200 (£9,200), compared with around $44,000 in the US. Patients Beyond Borders, a publisher of guidebooks for ""medical tourists"" estimates that more than 20 million people will travel to another country for medical treatment this year, up 25% from 16 million last year. Meanwhile, a 2016 report by payments giant Visa estimated that the medical tourism industry was worth $50bn a year, and continuing to grow. Yet before people in the UK feel relieved about having the National Health Service, with its free at the point of delivery service, more and more Britons are also going abroad for treatment. This is more often so they can avoid waiting lists, get cosmetic surgery that is not covered by the NHS, or for dental work due to a lack of NHS dentists. Medigo, a German-based medical travel company says that queries from UK residents jumped 53% last year. Official figures from the UK's Office of National Statistics also show that a rising number of people are going abroad for treatment. One British person who recently travelled abroad for surgery was Amanda Wells, from the Scottish town of Dalkeith, near Edinburgh. The 46-year-old travelled to Poland last year - via Medigo - to have a painful bunion removed from her left foot, because she didn't want to wait the nine months that her GP estimated it would take her to get the operation on the NHS. She says she was able to get the work done in Poland for £3,000, half the amount she was quoted by a private surgeon in the UK. ""I did my research regarding waiting times to meet with a [NHS] surgeon, and I discovered that my GP was being optimistic,"" she says. ""The facilities were excellent in Poland. The surgeon was fantastic and I saw him for three follow-ups before I went home."" Another Briton who went abroad for treatment last year was Lincoln Summers, of Woking, south west of London. He went to a dentist in Hungary. ""I looked like a mobster after one of my front teeth broke off,"" says the 54-year-old. Lincoln says he got an implant fitted in Budapest for £800 compared with the £2,500 he was quoted by a private UK dentist. ""It was not what I expected at all [in Hungary], it was a state-of-the-art dentist,"" he adds. While both Lincoln, Amanda - and Melissa in the US - say they were very happy with the medical care they received, some experts urge medical tourists to be cautious. Especially if people are travelling to the developing world. ""People go abroad thinking they are going to get affordable care... and they get back to the States and end up having massive medical bills because they require treatment of infections, and they require additional surgery,"" says Prof Leigh Turner, from the School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota. ""If they have insurance, their insurance doesn't cover it.  It ends being a costly experience."" Despite this risk, the number of Americans going abroad for medical treatment goes up every year. About 422,000 did so in 2017, according to the US National Travel and Tourism Office. That is up from 295,383 in 2000. ""The number of uninsured Americans began to climb again in 2017,"" says Prof Turner. ""And... it seems plausible that reductions in insurance coverage are pushing more Americans to search elsewhere for affordable medical care."" More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Josef Woodman, chief executive of Patients Without Borders, says that much of the growth in global health tourism is coming from people in the developing world. ""You have got literally hundreds of millions of people entering the middle class in China, in India, and in Indonesia,"" he says. ""The healthcare systems in these countries don't offer them what they need in terms of speciality, complex care."" Back in Mississippi, Melissa Moore is continuing to recover from her knee operation in Costa Rica earlier this year. She praises all the staff that treated her. ""I had a meltdown one day [at the hospital] because of the pain, and the feeling of helplessness,"" she says. ""But the nurses and techs were so sweet and helped to calm me.""",,,,
1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47723704,"Drinking one 750ml bottle of wine a week increases the risk of developing cancer over a lifetime by the equivalent of 10 cigarettes a week for women and five for men, a study says. The UK researchers said this was a good way of communicating the health risks of moderate drinking. But experts said that smoking carried much greater cancer risks than alcohol, for most drinkers.   And the only way to cut the risks from smoking was to quit completely. Government guidelines on alcohol consumption advise men and women to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week - the equivalent of six pints of average strength beer or seven glasses of wine (or a bottle and a half of wine). The guidance also says there is no ""safe"" level of drinking when it comes to health risk. This study says even moderate drinking can put people at risk of cancer, particularly breast cancer, which is the most common cancer in women in the UK. Writing in BMC Public Health, the researchers calculated that if 1,000 non-smoking men and 1,000 non-smoking women each drank one bottle of wine a week, around 10 extra men and 14 extra women could develop cancer during their lives. In women, alcohol intake was linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and in men, it was linked to cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and liver. For their calculations, the research team from the University of Southampton and Bangor University, used data on cancer risk from Cancer Research UK and data on the number of cancers in the population that could be linked to tobacco and alcohol. Dr Minouk Schoemaker, scientist at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, who conducts research into the causes of breast cancer, said the study offered an ""interesting insight"" but the picture was not simple. ""The overall picture of cancer risk is enormously complex and nuanced, so it's important to keep in mind that this new study is subject to a number of assumptions,"" she said.  ""For example, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of alcohol and cigarette smoking entirely, and the study did not take into account the duration of smoking or time since stopping."" The study only looked at cancer - not at any other disease, such as cardiovascular or lung diseases common in smokers. It also used data from 2004 and did not take into account other factors which could cause cancers, such as age, family genes, diet and other aspects of lifestyle. And the numbers of cigarettes ""equivalent"" to alcohol are small, when most smokers smoke many more a day. As a result, for some, the jury is out on how useful the study is. Prof John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at the University of Nottingham, said: ""I'm not sure many people decide whether to smoke or drink... based on how comparable the risks of the two are.   ""This study demonstrates that in relation to cancer risk, smoking is substantially more hazardous than alcohol consumption. Smoking is also far more hazardous than alcohol in relation to a range of other diseases.   ""If smokers are worried about their health, the best thing they can do is quit smoking.  ""People who consume alcohol should try to stick within the recommended guidelines of 14 units per week,"" Prof Britton added. But Dr Bob Patton, lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Surrey, said the study could transform public opinion. ""It is likely that the findings from this simple study will have a profound effect on the way that drinkers, and in particular female drinkers, regard the risks associated with alcohol consumption,"" he said. ""Viewing alcohol drinking in the same light as cigarette smoking may well result in a decrease in consumption and its related harms.""",,,,

North Bristol NHS Trust has told 57 patients at Southmead Hospital in Bristol they should have been offered alternative treatment first.  Surgeon Tony Dixon was suspended in 2017 after concerns were first raised. Dozens of women had told the BBC they were left in severe pain after pelvic floor surgery using artificial mesh. Mr Dixon pioneered the use of artificial mesh to lift prolapsed bowels - a technique known as laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR) - often caused by childbirth. The trust carried out a review after concerns were raised with the BBC by patients who suffered complications and ended up in chronic pain following the procedure. Paula Goss, 49, from south Gloucestershire, was told the surgery ""would change her life [and] would make everything better"" but was now ""disabled in many ways because of it"". The operations began in the early 2000s, although the review only investigated cases from 2007 to 2017.  The vast majority of the operations were carried out by Mr Dixon, but some were performed by a further three surgeons. The trust said although their operations were carried out successfully, the 57 patients were told they ""should have been offered alternative treatments before proceeding to surgery"". A further 73 patients have been told their surgery was appropriate, and investigations into 13 other cases are still to be completed.  The trust's medical director, Dr Chris Burton, said he wanted to apologise to patients who received unnecessary surgery. ""It is unacceptable and we are taking it extremely seriously,"" he said. He added immediate action was taken to ""ensure it couldn't happen again"", and patients have been supported. ""We will keep investigating to ensure we have identified those patients affected by these issues, and to find out what happened to learn lessons for future care."" Mr Dixon, who also performed operations at Spire Hospital in Bristol, said he was ""unable to comment on specific allegations... due to patient confidentiality and while relevant investigations are on-going"". ""There is a need for caution in comparing the use of mesh in different procedures with very different risks and outcomes,"" he added. Spire Healthcare said it was carrying out a similar review which it hoped would be complete in May.",,,,

Arifa Sultana, 20, gave birth to a baby in late February, but 26 days later was rushed again to another hospital after feeling pain in her stomach. Doctors found she was still pregnant with twins in a second uterus, and performed an emergency Caesarean. Her twins were found to be healthy and were discharged with no complications. Ms Sultana, who is from a rural village, delivered her first baby at the Khulna Medical College Hospital in Khulna district. Just 26 days later, she complained of stomach pain and was rushed to the Ad-din Hospital in Jessore district on 21 March, Dr Sheila Poddar, the gynaecologist who performed the Caesarean told the BBC. Some media reports put the date as 22 March. ""When the patient came in we performed an ultrasound on her and found there were twin babies,"" Dr Poddar said. ""We were very shocked and surprised. I have never observed something like this before."" It is unclear why she might have chosen to go to a different hospital. According to Dr Poddar, Ms Sultana and her husband are ""very poor"" and she had ""never had an ultrasound before"", in the run up to her first delivery.  ""She had no idea that she had two other babies,"" said Dr Poddar. ""We carried out a caesarean and she delivered twins, one male and female."" The 20-year-old and her newborns were discharged on 25 March after four days in hospital. ""The babies and her are all healthy. I am very, very happy that everything went well,"" Dr Poddar said. One gynaecologist in Singapore said uterus didelphys - the condition of having two uteruses - is ""not as rare as people think"".  ""If you go for a scan beforehand it would be very obvious to see two sets of uteruses. But obviously they are from a more rural area [and might not have access to ultrasound scanning],"" Dr Christopher Ng of the GynaeMD Clinic told the BBC. ""[It's likely that] three eggs ovulated and were fertilised at the same time during her fertile period which resulted in three embryos."" It is a disorder in which a female develops a double uterus instead of one.  The uterus starts out as two small tubes in a foetus and these normally join together to form one large organ - but if they don't a double uterus may be formed. Such abnormalities vary in severity and in some cases can cause fertility problems. There are varying estimates as to how common the condition is. It is thought to affect about one in 1,000 women in the UK. Often women who have the condition do not have symptoms and it is usually discovered during pregnancy when an ultrasound scan is given. Ms Sultana said she was happy with her children but was concerned that raising them would put a strain on her financial situation, according to AFP news agency.  Her husband earns less than 6,000 taka (£53; $69) a month as a labourer, but he said he would ""try his best"", AFP reported. ""It was a miracle from Allah that all my children are healthy.

1903,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47734293,"French scientists say they have proof that dogs can pick up the smell of an epileptic seizure. The University of Rennes team hope the findings could lead to ways to predict when people will have a seizure.  These could include dogs or ""electronic noses"" that pick up the precise odour being given off during a seizure.  Dogs have previously been shown to be able to sniff out diseases including cancers, Parkinson's, malaria and diabetes.  Some people with epilepsy already rely on the animals.  One sleeping in a child's bedroom can alert family members of a seizure in the middle of the night.  The latest study, in the journal Scientific Reports, trained five dogs from Medical Mutts, in the US, to recognise the smell of sweat taken from a patient having a seizure. They were then given a choice of seven sweat samples taken from other patients while they were either relaxing, exercising or having a seizure.  Two of the dogs found the seizure sample about two-thirds of the time and the other three were 100% accurate The report says: ""The results are extremely clear and constitute a first step towards identifying a seizure-specific odour."" That would require detailed chemical analysis to identify the specific compounds involved.  It is also unknown how an epileptic seizure leads to a change in smell. Dr Amelie Catala, from the University of Rennes, told BBC News: ""Further research is needed but it is possible that the change in electrical activity triggers the releasing of some neurohormones that will in the end trigger the scent or that it is linked to stress-related molecules and pathways, or anything else - all hypothesis are still to be considered.""  But the researchers hope the field could eventually help patients. ""It could lead to significant improvements in terms of seizure detection or prediction systems,"" the report adds. And that could give time for someone to call for help or get themselves somewhere safe before their seizure begins.  Follow James on Twitter.",,,,

International sportswoman Catarina Sequeira was declared brain dead after an acute asthma attack at her home. The baby, named Salvador, was born when she was almost 32 weeks pregnant and is being cared for in a neonatal hospital. This is the second such case in Portugal of a baby born to a mother who was brain dead. A talented canoeist who had represented her country, Sequeira had suffered from asthma since she was a child.  She suffered an asthma attack when she was 19 weeks pregnant and was put in an induced coma. However, her condition deteriorated and within days she was declared brain dead on 26 December, reports say. For 56 days a ventilator was attached to her to enable her baby to survive in her womb. Doctors said the intention had been to wait until Friday for the mother to reach 32 weeks' gestation, but her respiratory condition had deteriorated and the Caesarean section was brought forward to Thursday.  Thirty-two weeks was considered the period at which babies had a very high probability of survival, hospital officials said. The head of the hospital's ethics committee, Filipe Almeida, explained that the decision to keep the baby alive in the mother's womb was made in discussion with the family and because she had never opted out of Portugal's presumed-consent organ donation law.  ""Being a donor is not just about being in a position to donate a liver or heart or lung, but also being in a position to give yourself so a child can live,"" he said. ""And no-one has the right to interrupt the mother's decision process,"" he told the Observador website. The baby's father wanted the child to be born, as did the rest of the family.  Sequeira's mother, Maria de Fátima Branco, told Portuguese TV that she had said goodbye to her daughter on 26 December and the decision to keep the baby had been made because the father, Bruno, had always wanted to be a father. The baby was born weighing 1.7kg (3.75 lbs) and is expected to remain in hospital for at least three weeks, reports say. In 2016 another baby, Lourenço, was born in Lisbon after surviving 15 weeks in his dead mother's womb.",,,,
1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47749964,"Psychiatrists are being urged to ask children with mental health issues how long they spend online and what they use social media for.
Questions about technology should be a routine part of assessments, the Royal College of Psychiatrists says. 
It is concerned about how time spent online impacts on mood, sleep, diet and behaviour.
The government is expected to announce plans to regulate social media companies soon.
The College's advice comes as evidence grows of a possible link between harmful content or time spent online, and poor mental health.
It is planning to publish a report later this year about its stance on technology use and children's mental health, which will include recommendations for parents, children and doctors.
When assessing children, psychiatrists are being advised to think about:
The Royal College of Psychiatrists recommends that children stop using technology at least an hour before going to bed, and avoid using technology at mealtimes.
This is a view echoed by the Chief Medical Officer in her recent guidance on social media.
A group of MPs recently called for a tax on social media companies' profits, saying the firms are operating in ""an online wild west"" and should help fund research into the links between technology use and mental illness.
The government is expected to announce plans for an independent regulator which would enforce a new statutory 'duty of care' on social media companies.
This comes after growing concerns about graphic online content, including material featuring suicide and self-harm.
Earlier this year, the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017, said Instagram had ""helped kill"" his daughter.
Dr Bernadka Dubicka, chair of the child and adolescent faculty at RCPsych, said: ""Although we recognise that social media and technology are not primary drivers of mental illness in young people, we know that they are an important part of their lives and can be harmful in some situations.
""As a frontline clinician, I regularly see young people who have deliberately hurt themselves after discussing self-harm techniques online. 
""Clinicians recognise the well-known phenomena of young people copying each other's harmful behaviour while on in-patient units, but it's even more worrying to see this replicated in the online world where audiences are so much bigger.""  
She added: ""We're also finding that some young people report being recommended harmful content; for example, links to websites encouraging weight loss or displaying self-harm after searching for, or clicking on, similar content just once before.""
Dr Dubicka said it was important to consider whether social media was affecting children and young people's mental health so that the causes of their distress could be addressed.
Emma Thomas, chief executive of Young Minds, said: ""Young people we work with rarely say that social media is the 'cause' of mental health conditions, but they say it can heighten problems that they are already struggling with, adding to anxiety or making them feel worse when they compare their lives to those of other people.""
Claire Murdoch, national director for mental health at NHS England, said: ""Social media plays a big part in everyday life for most children and young people, but it should act as a wake-up call when leading psychiatrists say online activities now need to be considered when assessing youngsters' mental health and wellbeing.""
She said the NHS planned to improve access to mental health services for young people but expected social media giants to ""step up to the plate"".",,,,

The National Association for the Children of Alcoholics took more than 23,000 calls or messages last year from over 18s, compared to 6,400 in 2013.
Experts say more funding to support families and friends would help more people with alcoholic parents. 
The Department of Health said it was investing £6m to tackle the issue.
'My homeless dad'
Amelia and Joe Carr, from Newcastle, grew up with an alcoholic father. 
His drinking became very serious when Joe was 13 and Amelia was five. It continued up until his death two years ago. Towards the end of his life he was sleeping rough. 
""It was the thing I'd been dreading seeing, my own dad homeless on the street,"" Joe says.
""I found him inebriated, as he always was, and dirty; sat in a doorway with a bottle. When I saw the state he was in all my anger evaporated and was replaced instead with pity.""
Children whose parents drink too much are said to be four times more likely to become dependent drinkers themselves. 
Joe developed an issue with alcohol as an adult but he gave up completely when he became a father and is now teetotal. However, his ability to quit led to a new, very painful thought. 
""I can't help but think if I could do that for my children why couldn't he?"" he says.
Joe remembers the happy times before his father's issues with alcohol started. But Amelia, eight years his junior, only remembers her father drinking. When he died she says in some ways she felt relieved. 
""Everyone around me was grieving for the man he was,"" she says, ""but I just couldn't do that - I felt so guilty and confused.""
The drug and alcohol charity Addaction says approximately one in three older adults with an alcohol problem first develop it later in life. 
A spokesman told 5 Live Investigates they would like to see more support and ease of access to services for people over the age of 50 with alcohol misuse issues. 
The National Association for the Children of Alcoholics (NACOA) supports those who have lived through childhood with their parent's alcohol problems. They also offer help to people whose parent's issues emerged in later life.
Stephanie Page, a helpline supervisor at the the charity, said: ""The feelings of guilt have been born out of the anger and resentment towards their parent but they still love them so they feel guilty about feeling that sort of way towards them."" 
She also said that people whose parents began drinking later tend to face a different set of challenges. 
""The parent may have retired and is lonely; they may have had issues adjusting to retirement. The adult child of the alcoholic often finds that really difficult because they haven't seen this side of them before and they may not know what to do.
""It can be really surreal seeing this side to your parent."" 
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it can be ""incredibly damaging for a young person to grow up with an alcoholic parent and can lead to lifelong harm"". 
""We are investing £6m to support children of dependent parents, and services including alcohol treatment and mental health services are available for people who are suffering the impact of parental drinking as adults.""
The spokesman said every person admitted to hospital showing signs of alcohol dependence in the 25% worst affected parts of the country will be offered ""targeted help to stop"".

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47735103,"The current system of checking newborns for hip problems is failing, resulting in too many late diagnoses and corrective surgery, a study suggests.
All newborns in England have their hips examined but only those at risk or with problems receive a scan.
Surgeons from Southampton Children's Hospital said the rate of late diagnoses had not improved since screening started, over 30 years ago.
But Public Health England said scanning all newborns could cause more problems. 
Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), if picked up early in babies, can be treated using a removable splint worn for two to three months.
But if there is a delay in diagnosis of up to a year or more, untreated hip dysplasia can lead to a shortened leg, surgery and the risk of continuing hip pain and long-term complications.
Alexander Aarvold, study author and consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Southampton, said untreated hip dysplasia was ""a significant public health issue"" and the current approach had ""failed to impact"" on late diagnoses in children.
""The signs are easily missed. They can be subtle,"" he said.
""Doctors, midwives and nurses may be doing the checks and if they are not used to seeing hip dysplasia, it is hard to pick up.""
The research, by orthopaedic surgeons in The Bone and Joint Journal, looked at 754 cases of children diagnosed late with the hip problem - defined as after the age of one - between 1990 and 2016, a rate of 1.28 cases per 1,000 births.
But UK studies before the hip screening programme began, in 1986, show the rate of late diagnoses then was only 0.88 per 1,000 births.
And smaller regional studies from the 1960s and 70s reveal even lower figures.
Tim Theologis, president of the British Society for Children's Orthopaedic Surgery, said: ""This study has provided evidence that the current selective screening for neonatal hip dysplasia is ineffective and the percentage of infants diagnosed late is unacceptably high.""
Other countries, such as Germany and Austria, perform ultrasound scans of the hips of all newborns - and late diagnosis is extremely low there.
But Prof Anne Mackie, director of screening at Public Health England, said: ""Offering a universal scan can cause more harm and evidence shows that it can lead to 20 times more babies being unnecessarily treated compared to the UK programme. 
""We know that wearing a splint in the crucial early months can affect the bond between mother and baby and can also cause avascular necrosis where the hip 'dies'.""
PHE said it was planning to introduce some changes to the screening process and looking at more training for clinicians carrying out the examinations.
It's a condition where the ""ball and socket"" joint of the hip does not form properly.
This socket of the hip is too shallow and so the head of the thigh bone is not held tightly in place, making the hip joint loose. Sometimes, it can come out of the socket or dislocate
Babies' hips are checked as part of a physical examination within 72 hours of being born and again at six to eight weeks old.
The examination involves gentle manipulation of a baby's hip joints to check if there are any problems. 
DDH is more common in girls than boys and more common in the left hip.
Without treatment, DDH may lead to problems later in life, including:
With early diagnosis and treatment, most children are able to develop normally and have a full range of movement in their hip.

It is not unusual to find Easter eggs on sale in the first week of January - but most people are irritated by the practice, the Royal Society of Public Health said. 
It wants retailers to crack down on early sales of seasonal products high in fat, salt and sugar.
Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), said: ""We recognise that special occasions such as Easter are a time for indulgence and treats.  
""However, it is clear that many shops and supermarkets are pushing products way too early.
""If supermarkets are serious about tackling the obesity epidemic, we would urge retailers to change their marketing strategies in the interest of the public's health.""
In a survey of 2,000 adults in the UK, two-thirds said holidays and special occasions were used too much to sell unhealthy food while a third said it made them eat less healthily.
More than half of parents said their child had been tempted by an Easter treat displayed near checkouts and half of those surveyed said they had already bought and eaten at least one chocolate Easter egg or cake this year.
A 256g Cadbury's chocolate egg contains about 1,375 calories - that's more than half the recommended daily calorie intake limit of 2000kcal for a woman, and 2,500kcal for a man.
With one in four adults and one in five 10 to 11-year-old children in the UK classified as obese, the RSPH says more should be done to reverse these trends.
It urges retailers to stop pushing unhealthy products at checkouts - a proposal contained in the government's plan to halve childhood obesity in England by 2030.
Andrew Opie, from the British Retail Consortium, said: ""The bulk of Easter egg purchases are made in the week before Easter as customers scramble to buy eggs for family and friends. 
""However, many of us choose to buy and enjoy eggs even before Easter, and retailers cater to that demand as well.""",,,,

Jane Haines is talking about her daughter, Ayla, who has been in secure units for people with learning difficulties for seven years. 
A government programme to move people out of these units after an abuse scandal is a failure, campaigners say.
The government said in 2015 it was committed to reducing inpatient numbers in England by at least 35%, although it has only relocated 20% so far.
That means 2,000 patients remain in them and the government has extended the original March 2019 deadline to 2020.
Jane's daughter was admitted to an Assessment and Treatment Unit (ATU) at 19, after struggling with anorexia and other mental health issues. 
These secure units treat vulnerable young people who are deemed to be a danger to themselves. 
Patients are supposed to be admitted for nine to 18 months, but the average stay is more than five years. 
Ayla has spent the past seven years as an inpatient and is currently living in Northamptonshire, more than 200 miles away from her home in Carmarthen. 
Jane tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme it has led to desperate behaviour, including swallowing a toothbrush, which is still in her body 10 months later.
""She's got a huge bald patch on her head where her hair will never grow back, from all the head banging she's done,"" she says. ""One of the doctors said possibly she's caused more brain damage.
""We are powerless and have to sit back and watch her suffer,"" says Ayla's grandmother Judy Haines. ""It's torture for her and for us.""
Jane says she is not critical of the place where Ayla is being treated, rather the system.
The ATU where she is staying said it was unable to provide comment on an individual case. But it said it, ""works with every individual to design a package of care around them, to keep them safe and help them progress back to the community"".
ATUs came under scrutiny in 2011 after the BBC's Panorama exposed horrific abuse of patients at Winterbourne View.
The government promised to end their use for those capable of living in the community with proper support through a programme called Transforming Care - which cost £10m. 
Dan Scorer, head of policy at Mencap, said: ""People are spending many, many years in there, they shouldn't be. Awful things are happening to people in there and they shouldn't be.
""And in the same way asylums were closed, these places need to be closed and people need to be supported in the community.""
NHS figures show an increase in staff resorting to medication, seclusion and even restraint when dealing with patients. Of the 2,500 incidents reported in December last year alone, 800 were against children under the age of 18.
Linda and Chris Hutchings' 27-year-old daughter lives in a secure unit in the East Midlands. She was sectioned, aged 14, after battling with an eating disorder and depression.
Her mum, Linda, says: ""I wake up in the middle of the night and I am crying because I am so sad.  
""In one of the hospitals [not the one she is currently in] she was locked in one room for nine weeks, and it was so awful for her because there was nothing apart from a telly on a high bracket on the wall.""
Chris says: ""Can you even envisage another situation where a human being is locked up on the presumption of guilt? On what they might do to themselves or others? You lose that basic right to be free.""
Birmingham City Council, which is responsible for their daughter's care, also said it could not comment on individual cases, adding, ""there are always safeguarding measures in place when somebody's liberty is limited due to illness or disability"".
Experts say the average placement cost of keeping one person in an ATU is more than £3,000 per week. 
Labour's shadow care minister, Barbara Keeley, said the government was allowing private companies to make millions, because the ATUs cost five times the amount of a community placement.
""They are like the Bedlam institutions in Victorian times,"" she said. ""This is a hidden horror. There have been 40 deaths in these units in 2015, nine of those were people under 35.""
She said the government should make a new pledge to close them down.
A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We are determined to reduce the number of people on the autism spectrum with learning disabilities in mental health hospitals, and significant investment in community support has already led to a 20% reduction. 
""The NHS is committed to reducing inpatient numbers by 35% by 2020.""
But with the right support, some parents say that the government's transformation care programme can work.
Fauzia Hussain, who has Tourette's and autism, spent 22 months in a secure unit. Her family says that she was prescribed high doses of medication, including anti-psychotic drugs and kept mostly in segregation. 
Since she has left, her life has since been transformed. 
""It was a hopeless place. I'm a child psychiatrist and I couldn't access the right support,"" her aunt Shahana says.

Pregabalin - also known by the brand name Lyrica, or the street name bud - is an anti-epileptic drug also used to relieve chronic pain.
Northern Ireland has the highest prescription rate for pregabalin in the UK.
It is illegal to have class C drugs without a prescription and illegal to supply or sell them to others.
Meanwhile the mother of a man who took his own life, speaks about her son's struggle with addiction to prescription drugs.
There will also be stronger controls in place to ensure accountability and minimise the chances of pregabalin falling into the wrong hands or being stockpiled by patients.
Deaths relating to the prescription drug are on the rise.
In 2016 eight drug deaths were linked to Lyrica misuse - one year later that figure rose to 33.
The Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs made the recommendation to reclassify the drug in a letter to ministers, including the then home secretary Theresa May, in January 2016.
The letter cited warnings from the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB), which highlighted ""significant misuse and abuse"" of the drug.
There is a growing illicit market for the drug in Northern Ireland, with many people purchasing it online from unregulated websites.
It is understood that Lyrica has been coming into Northern Ireland in fairly constant levels for a number of years, along with other prescription drugs including diazepam and temazepam.
Packages of the drug ordered by customers in Northern Ireland are intercepted by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the UK Border Agency at airports in England every week, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
While the drugs are referred to as prescription drugs, they are largely not being prescribed through community pharmacies.
They are illicitly bought or sold and supplied through the internet and largely the individuals are appearing to be using a mixture of drugs.
Joe Brogan, the HSCB's head of pharmacy and medicines management, described the growing numbers of deaths associated with pregabalin and other prescription drugs as a ""scourge"".
He added: ""In many cases of pregabalin misuse, it has not been prescribed - it has been sourced through family or friends or bought on the street or via the internet.
""Many such drugs that are bought from illicit sources do not actually contain medicines that they purport to be.
""Any medicine or any drug can be a poison - it all depends on three things: Where you get it from - was it prescribed and supplied from a regulated source?; how much you take - was it taken within accepted dosages?; what you take it with - mixing drugs together and with alcohol can create a toxic mix that is lethal.""",,,,

But just as you start to relax you find yourself clawing at your own skin, scratching at the mosquito bites that have developed on your body over the past few days. 
But it doesn't have to be this way. 
According to a recent scientific study, the way to avoid mosquito bites is to listen to electronic music - specifically dubstep, specifically by US artist Skrillex. 
Sound is ""crucial for reproduction, survival, and population maintenance of many animals,"" says a team of international scientists specialising in mosquitoes and the diseases they carry.
They subjected adults of the species Aedes aegypti, known as the yellow fever mosquito, to electronic music to see whether it could work as a repellent. 
Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites, a track by Skrillex which features on his Grammy-award winning album of the same name, was chosen because of its mix of very high and very low frequencies. 
""In insects, low-frequency vibrations facilitate sexual interactions, whereas noise disrupts the perception of signals from conspecifics [members of the same species] and hosts,"" the scientists said. 
And the results, which were published in the journal Acta Tropica, were good news for us and for Skrillex.  
Female adult mosquitoes were ""entertained"" by the track and attacked hosts later and less often than those in a dubstep-free environment. 
Scientists said ""the occurrence of blood feeding activity was lower when music was being played"".
The scientists also found that mosquitoes exposed to the song had sex ""far less often"" than mosquitoes without music.
""The observation that such music can delay host attack, reduce blood feeding, and disrupt mating provides new avenues for the development of music-based personal protective and control measures against Aedes-borne diseases.""

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-47772484,"China says it will crack down on all types of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, following a plea from the US.
All fentanyl-related substances will be added to China's list of controlled narcotic drugs from 1 May, officials said.
It follows a pledge Beijing made during US-China trade talks in December. 
The powerful painkiller, much of it believed to be made in China, is said to be driving a huge rise in drug addiction in the US.
The number of deaths from painkillers such as fentanyl led to President Donald Trump declaring a national emergency in 2017.
China's production of the drug has long been a source of tension between the two countries. 
""The US is concerned about all variants [of fentanyl] and it has all been resolved,"" Liu Yuejin, deputy director of China's narcotics control commission, told a news conference.
Mr Liu said the claim that China was the main source of fentanyl ""lacked evidence"", and instead blamed a history of abuse of prescription medicine in the US for fuelling demand.
""We believe that the United States itself is the main factor in the abuse of fentanyl there,"" he said.
""Some people link drug consumption with freedom, individuality, and liberation. If the US really wants to resolve the fentanyl substance problem they have more work to do domestically.""
Fentanyl itself is already on China's list of controlled drugs. Expanding the list to all fentanyl-related substances is aimed at stopping smugglers from changing formulas to circumvent the law.
Fentanyl is estimated to be 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine and is usually only approved in the US for severe pain arising in cases like treatment for cancer.
The US says the synthetic drug is being sold on the internet and sent by post from China, fuelling the opioid crisis.
US authorities list all fentanyl-related products in the most dangerous class of drugs.
In 2017, the US announced the first ever indictments against two Chinese individuals for conspiracy ""to distribute large quantities"" of fentanyl as well as other opioids.
The issue over fentanyl figured during a trade war between China and the US that erupted last year.
China's pledge to control the drug came during a post-G20 summit between the two countries in Buenos Aires in December.",,,,

NHS England is making PLGF testing more widely available as evidence suggests it speeds up diagnosis which could save lives.
Mums-to-be who develop pre-eclampsia have dangerously high blood pressure which can damage vital organs. 
The PLGF test tells doctors if a woman is at high, medium or low risk. 
Pre-eclampsia affects tens of thousands of pregnancies each year, but can be managed if spotted early enough. 
Those at higher risk should be very closely monitored and may have to have their baby delivered early if the condition becomes too severe despite treatment.
Sarah Findlay, 45 and from London, spent the last week of her pregnancy in hospital after medics discovered she had worryingly high blood pressure. 
""It was a really stressful time. Up until that point my pregnancy had been amazing. Everything had been going really well,"" she said.
""It was during a routine check-up that they noticed my blood pressure was far too high and they admitted me because they were concerned that it might be pre-eclampsia. 
""I went from feeling like a mum to a patient. I was really terrified because I did not know if I would be OK and whether I might lose my baby.""
Doctors closely monitored Sarah's condition and she went on to have a healthy baby girl, Isla, who is now four. 
She welcomes any test that can help predict and reassure pregnant women about their risk of pre-eclampsia. 
Trials of the new PLGF (placental growth factor) blood test, which costs about £70, show it speeds up diagnosis, meaning life-threatening complications to the mother and baby can be avoided. 
More than 1,000 women at 11 UK maternity units took part in the trials during their second and third trimesters. 
Using PLGF alongside regular blood pressure and urine checks cut the average time to diagnosis from four days to around two. 
Earlier diagnosis was linked with a lower chance of serious complications - 5.3% (24 of 447 women diagnosed with usual checks) versus 3.8% (22 of 573 women diagnosed with usual checks plus PLGF). 
Lead researcher Prof Lucy Chappell, from King's College London, said: ""This really is going to make a difference to women. The challenge for doctors is spotting which pregnancies are high risk and need closer monitoring. PLGF helps us reach that diagnosis earlier.""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Prof Tony Young, from NHS England, said: ""The NHS, with partners in government, will be making this test more widely available across the NHS as part of our plans to ensure as many patients as possible can benefit from world-class health innovations.""

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47735253,"Controversial vaginal mesh implants can be offered again on the NHS in England once certain conditions are met, health watchdog NICE has said.
Some women have been left unable to walk, work or have sex after having the implants, which are used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence.
Use of vaginal mesh was halted across the UK last year amid safety concerns.
NICE said operations must be performed by specialist surgeons at specialist centres before their reintroduction.
All instances - and outcomes - of vaginal mesh operations should also be recorded on a national database ""to help with future decision-making"", it said.
The NHS is not compelled to act on the guidelines - which are for England only - and the ""pause"" on vaginal mesh surgery remains in place.
But services are expected to take NICE recommendations into account when planning and delivering care.
Under the new guidelines, each patient would receive a ""decision aid"" - detailing all the latest evidence on available treatments - and mesh implants would be used only after non-surgical options, such as lifestyle changes and pelvic floor training, had failed.
NICE said the ""limited evidence"" meant ""the true prevalence of long-term complications following surgery with mesh is unknown"".
But Labour MP Owen Smith, who chairs a cross-party group of MPs on surgical mesh implants, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he was ""deeply disappointed"".
""The updated guidelines appear to disregard mesh-injured women's experiences by stating that there is no long-term evidence of adverse effects,"" he said.
""Thousands of women have faced life-changing injuries following mesh surgery and they must not be ignored.""
He said the suspension of vaginal mesh should continue until an independent review - led by Baroness Julia Cumberlege - publishes its findings later this year.
Baroness Cumberlege agreed, saying her team has set ""five conditions that would need to be met before the pause could be lifted and the use of mesh could be contemplated"".
""Those conditions have not yet been met and it is clear to us that it will be some considerable time before they are.
""This means that, now and for the foreseeable future, mesh should not be used to treat stress urinary incontinence, either in the NHS or the independent sector.
""The scale and intensity of this tragedy is truly shocking - lives have been ruined.""
Studies suggest as many as one in 10 patients can experience complications including chronic pain and difficulties walking.
Jackie Cheetham says she has tried to kill herself on several occasions because of the complications caused by her mesh implant.
""I have constant pain in my groin and down my leg,"" she says.
""I don't sleep at night. I can't walk far. We've lost our house, as I couldn't work anymore.
""It almost cost me my marriage. 
""I have tried to overdose several times. I felt like an unfit mother. I couldn't work and I thought, 'What's the point?'""
Ms Cheetham says when she had the implant - to treat incontinence - she was given a leaflet by her surgeon ""but it definitely didn't say I would be left in lifelong pain"".
And despite surgery to remove it, some mesh still remains inside her.
Campaign group Sling the Mesh founder Kath Sansom said the NICE guidelines were effectively ""no different from what was published in 2003"", something that NICE disputes.
""They are so weak - they clear the way for the next generation of women to be harmed,"" she said.
""We told our stories and NICE ignored us.
""Our Sling The Mesh survey shows one in 20 women have attempted suicide and more than half have regular suicidal thoughts because of chronic pain, loss of sex life, constant infections and autoimmune disease.""
An official at England's Department of Health and Social Care said: ""NICE's new guidelines and patient decision aids on managing urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse will help women make more informed choices about their treatment.
""The use of vaginal mesh was paused to ensure that patients receive a high-quality and consistent service.
""Mesh will still be a treatment for some women who understand the risks and following discussions with their consultant.""
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the British Society of Urogynaecology (BSUG) said they welcomed NICE's recommendation ""that the full range of non-surgical options should be offered to women before any surgical procedures"" and ""fully endorse"" NICE's patient decision aids.
But they added it was ""important to note"" that a period of ""high-vigilance"" remained regarding the implants' use.

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-47777103,"The countdown has begun to the launch of one of the world's boldest attempts to tackle air pollution.
From next Monday, thousands of drivers face paying a new charge to enter central London.
The aim is to deter the dirtiest vehicles in an effort to reduce diseases and premature deaths.
The initiative comes as scientists say the impacts of air pollution are more serious than previously thought.
The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC the threat of air pollution, which is mostly invisible to the naked eye, was ""a public health emergency"".
He added: ""One of the things that has troubled me is that because we can't see the particulate matter, the nitrogen dioxide, the poison, you don't take it seriously.""
But over the last few decades, research has revealed how gases like nitrogen dioxide and tiny particles, known as particulate matter or PM, can reach deep into the body with the danger of causing lasting damage.
How polluting are idling cars and buses?
Wood burners under fire in clean air plan
The most obvious effects are on our breathing - anyone suffering from asthma, for example, is more likely to be at risk, because dirty air can cause chronic problems and also trigger an attack.
""I had to stay up one night because my chest was really bad because [of] all the polluted air,"" 10-year-old Alfie told me. ""I couldn't go to sleep and my mum had to stay awake."" 
""All that polluted air can hurt your lungs, it can even damage you brain, it can damage nearly everything in your body,"" he said.
A pupil at Haimo Primary School in Eltham, close to London's busy South Circular Road, Alfie is one of 300 children across the capital taking part in unique research. 
The project involves each child wearing an air-monitoring backpack, specially built by Dyson and fitted with instruments to measure nitrogen dioxide and the smallest particles, called PM2.5.
One motivation for the work is that breathing in dirty air at an early age can have implications that last a lifetime.
Research has shown that children growing up in heavily polluted streets have smaller lung capacity than those in cleaner areas - on average by 5% according to a study in London - a limitation that cannot be reversed.
And air pollution can exacerbate other respiratory conditions too, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and lung cancer is thought to be linked as well. 
Dr Ben Barrett of King's College London, who is running the backpack research, says that children born in a more polluted environment face greater challenges in life.
""It's not necessarily that there's a particular disease that they develop but their body is less able to cope with those challenges as they go into adolescence and into old age.""
Another pathway to harm is opened up when the smallest particles find their way into the depths of the lungs, to the alveoli, from where oxygen is transferred into the bloodstream.
It's been established that PM2.5 particles are small enough to make that transition as well, entering the cardiovascular system and circulating throughout the body.
The risks of this include the potential for blocking the arteries, increasing the danger of stroke, along with heart disease and heart attacks. 
Beyond that, there's evidence that the particles can reach the brain so researchers are investigating the potential effects on conditions such as dementia. 
London's dirty air: How bad is it?
Major cities move to ban diesel vehicles 
A major Chinese study last year proposed a connection between pollution and lowered cognitive performance, while a British study published last week suggested a link to psychotic episodes in teenagers. 
According to Prof Jonathan Grigg of Queen Mary University London, a leading figure in research into the effects of air pollution on children, the evidence for wide-ranging impacts is growing.
""We're absolutely certain that air pollution is associated with respiratory disease such as asthma and with cardiovascular disease with heart attacks and strokes, and in five years we'll be more certain about other conditions like dementia and obesity.""
One new area of research is the hunt for an explanation for why babies in the most polluted areas tend to be born more prematurely and underweight compared with those born elsewhere. 
A small study, still under way, is investigating placentas and has found black dots that look similar to pollution particles spotted in lung cells. 
One of the researchers involved in the work, Norrice Liu, also at Queen Mary University, said the placenta would be expected to provide a sterile environment so the sight of black dots was a surprise. 
""We know what pollution particles look like when they're in the cells elsewhere in the body particularly in the lungs, and the black bits that we're seeing in the placenta are a very similar shape and colour to those what making us think they could be pollution particles.""
Their presence does not prove a link with premature birth or lower birthweight but it does suggest a possible mechanism.
Fifteen young mothers have so far agreed to donate their placentas to the study, and one of them, Rachel Buswell, told me that of all her concerns while pregnant, air pollution was not one of them.
""It's pretty scary,"" she said, ""you protect yourself when you find out you're pregnant in as many ways as you can and that's going to be something people can't protect themselves as easily, living in London especially, it is quite frightening.""",,,,

If so, you're not alone as evidence suggests a significant proportion of the population has difficulties. 
Usually, it's not a big thing. But, in medicine, adverse events caused by left-right issues can have serious consequences. 
A new study from Queen's University Belfast has questioned the idea that determining left from right is effortless for everyone. 
It has said that medical education should respond by raising awareness about the challenges some medical students face.
In addition to the many checks and balances in healthcare to prevent such errors, the study has also called for greater support to be extended in medical students training. 
Mr Ian Walsh is a surgeon and an academic at Queen's. 
While re-creating a simple investigation with a group of fourth-year medical students, he illustrates how left and right awareness come into play in everyday situations for medical professionals. 
He shows them an X-ray of a set of lungs - the left lung has fluid in it. 
As viewed straight on, the 2D X-rays appear to flip the left and right sides - in that a student will see the left-hand lung on the right side of the screen. 
It's vitally important that the medical students are aware of this and also examine the patient themselves before they proceed to treat the patient by draining the lung.
The new research paper, which is to be published in the journal Medical Education, was led by Prof Gerry Gormley from the Centre for Medical Education at Queens. 
It looked at how, for some of us, making left-right decisions is simple - but for others is it's much more problematic. 
""In terms of spatial awareness, generally we don't confuse above and below, behind and in front - but left and right can pose a challenge for some people. 
""It's a relatively under-researched area and still there is a lot to be known about this particular topic. 
""We know that many individuals can, without thinking, determine the correct side.
""However, for others they have to go through a complex process and use many higher functions to discriminate left from right.""
So this simple skill is actually more complex than it first appears - and it's crucial those in medicine get it right. 
Dr Carl Brennan also worked on the research. He said that some students developed their own coping mechanisms. 
""One of the most common common ones can be with their hands - where on their left hand they form the 'L' shape.
""There are a number of others - wearing their wristwatch or wedding band on their left side or writing with their right.""
Queens University is at the forefront of a field of study called Human Factors. 
Simply put, in healthcare, it looks at how professionals best interact and behave with their environment, equipment and other people in the interests of patient safety. 
It can show medical professionals how best to communicate in teams and effectively handover increasingly complex information to others in healthcare. 
Mr Walsh explains its application to left-right issues. 
""This addresses beyond the more technical issues - for example where you mark the right limb to make sure you take off the correct limb, for example. 
""It looks at improving quality by looking at how we behave, how we think and how we interact.""
Prof Gormley said it's important to translate this type of research into practice. 
""In our future simulation centre, in addition to what we are already doing we can bring students together with drama students, for example. 
""They can really re-create challenging situations but also the emotions and the situational awareness so that our medical students can convert their thoughts into correct actions to hopefully reduce error and deliver high quality care.""",,,,
1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47707954,"A speedy 'non-surgical' nose job that takes just minutes may be possible using tiny needles and an electric current, US researchers believe. 
Bendy cartilage structures - like ears and the tip of the nose - can be remodelled with electromechanical reshaping (EMR), they claim. 
It would be done under local anaesthetic, saving patients cuts, stitches and scars, a science conference in Florida heard.
No human tests have been done yet. 
The researchers have tried EMR on animals. It was able to change a rabbit's ears from upright to bent. 
Cartilage is rubbery to the touch, but is made up of tiny strands of a protein, called collagen, linked together by other small proteins.
It is flexible, yet holds its shape. 
EMR involves passing an electric current through the tissue (via small needles) to make the cartilage pliable for reshaping. 
One of the researchers, Dr Michael Hill, said: ""Once the tissue is floppy you can mould it to whatever shape you want.""
The researchers believe that once the tissue has been reshaped and allowed to 'set' or harden for a few minutes (with the current off), the change should be permanent.
Dr Hill and his colleague Prof Brian Wong, from the University of California, told the American Chemical Society meeting that EMR could be useful for treating other conditions, such as tight tendons and vision problems caused by the shape of the front of the eye (the cornea). 
Prof Iain Whitaker is a plastic surgeon at Swansea University Medical School and a member of the British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. 
He said although the work was interesting, it was much too soon to tell whether it might be something that could be offered to patients. 
""It's always good to look for new ways to reduce the invasiveness of surgery but it could be tricky to move this work into human trials,"" he said. 
""You'd need ethical and regulatory approval, and to know that it was safe. 
""If it works like the researchers hope, then I can see how it might be useful for reshaping something like prominent ears. 
""Noses might be a bit more limited because about a third of the nose is bone. You might be able to reshape the nasal tip perhaps.""
A concern is whether manipulating the cartilage might damage it. 
""It's not exactly clear yet how this procedure works. We don't know if the integrity will hold up and there could be a risk of adverse results,"" he said. 
Dr Hill said the procedure involves temporarily changing the acidity or pH of tissues and that it would be important to make sure this did not cause any damaging side effects before doing human trials or offering it to patients. More tests are needed.
Rhinoplasty, or nose reshaping, is an operation, done under general anaesthetic (meaning the patient is asleep), to change the shape or size of the nose. 
If you are getting it done for cosmetic reasons, it is unlikely that the NHS will provide it and you will have to pay (upwards of around £4,500). 
The surgeon may remove or rearrange the cartilage and bone in the nose and make cuts to the covering skin (open rhinoplasty) or inside the nostrils (closed rhinoplasty).
Nose reshaping surgery can occasionally result in:

It found Brits, younger people and those on higher incomes were more likely to have chemsex.
More than 22,000 people took part in the Global Drug Survey's research into substance-linked sex.
It found alcohol, cannabis, MDMA and cocaine are the drugs most commonly used.
Researchers say understanding people's drug use is important so that messages about the harm they can cause can be targeted to the way people live their lives.
""By engaging with your audience and accepting that drugs provide pleasure as well as harms, you can deliver harm reduction messages in a more trustworthy and nuanced manner,"" said lead author Dr Will Lawn.
The report found alcohol was the most popular drug. 
Around 58% of men and 60% of women who took part in the survey said they'd drank before sex in the past year.
But it's not just booze that's being consumed before Brits get intimate.
The report states that people from the UK are most likely to have combined drugs such as cocaine, MDMA and mephedrone with sex.
It describes the Brit's use of mephedrone - also known as meow meow - with sex as ""particularly striking"".
The report said that while people of all genders and sexual orientations had chemsex - gay and bisexual men were ""more likely to have done so"".
It also found that ""homosexual men were 1.6 times as likely as heterosexual men to have used drugs with the specific intent of enhancing the sexual experience in the last year"".
Dr Lawn, from the University College London, said that while chemsex is often associated with gay men, the study found ""men and women of all sexual orientations engaged in this behaviour"".
""Harm reduction messages relating to substance-linked sex in general should therefore not only be targeted towards gay and bisexual men, as they are relevant to all groups.""
Marc Thompson, who leads health improvement at sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, says combining drugs with sex can increase the chance of catching an STI. 
""Drug use can lead to people taking risks during sex they wouldn't ordinarily take which increases the chances of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and why testing regularly is really important,"" he told Newsbeat.
""As this report highlights, drug use and sex is something that is not exclusive to gay and bisexual men but is something that happens across the wider population. 
""Therefore it's vital that everyone knows the potential risks this can result in.""
The people who responded to the survey were ""self-selecting rather than a representative sample"", the research noted.
It means the number of people who said they combine drugs with sex will be ""substantially larger than the general population"".
""However, relative differences between groups are expected to be reliable,"" it added.

The men refused to say which one of them had fathered the child, assuming they would then be able to escape having to pay.
A DNA test proved inconclusive because of their identical twin status.
The judge said the two men were taking away from the young girl the right to know who her biological father was.
Each man will have to pay 230 reais; ($60; £45) a month, or 30% of the minimum salary in Brazil, as maintenance.

Cecile Eledge carried the daughter of her son Matthew Eledge and his husband Elliot Dougherty to term, giving birth to baby Uma Louise last week. 
Mrs Eledge said she made the offer when her son and Mr Dougherty first said they wanted to start a family.
""Of course, they all laughed,"" Mrs Eledge told the BBC.
Mrs Eledge, who was 59 at the time, said her suggestion remained a sort of joke among family at first, not a realistic path forward.  
""It just seemed like a really beautiful sentiment on her part,"" Mr Dougherty said. ""She's such a selfless woman.""  
But when Mr Eledge and Mr Dougherty, who live in Omaha close to Mrs Eledge and her husband, began exploring options to have a baby they were told by a fertility doctor that it could be a viable option.
Mrs Eledge was brought in for an interview and a series of tests, all of which gave a green light to the surrogacy. 
""I'm very health conscious,"" she said. ""There was no reason whatsoever to doubt that I could carry the baby."" 
With Mr Eledge providing the sperm, Mr Dougherty's sister Lea served as the egg donor. 
Mr Dougherty, who works as a hairdresser, said that while straight couples may consider IVF the last resort, for them it was their ""only hope"" for a biological child. 
""We always knew we had to be unique and think outside the box with this,"" Mr Eledge, a public school teacher, added. 
Mrs Eledge said the pregnancy was smooth throughout, the regular symptoms simply ""elevated a little bit"" compared to her previous pregnancies with her three children. 
In fact, the most obvious sign of her age came less than a week after Mrs Eledge was implanted with the embryo, when Mr Eledge and Mr Dougherty bought her a home pregnancy test to see if the transfer had been successful. 
""We were told not to, but the boys couldn't wait,"" Mrs Eledge said, laughing. 
She looked at the test and was devastated to see the results were negative. But when Mr Eledge came over later that day to comfort her, he saw something she hadn't: a second pink line on the test, confirming a pregnancy.
""That was really a joyous moment,"" Mrs Eledge said, accompanied by jokes about her failing eyesight. 
""She can't see anything, but she'll be able to deliver,"" Mrs Eledge recalls Mr Eledge and Mr Dougherty saying. 
Mrs Eledge said the response to her pregnancy has been mostly positive, accompanied by a slight ""shock factor,"" particularly for her two other children, Mr Eledge's siblings. 
""When everyone got the full picture it was nothing but support,"" she said. 
But the pregnancy exposed some persistent markers of discrimination against LGBT families in Nebraska. Though gay marriage has been legal in the state since the landmark Supreme Court decision in 2015, Nebraska has no state laws banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. Up until 2017, the state maintained a decades-old ban on gay and lesbian foster parents.  
Mrs Eledge said she fought, unsuccessfully, with her insurance company over health expenses that would have been covered if she was giving birth to her own child. And due to a law designating the person who delivers the baby as mother, Uma's birth certificate lists Mrs Eledge alongside her son, and excludes Mr Dougherty.
""This is just one small, micro example of the things that create road blocks for us,"" Mr Eledge said. 
Mr Eledge made headlines four years ago when he was dismissed from his job at Skutt Catholic High School after he informed school administrators that he and Mr Dougherty planned to get married. 
Mr Eledge's treatment sparked outrage in his community, prompting parents and former and current students to create an online petition calling for an ""end to employment discrimination against Mr Eledge and future faculty"". 
The petition, now closed, garnered 102,995 supporters. 
Typically a private family, Mrs Eledge says they chose to share their story to counter these examples of ""hate"" towards LGBT individuals and families, and convey ""that there's always hope out there"". 
""I'm learning not to take it personally,"" said Mr Eledge of the negative responses to him and his family. ""At the end of the day, we have a family, we have friends, we have a huge community that supports us."" 
And week after Uma's birth, Mrs Eledge says that she and her granddaughter are doing well.

The move reverses Mr Trump's call last week to quickly scrap ex-President Obama's signature law, which surprised some Republicans in Congress.
It comes as the justice department backed a lawsuit aiming to strike down the healthcare law as unconstitutional.
At least 20 million people could lose health coverage if the law is scrapped.
It is unclear with what Republicans would replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, if the courts rule to abolish the law before the 2020 presidential election. 
In a series of tweets on Monday evening, Mr Trump wrote that a ""vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House"".
Many political pundits say that healthcare was a galvanising issue for Democrats, who won control of the House of Representatives, during the mid-term elections in 2018.
The president's decision comes a week after he called for an immediate replacement to the existing law, declaring the Republican Party would be ""the party of healthcare"". 
Mr Trump met Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill, some of whom later said the White House did not offer any plan for a new law during their talks.
""Do we have a plan? What's our plan?"" Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said after their meeting.
""He didn't offer a plan,"" Senator Marco Rubio of Florida also said. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is up for re-election in 2020, told reporters: ""I look forward to seeing what the president is proposing and what he can work out with the speaker.""
The announcement followed the Department of Justice decision to back a federal judge's December ruling that found all of Obamacare unconstitutional.
The move was seen as a dramatic reversal, as the White House had previously only called for stripping the law of some provisions.
On Wednesday, former White House legislative affairs director Marc Short, who is currently working for Vice-President Mike Pence, told CNN that ""the president will be putting forward plans this year"" to replace Obamacare.
Republicans had attempted to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare on several occasions in 2017 when Mr Trump's party controlled both chambers of Congress, but failed after Republicans were unable to reach a consensus over what law should replace it.
Eliminating Obamacare has long been on the Republican party's wishlist, and was a key campaign promise from Mr Trump.
Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington
For six years Republicans promised their supporters that action on healthcare - full Obamacare repeal and a cheaper, better replacement - was just a winning election away. They needed to take the House, then the Senate, then the presidency. Then in 2016 they won - everything - and ran into a brick wall, as attempts at ""repeal and replace"" foundered.
Now, much to the dismay of congressional Republicans, Donald Trump wants to try again. First he signed his administration on to a long-shot lawsuit to get the entire Obamacare system invalidated. Then he announced that healthcare reform would be a priority for his party. 
For Republicans, this is a bridge too far. Memories of their 2018 mid-term defeats, in which Democrats ran on protecting Obamacare, are still fresh. The last thing they want is to refight those battles - with the added possibility of a court decision throwing the whole system into chaos.
Perhaps that's why the president on Tuesday backed away from his promises of a new plan soon, instead announcing that an excellent, but still undefined, healthcare reform would be passed as soon as Republicans won total control of the government in 2020.
Conservative healthcare reform is only an election away. Again.
Speaking at a rally outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer told the crowd that Republicans will not have a healthcare proposal until 2021.
""Translation: they have no health care plan. It's the same old song they've been singing. They're for repeal. They have no replace.""
""What a ruse. What a shame. What a disgrace... The American people will not stand for the president playing cynical games with health care,"" he continued.
Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn, the second highest ranking Republican in the chamber, said Mr Trump's announcement does not remove the pressure on his party to come up with a replacement.
""That's one man's timetable,"" he told the Washington Post. ""But I intend to continue to try to find ways to provide more affordable choices for people when it comes to their health care.""
South Dakota Republican Senator John Thune said the decision was ""just probably a realistic assessment of what the field looks like for the next couple of years,"" in a reference to the Democrats' control of the House of Representatives.",,,,

""We're undecided but are swaying towards not getting the baby vaccinated,"" Mark tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. 
He and his wife, Victoria, are expecting their first child in August but he is stepfather to her two teenage children, who are both vaccinated.
Experts say the MMR vaccine is safe and has been given to millions of children worldwide.
Vaccinations prevent two to three million deaths globally ever year, World Health Organisation data shows.
But NHS England fears ""vaccination deniers"" are gaining traction on social media, with half of parents with young children being exposed to anti-vaccination content.
Mark and Victoria say they have been researching the topic mostly online. 
""People tend to take things at face value,"" he says. ""You've got a professional who says something and you take that as being [true]. 
""But it's good to do your own research and go out there and question the questions or question the answers, no matter where it's coming from.""
They are not alone. 
Figures from data company SEMrush, seen by the programme, show a 296% increase in searches about the measles, mumps, and rubella virus (MMR) vaccine in the past 12 months in the UK, while the search term ""anti-vaccine"" has increased by 171%.
The number of two-year-olds having the MMR vaccine in England is at its lowest in eight years, with 91.2% vaccinated last year.
In 2018, there were 966 confirmed measles cases in England, nearly four times as many as the total number confirmed the previous year.
Victoria and Mark met Prof Beate Kampmann, director of the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, to ask her about one of their prime concerns. 
""Why do you think it's acceptable to inject aluminium into babies when it's being banned in things such as aerosols?"" asks Mark.
Prof Kampmann says many people are concerned about the extra ingredients in vaccines. 
""Alum is a very important part of the vaccines because it actually helps the stuff that's really important in the vaccine, which is the bacterial viral ingredients, to work well in the body,"" she says. 
""You make it sound like we're giving a massive shot of aluminium to the body... - that's not at all the case.
""The concentration is only a 1,000th of what you'd find in the natural environment and what we already have in our bodies.""
Mark says the information leaflets in vaccine packaging are not always offered to parents before injections. And some he and Victoria have seen say they should not be administered if the child is allergic - but how would parents know?
Prof Kampmann says the main allergy concern is some vaccines, such as MMR, contain traces of egg. 
""You know if you have a demonstrated egg allergy,"" she says. 
""You should be pointing that out. 
""And by the time the baby gets that particular vaccine, you would know if they did... or not because they would have had egg in all sorts of products.""
Dr Julian Spinks, of Court View medical practice, in Rochester, addresses another of the couple's concerns - why GP surgeries are paid for each vaccination. 
""We're just wondering whether GPs are pressurised to meet targets for financial gain?"" Mark says.
Dr Spinks says they do have some targets but the money involved is relatively small. 
""The amount of money we get for a vaccine is about £10,"" he says.
""By the time you've covered the costs we have, which is recording people, paying for nurses and people and so on, well over half of that is gone. 
""So actually, realistically, it's a very small amount of money we get.""
Mark and Victoria are also worried the NHS may be too quick to offer vaccinations - without fully explaining potential risks.
Dr Spinks says: ""I don't think information is being suppressed as such [but] maybe people could get more.
""One of the difficulties is that a lot of the anti-vaccination sites will raise very obscure things, which it would be impossible to cover in a short leaflet. 
""It doesn't mean we won't answer questions.""
Mark then asks: ""Why is it not fully explained to parents that immunisations are optional?"" 
And Dr Spinks says he always tells parents they are voluntary, even though he would very strongly recommend them.
""It ultimately is the parents' choice,"" he says, ""but I do have concerns because I do believe immunisation protects and it's protecting your child and it's also protecting the children around them, because of this thing of actually suppressing spread of the virus from one child to another.""
Mark and Victoria say meeting Prof Kampmann and Dr Spinks was ""enlightening and informative"".
""We were pleased that the professionals could empathise,"" Mark says, ""and some felt there needed to be more info out there and training for health professionals. 
""Hopefully other parents now feel comfortable to come forwards.""

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47734296,"The food we eat is putting 11 million of us into an early grave each year, an influential study shows. 
The analysis, in the Lancet, found that our daily diet is a bigger killer than smoking and is now involved in one in five deaths around the world. 
Salt - whether in bread, soy sauce or processed meals - shortened the highest number of lives.
Researchers say this study is not about obesity, but ""poor quality"" diets damaging hearts and causing cancer. 
The Global Burden of Disease Study is the most authoritative assessment of how people are dying in every country in the world.
The latest analysis used estimates of countries' eating habits to pin down how often diet was shortening lives. 
The dangerous diets were those containing: 
Low levels of nuts, seeds, vegetables, omega-3 from seafood and fibre were the other major killers.
""We find that diet is one of the dominant drivers of health around the world, it's really quite profound,"" Prof Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington told the BBC.
About 10 million out of the 11 million diet-related deaths were because of cardiovascular disease and that explains why salt is such a problem.
Too much salt raises blood pressure and that in turn raises the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
Salt can also have a direct effect on the heart and blood vessels, leading to heart failure when the organ does not work effectively. 
Whole grains, fruit and vegetables have the opposite effect - they are ""cardioprotective"" and lower the risk of heart problems.
Cancers and type 2 diabetes made up the rest of the diet-related deaths.
No country is perfect and each favours some part of a healthy diet more than others, but this is how far the world is from an optimal diet.
The healthy foods missing from the most diets around the world were nuts and seeds, according to the study. 
Eager readers will have noticed  they featured heavily in the planetary health diet, unveiled in January, to save lives, save the planet and feed 10 billion people. 
So why don't we munch them?
Prof Nita Forouhi, from the University of Cambridge, said: ""The perception is they are little packs of energy that will make you fat, whereas they are packed full of good fats.
""And most people don't see them as mainstream food; and the other issue is cost.""  
The huge fat versus sugar debate and the link between red and processed meats with cancer have attracted huge headlines in recent years. 
""These can be harmful as we show, but they are much smaller issues than low whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetable intake,"" said Prof Murray.
Although, the study did show too many fizzy drinks were being drunk in every corner of the world. 
The researchers say it is time for health campaigns to switch from talking about nutrients like fat and sugar and instead promote healthy foods.
Bad diets are knocking a couple of years off life expectancies around the world, according to the researchers.
But Prof Murray warns this is just the average and says the real question we should be asking is: ""Am I going to die in my 50s from a heart attack? Or am I going to have some of the diet-related cancers in my 40s?""
Mediterranean countries, particularly France, Spain and Israel, have some of the lowest numbers of diet-related deaths in the world. 
Countries in South East, Southern and Central Asia are at the opposite end of the spectrum. 
Japan and China have curiously contrasting fortunes that reflect their changing relationship with salt.
China consumes enormous amounts of salt with soy and other salty sauces being a key part of the country's cuisine. 
But the rising popularity of processed foods is introducing yet more salt to their diet. It has the highest death rate because of salt of any country. 
Prof Murray said: ""Japan is very interesting because if you go back 30 to 40 years, they like China today had enormous salt intake.
""Salt is still their number one problem, but it has come down dramatically, 
""And they have a diet that is higher in many of the things we think are protective for heart disease such as vegetables and fruit.""
The UK is behind countries like France, Denmark and Belgium.
The biggest problems are a lack of whole grains, fruit, vegetables and nuts and seeds.  
The study estimates 14% of UK deaths are related to diet, with 127 diet-related deaths per 100,000 people a year.
Prof Murray said: ""Diet quality matters no matter what weight you are. 
""The really big story for people to act on is increase your whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetable intake and reduce salt if you can.""
But money is an issue. 
It is estimated that having your five fruit and veg a day would take up 52% of household income in poorer countries. 
But Prof Forouhi warns: ""The public can make healthier choices if informed and have the resources, but if what is on the shelves as buy-one-get-one-free is always unhealthy, then that message will fall down.
""Cheaper options that are healthy are badly needed."" 
Both agreed there needed to be a shift from focusing on nutrients (fat/sugar/salt) and on to which actual foods people should eat.

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-47803975,"The routine vaccination of girls with the HPV vaccine in Scotland has led to a ""dramatic"" drop in cervical disease in later life, new research suggests. 
Human papilomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted infection and some types are linked to cervical cancer. 
Researchers said the vaccine has nearly wiped out cases of cervical pre-cancer in young women since an immunisation programme was introduced 10 years ago. 
They found the vaccine had led to a 90% cut in pre-cancerous cells. 
And they said the effects of the programme had ""exceeded expectations"". 
Over the last decade, schoolgirls across the UK have routinely received the HPV vaccine when they are 12 or 13. 
The uptake of the vaccine in Scotland is about 90%.
A team of academics - from Strathclyde, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow Caledonian universities - analysed vaccination and screening records for 140,000 women who went for their first cervical screen from 2008-2016. 
Their study, published by the BMJ, concluded that Scotland's HPV vaccination programme has led to ""a dramatic reduction in preinvasive cervical disease"".
It adds that the vaccine is ""highly effective"" and should greatly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in the future.
Source: NHS Choices
Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women under 35 in UK.
""The findings will need to be considered by cervical cancer prevention programmes worldwide"", the study reports. 
When the vaccination programme began, researchers thought that the vaccine would knock out two types of HPV, which cause 80% of pre-cancerous conditions. 
Instead, they have found it knocks out another three types as well, which means it eliminates nearer 90% of cervical pre-cancer in Scotland. 
Unvaccinated women also showed a reduction in disease, suggesting that the interruption of HPV transmission in Scotland has created substantial ""herd protection"", researchers said.
Recent studies have also suggested that HPV plays a part in causing other cancers, particularly head-and-neck, vulvo-vaginal and anal cancers. 
Dr Kevin Pollock, of Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ""impressive"" figures confirm that ""the HPV vaccine should significantly reduce cervical cancer in the next few years"". 
He added: ""The main message is that the vaccine works. As long as the high uptake continues, the virus has got nowhere to go and it is being eliminated. 
""We assessed 140,000 women in this study and because we can link status of vaccination to the disease its impact is indisputable.""
Laura McAdam, 33, said she wishes the HPV vaccine had been available when she was at school. 
In 2016, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer after a routine smear test found changes in her cervix - despite having no symptoms.
Laura said she wished she had the opportunity to get the HPV vaccine at school. She said: ""If this injection they are giving at schools now is wiping this out then that is amazing news and I'm definitely all for it.
""I think it's a great idea. I don't see why anybody wouldn't want to get it.
""I would take it in a heartbeat if it's going to stop anyone going through what I've been through.""
""You never expect it to happen to you"", she added. 
Due to complications she was unable to have chemotherapy or radiotherapy, so to remove the cancer she had laser treatment, a hysterectomy and lymph nodes removed. 
Ms McAdam, from Ayrshire, does not know whether her cancer will return, so has to have checks every six months.
She added: ""Although I've had treatment I don't think my nightmare will ever really be over as I'll constantly be worrying if they got all the cancer or if it's come back.
""I would advise all girls to get vaccinated because there is proof that it works. I would also advise women to go for smear tests. It was a smear test that saved my life.
""I wouldn't wish what has happened to me on my worst enemy."" 
The research has been welcomed by Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust. The charity's chief executive Robert Music said: ""The findings of this research are highly exciting and clearly demonstrate the impact of the HPV vaccine in protecting the cervical health of future generations. 
""We are lucky to have such an effective prevention programme which means the elimination of cervical cancer is firmly on the horizon. 
""Focusing on communities and areas where take up is below the national average should be a priority.""
Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick MSP said he welcomed the report in the BMJ. He said it demonstrated ""the significant and continued benefits of our vaccination programme"". 
The study showed the programme ""will save lives"" and that plans were in place to ""build on this success"" by extending the HPV vaccine programme to boys later this year.
He added: ""It remains important that women continue to take up the invitation for their regular cervical screening as we know it saves lives.
""The test is unique as it can prevent the disease before it even begins, and treatment as a result of screening prevents eight out of 10 cervical cancers from developing.""",,,,
1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47776902,"Failing to apply moisturiser with sun protection factor (SPF) and sunscreen properly to the face, particularly around eyes, could be putting people at risk of skin cancer, a study suggests.
Researchers found differences in the way people applied sunscreen and SPF moisturiser.
More skin is missed with moisturiser - especially the eyelids, where the skin is thin and more vulnerable to cancer.
Sunglasses with UV filters can help protect missed areas, the experts said.
Many moisturisers are sold with SPFs of 30-50, similar to the level of traditional sunscreens, but they are not intended to be a replacement for sunscreen if spending long periods of time outdoors in the summer.
The research team at the University of Liverpool studied how 84 people (62 women and 22 men) put on both moisturiser and sunscreen, then took photos with a UV-sensitive camera showing how well they had covered their faces.
The researchers found that nearly 17% of the face was missed with SPF moisturiser compared with 11% for sunscreen.
And there was 21% lower coverage of the area around the eyelids with moisturiser and 14% with sunscreen, the study in PLOS One found.
These are the areas most vulnerable to skin cancer, but people were unaware they had not covered them, said Austin McCormick, study author and consultant ophthalmic and oculoplastic surgeon, from Aintree University Hospital Trust.
""The eyelid skin is very thin and this puts it at risk of UV damage,"" he said.
""The area around the eyelashes and between the eyelids and the nose is least likely to be covered.""
Mr McCormick said that eyelid cancers accounted for 10% of all basal cell carcinomas in the UK, the most common type of skin cancer, so people should pay particular attention to the eyelid area when putting on any SPF cream.
Moisturiser may be used more sparingly because it is often expensive, sold in smaller amounts and is seen as a ""precious cream"", he said.
""If planning prolonged sun exposure, we advise sunscreen be used.
""If using moisturiser, we advise one with SPF: any SPF is better than none, but it should not be considered the equal of sunscreen,"" Mr McCormick said.
Holly Barber, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said the formulas in SPF moisturisers were less likely to be rub-resistant and water-resistant if applied more thinly.
But she said it was surprising that people were not more hesitant to apply sunscreen around the eyes - because it can make them sting.
""A good way to avoid problems such as sunburn in areas missed when applying sun protection is to make use of protective clothing such as sun hats and sunglasses, as well as reapplying regularly,"" she said.
Sunscreen is really only necessary when planning to spend half an hour or more in summer sunshine. If you are just popping out at lunchtime it is unlikely that you will need sunscreen, especially if you applied a moisturiser with SPF that morning or are in and out of the shade of buildings and trees.
They are fine for offering some protection if you are going out briefly. But if you intend spending some time outdoors, especially between April and September, then sunscreens are much more effective. 
Moisturisers providing SPF do not bind as well to the skin as sunscreen, and so are not intended to provide adequate protection for extended periods in the sun. 
In the winter months, UV protection in the UK is not necessary - except in people who are abnormally sensitive to sunlight. We all need some sun exposure, which provides us with important vitamin D.
However, this has to be balanced with the risk of skin damage in hotter months. This is not directly related to how hot it is, but to the UV index. 
Although this is generally higher on cloudless, hot days than on cloudy, cool days, you should not rely on temperature alone as a guide to the need for sun protection.

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47817650,"Even light-to-moderate drinking increases blood pressure and the chances of having a stroke, according to a large genetic study in The Lancet, countering previous claims that one or two drinks a day could be protective.
The UK and Chinese researchers followed 500,000 Chinese people for 10 years.
They say the findings are relevant to all populations and the best evidence yet on the direct effects of alcohol. 
Experts said people should limit their alcohol consumption.
It is already known that heavy drinking is harmful to health and increases stroke risk - but some studies have suggested drinking small amounts can be good for the health, while others indicate there is no safe level of alcohol consumption.
The researchers, from the University of Oxford, Peking University and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, found that:
For the purposes of their study, one drink was defined as either:
About 16 in 100 men and 20 in 100 women will have a stroke in their lifetime in the UK.
So, if a group of 100 non-drinkers started drinking a glass or two every day, there would be an extra two strokes - a small increase.
According to Prof David Spiegelhalter, from the University of Cambridge, that's an increase in total stroke risk of 38% for every half a bottle of wine drunk per day.
He said: ""It is very roughly the opposite effect of taking a statin"", which are drugs prescribed by doctors to help lower cholesterol levels in the blood and prevent heart attacks and strokes.
The study also found no evidence of light or moderate drinking having a protective effect, in other words, reducing the risk of stroke.
When it came to the effect of alcohol on heart attack risk, the researchers said the effects were not clear cut and more data needed to be collected over the next few years.
""Claims that wine and beer have magical protective effects is not borne out,"" said study author Prof Richard Peto, professor of medical statistics and epidemiology at the University of Oxford.
East Asian countries are useful places to study the effects of alcohol.
Many people with Chinese ancestry have a combination of genes that puts them off drinking alcohol. It causes an unpleasant reaction and makes them feel unwell.
As a result, there is a wide variation of alcohol intake in China - one in three men doesn't drink and very few women do.
But by comparing the health outcomes of drinkers and non-drinkers according to their genetic profile, scientists say they have been able to assess - with much more certainty than before - the direct effects of alcohol on stroke risk, distinct from any other factors.
Western populations don't possess these genes, so it would be impossible to carry out a similar study here.
And most studies are observational, which makes it's difficult to judge which factor is causing what effect.
Dr Iona Millwood, study author and senior epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, said: ""Our genetic analyses have helped us understand the cause and effect relationships.""
The researchers say their key message is that there is now clear evidence of no protective effect of moderate drinking on stroke.
That means drinking even small amounts of alcohol each day can increase the chances of having a stroke.
This is reflected in the current UK guidance - which advises a limit of 14 units of alcohol a week, with several alcohol-free days to keep health risks low.
Dr Stephen Burgess, from the University of Cambridge, said there were some limitations to the study - that it only looked at a Chinese population and focused mainly on the drinking of spirits and beer, not wine.
But he said the research reflected the culmination of many years of research into the impact of alcohol consumption. 
""It strongly suggests that there is no cardiovascular benefit of light drinking and that risk of stroke increases even with moderate light alcohol consumption,"" he said.
""Risk of stroke increases proportionally with the amount of alcohol consumed, so if people do choose to drink, then they should limit their alcohol consumption."" 
Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said the study didn't answer every question.
""It has certainly advanced what we know about the role of alcohol in some diseases but it can't be the last word,"" he said.
""The new study doesn't tie down exactly how alcohol works to increase stroke risk but doesn't appear to increase heart attack risk."" 
Prof David Spiegelhalter, Winton professor for the public understanding of risk, at the University of Cambridge, said the study was making him waver.
""I have always been reasonably convinced that moderate alcohol consumption was protective for cardiovascular disease, but now I am having my doubts,"" he said.",,,,
1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47800438,"Measles is one of the world's most infectious illnesses but until recently cases had been declining. So what's led to recent outbreaks?
Rockland County, in New York state, declared a state of emergency following a severe re-emergence of the preventable virus. 
It's far from an isolated case, with the US already on course this year to see the most measles cases since 2000, when the disease was officially eliminated.  
Other countries, such as Mexico, France and Madagascar, have seen similar outbreaks in communities with gaps in immunity.
In most cases, measles is relatively minor but it can also lead to potentially life-threatening complications such as pneumonia, meningitis and brain inflammation.
Although still far below historical levels, the disease has been on the rise for several years. Reported cases rose by 31% in 2017 on the year before, leading to about 110,000 deaths worldwide.    
According to Unicef, 98 countries reported an increase in measles cases in 2018, with almost three-quarters of these occurring in 10 countries.  
Successful vaccination programmes have ensured measles has become rare in many places. 
When a measles vaccine became widely used in the 1980s, cases fell significantly, eventually leading some countries to declare it had been eliminated.  
Before then, large epidemics of measles occurred every few years. 
For example, in 1967, the year before measles vaccine was introduced in England and Wales, there were almost half a million reported cases and 99 deaths. By 1998, this had fallen to an all-time low of 56 cases and no deaths. 
So what accounts for the alarming recent increases?
A vaccination target of 95% creates ""herd immunity"" in a community, to prevent this highly infectious disease from spreading.
All the measles outbreaks have taken hold in areas where there is not enough immunity but the reasons behind this differ from place to place. 
The high-profile anti-vaccination movement has become influential in parts of the US and Europe. 
Despite overwhelming scientific evidence supporting vaccination, ""anti-vaxxers"" can believe vaccines are unnecessary or harmful. 
They sometimes embrace conspiracy theories around ""big pharma"" and are distrustful of government.  
In the UK, a scare over the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, following now discredited research, had a major impact for a time. 
In 2004, first-dose MMR coverage fell to 80% in England and 78% in Wales
Two decades on, uptake has recovered, with over 90% of UK two-year-olds receiving the vaccine in 2017-18. 
But many adolescents and young adults not given the MMR as infants are now catching measles. 
We may also see future outbreaks of rubella - German measles - in this age group, a particular concern as they reach childbearing age. 
Usually a mild disease, rubella can be catastrophic if caught in the early stages of pregnancy, causing serious vision, hearing, heart and learning problems in the unborn baby.
In other countries, reasons behind falling vaccination rates are very different. 
In Ukraine, for example, public trust in vaccination was severely shaken in 2008, following the death of a teenager after a measles vaccination, which, although unconnected, led the government to halt the vaccination campaign. 
By 2016, in a situation made worse by political unrest, health service corruption and vaccine shortages, Ukraine had one of the lowest uptakes of measles vaccine in the world, with only one in three of six-year-old children protected with two doses of vaccine.  
Although over 90% of six-year-olds are now protected, the reservoir of young people left unprotected has allowed measles to take hold.
The country has become a hotspot for measles, with 54,000 cases in 2018, compared with about 5,000 in the previous year.
Immunity levels have also fallen in countries where the health system has collapsed, such as Yemen, which is in the midst of civil war, and Venezuela, which tackling a serious economic crisis. 
This can have knock-on effects on other countries too, such as in Brazil, which has experienced mass migration from Venezuela.
Some countries are moving toward mandatory vaccination and many more have tightened up existing requirements. 
Italy and France have extended existing requirements with fines and restricted school attendance. And Germany is currently discussing making measles vaccine mandatory.  
In New York's Rockland County, unvaccinated children have been banned from public places for 30 days. But it is difficult to see how this could be effectively enforced and there is little evidence that mandatory vaccination is always the best approach. 
Those determined to not vaccinate will find a way round the system, for example by home-schooling or paying a fine.  
Meanwhile, parents on the fence about vaccination may become more resistant if they feel they are not being given a choice. A better solution may be the opportunity to have a conversation with a health professional to respond to their concerns.
More like this
Meanwhile, checking vaccination status on entry to nursery and then to school would act as a useful reminder to parents and reinforce their importance.
As most under-immunisation results from difficulties accessing services, tailored immunisation services would also be helpful. 
For example, an innovative response to a measles outbreak in the London borough of Hackney was the ""spotty bus"" - a mobile immunisation unit that toured the neighbourhood, parking in school playgrounds and supermarket car parks, vaccinating almost 1,000 children whose parents simply needed easier access to immunisation services.
It is not enough for health services to expect parents to come to them.
Taking a proactive approach and offering these kinds of easily accessible vaccine programmes would help to prevent further outbreaks. 
Since the global fall in vaccination rates mainly stems from practical or logistical issues, it is often more important to have an everything in place for a successful vaccination programme. 
This means having enough vaccines to go around, via services that are well organised, easy to access and supported by government efforts to increase public trust in vaccination.

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-47828986,"Sydney Brenner, one of the giants of 20th Century science, has died.
The South African of Lithuanian descent made many pioneering discoveries in the field of molecular and developmental biology, winning a Nobel Prize in 2002.
The Nobel recognised his work with the tiny roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, which is now widely used by researchers as a model to test the fundamentals of how all living organisms work.
But Brenner also made big contributions to the understanding of DNA.
He worked routinely with the other greats in this area, such as Francis Crick, François Jacob, Linus Pauling and James Watson.
Brenner helped establish the role played by the molecule RNA in carrying the ""code of life"" held in the DNA sequence to the ribosome protein factories in cells.
He also realised the importance of codons - the sets of three bases, or ""letters"" - in the DNA sequence that signify the correct string of amino acids the ribosomes should use to assemble the proteins.
It is the proteins - enzymes and hormones, etc - that ultimately construct and maintain our bodies.
Born in 1927, Sydney Brenner had an impoverished start to life as an immigrant in South Africa, and famously taught himself to read from the newspapers that were used as tablecloths at dinner time. 
But his precocious talent saw him win a scholarship to medical school at the age of just 15.
He later went on to study for a PhD at Oxford University in the UK, before moving across to Cambridge where he joined the hothouse environment of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology.
The LMB produced a stream of Nobel Prize winners, and he was its second director from 1979 to 1986. 
In his later years, he put much effort into building scientific capacity in Singapore. 
And it was the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore's lead public sector research agency, that announced Sydney Brenner's death on Friday morning.",,,,
1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-47831576,"A migraine sufferer who started taking a regular dip in the cold sea to see if it would help ease symptoms has completed her 100 day challenge.
Beth Francis from Anglesey has seen her migraines reduce from 25 to 15 a month since her personal crusade started.
She is not sure if exercise, being outdoors or swimming has helped.
But she has vowed to continue and dozens of people joined her and her partner Andrew Clark for the 100th swim off Llanddona Beach on Sunday. 
Speaking after the swim, Beth described the response to her efforts as ""incredible"".  
""We've just been sharing what we've been doing through social media,"" she added. 
""When we started it was just a journey, and it very quickly became much more than that. 
""So we wanted to make this end day a celebration of everybody else involved as well.""
Marine biologist Beth, 27, believes swimming in the sea has helped her condition, and she also found getting in the water soon after her symptoms started helped to reduce their severity of her migraines, although she continues to take medication and to see a specialist.
In 2017, the chronic migraines became so severe that Beth, who has been a sufferer since the age of nine, had to take sick leave from her first year of a PhD in marine biology at Bangor University.
She said she became ""desperate"" with symptoms including tinnitus, nausea, stomach aches and feeling numb on one side.
Migraine is very common - it affects one in seven British people - and can be hard to stop.
So Beth started regularly taking the plunge in the sea off Anglesey after reading research that ""the sea can be used as motivation to exercise outdoors to influence health and wellbeing"".
And she and filmmaker Andrew, 29, started publishing their experiences on social media, under the name 100 Days of Vitamin Sea.
Andrew said the decision to start swimming to try and improve their wellbeing was ""easy"".
""There's a lot of anecdotal stories floating round about the benefit to health of wild swimming and cold water swimming, or people who just get a kick out of it,"" he said. 
""Living where we are, when we heard it could ease Beth's migraines or just make us a bit happier, it was an easy opportunity to take.""
Their quest for a cure for Beth also saw the pair sharing their experiences on the BBC Breakfast TV sofa. 
The project earned them an international accolade for patient-led action as well as support from other sufferers, with swimmers from around the world coming to Llanddola beach for her 100th swim.
""It seems to have touched a lot of people,"" said Beth.
""It has been an amazing journey.""
She said a university research project was being set up, looking for participants to take cold showers rather than a dip in the sea, to see if it helped with their migraines.
A spokeswoman for The Migraine Trust said she was pleased Beth had found a way to deal with her own symptoms.
""If it is working for her, then that is very positive,"" she said. 
""Migraine is an utterly miserable condition.""",,,,
1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47826946,"Internet sites could be fined or blocked if they fail to tackle ""online harms"" such as terrorist propaganda and child abuse, under government plans.
The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has proposed an independent watchdog that will write a ""code of practice"" for tech companies.
Senior managers could be held liable for breaches, with a possible levy on the industry to fund the regulator. 
But critics say the plans threaten freedom of speech.
The Online Harms White Paper is a joint proposal from the DCMS and the Home Office. A public consultation on the plans will run for 12 weeks.
The paper suggests:
Outlining the proposals, Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said: ""The era of self-regulation for online companies is over.
""Voluntary actions from industry to tackle online harms have not been applied consistently or gone far enough.""
Discussing potential penalties on BBC Breakfast, he said: ""If you look at the fines available to the Information Commissioner around the GDPR rules, that could be up to 4% of company's turnover... we think we should be looking at something comparable here.""
The plans cover a range of issues that are clearly defined in law such as spreading terrorist content, child sex abuse, so-called revenge pornography, hate crimes, harassment and the sale of illegal goods.
But it also covers harmful behaviour that has a less clear legal definition such as cyber-bullying, trolling and the spread of fake news and disinformation.
It says social networks must tackle material that advocates self-harm and suicide, which became a prominent issue after 14-year-old Molly Russell took her own life in 2017. 
After she died her family found distressing material about depression and suicide on her Instagram account. Molly's father Ian Russell holds the social media giant partly responsible for her death.
Mr Russell told the BBC that the white paper was ""a very important step"" towards making the internet a safer place.
""I think after what we've been through and sadly what so many families go through, the urgency is huge,"" he said.
However he added that the paper could have contained more specific guidance for parents.
""For example, there's not very much about age limits and ratings - it seems to me lots of companies self-rate their apps and their content and that makes it very difficult for a parent to know how much they can trust those platforms,"" he said. 
Home Secretary Sajid Javid said tech giants and social media companies had a moral duty ""to protect the young people they profit from"".
""Despite our repeated calls to action, harmful and illegal content - including child abuse and terrorism - is still too readily available online.
The plans call for an independent regulator to hold internet companies to account. 
It would be funded by the tech industry. The government has not decided whether a new body will be established, or an existing one handed new powers.
The regulator will define a ""code of best practice"" that social networks and internet companies must adhere to.
As well as Facebook, Twitter and Google, the rules would apply to messaging services such as Snapchat and cloud storage services.
The regulator will have the power to fine companies and publish notices naming and shaming those that break the rules.
The government says it is also considering fines for individual company executives and making search engines remove links to offending websites.
It is also consulting over blocking harmful websites.
On the face of it, this is a tough new regime - and ministers have acted upon the demands of charities like the NSPCC which want what they regard as the ""Wild West Web"" to be tamed. 
But a closer look reveals all sorts of issues yet to be settled. 
Will a whole new organisation be given the huge job of regulating the internet? Or will the job be handed to the media regulator Ofcom? 
What sort of sanctions will be available to the regulator? And will they apply equally to giant social networks and to small organisations such as parents' message boards?
Most tricky of all is how the regulator is going to rule on material that is not illegal but may still be considered harmful.
Take this example. Misinformation is listed as a potential harm, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock has talked about the damaging effects anti-vaccination campaigners have had. 
So will the regulator tell companies that their duty of care means they must remove such material? 
The government now plans to consult on its proposals. It may yet find that its twin aims of making the UK both the safest place in the world online and the best to start a digital business are mutually incompatible.
The white paper offers some suggestions that could be included in the code of best practice.
It suggests the spread of fake news could be tackled by forcing social networks to employ fact-checkers and promote legitimate news sources.
But the regulator will be allowed to define the code by itself.
The white paper also says social media companies should produce annual reports revealing how much harmful content has been found on their platforms.
The children's charity NSPCC has been urging new regulation since 2017 and has repeatedly called for a legal duty of care to be placed on social networks.
A spokeswoman said: ""Time's up for the social networks. They've failed to police themselves and our children have paid the price.""
Rebecca Stimson, Facebook's head of UK policy, said in a statement: ""New regulations are needed so that we have a standardised approach across platforms and private companies aren't making so many important decisions alone. 
""New rules for the internet should protect society from harm while also supporting innovation, the digital economy and freedom of speech.""
Twitter's head of UK public policy Katy Minshall said in a statement: ""We look forward to engaging in the next steps of the process, and working to strike an appropriate balance between keeping users safe and preserving the open, free nature of the internet.""
TechUK, an umbrella group representing the UK's technology industry, said the government must be ""clear about how trade-offs are balanced between harm prevention and fundamental rights"".
Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group, said the government's proposals would ""create state regulation of the speech of millions of British citizens"".
Matthew Lesh, head of research at free market think tank the Adam Smith Institute, went further.
He said: ""The government should be ashamed of themselves for leading the western world in internet censorship. 
""The proposals are a historic attack on freedom of speech and the free press.
""At a time when Britain is criticising violations of freedom of expression in states like Iran, China and Russia, we should not be undermining our freedom at home.""
And freedom of speech campaigners Article 19 warned that the government ""must not create an environment that encourages the censorship of legitimate expression"".
A spokesman said it opposed any duty of care being imposed on internet platforms.
They said that would ""inevitably require them to proactively monitor their networks and take a restrictive approach to content removal"". 
""Such actions could violate individuals' rights to freedom of expression and privacy,"" they added.

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47852578,"Using electricity to precisely stimulate the brain can boost people's working memory, a study suggests.
The team at Boston University, in the US, gave people in their sixties and seventies the working memory of someone in their twenties.
The effect lasted at least 50 minutes after the stimulation stopped.
But larger studies are now needed to see if stimulation could help people in the ""real world"" or in treating brain diseases like Alzheimer's. 
Working memory is where your mind keeps temporary information, and has been described as the ""sketch pad of the mind"".
You need your working memory to write down a phone number as someone reads it out to you. 
Problem-solving, mathematical calculations and decision-making all involve working memory too.
Robert Reinhart, an assistant professor at Boston University, and one of the researchers, says: ""It's essentially where consciousness lives.""
Working memory is different to long-term memory, which is how you recall your first day at school, wedding day, childhood pet etc.
But working memory declines naturally with age.
The study, published in Nature Neuroscience, took 42 people in their twenties, and 42 in their sixties or seventies. 
They played a glorified game of spot-the-difference between two images shown one after the other. 
The young adults were faster and more accurate without any brain stimulation. 
But the older adults' performance improved with brain stimulation.
Dr Reinhart said: ""We can bring back the more superior working memory function that you had when you were much younger. 
""This is important because the global population is rapidly ageing, and the elderly struggle with many real-world activities that critically rely on their memories.""
These included ""recognizing human faces, navigating the physical environment, remembering to take their medication and making financial decisions"", he said.
The researchers were focused on brainwaves in two regions of the brain involved in working memory - the temporal and prefrontal brain regions.
""The brain is like a conductor of an orchestra, and it's using low frequency rhythms [brainwaves] to communicate information,"" says Dr Reinhart.
But the study showed that brainwaves become out of sync - like musicians giving a disjointed performance - as we age.
The team at Boston University started by recording people's brainwaves with an electroencephalogram.
They used electricity stimulation - specifically high definition transcranial alternating current - to strengthen and resynchronise the brainwaves.
The researchers and other scientists want to see the experiments repeated with larger groups of people in order to be certain of the results. 
The other issue is whether the kind of boost reported in this study would make a meaningful difference in people's day-to-day lives.
And it is uncertain how long any benefit lasts, as the study only tested people for up to 50 minutes.
To be useful in real life would need either a long-term benefit or a way of making the technology portable.
The research was conducted only in healthy people, so it is impossible to draw conclusions about diseases like Alzheimer's.
The researchers hope that one day brain stimulation will find a role in a range of brain disorders from dementia to autism and ADHD to epilepsy. 
The Alzheimer's Society welcomed the report: ""Altering and correcting the circuitry of the brain with technology is a new exciting avenue of research for dementia.""
The technology has only been tested for restoring lost ability, but could the same approach be used for enhancement?
Dr Reinhart says: ""I think it is possible to sort of turbocharge even normal, healthy, cognitive functioning people, including young people.
""But the largest improvements appear in the people with the greatest deficit at baseline... people who are struggling the most.""
Dorothy Bishop, a professor of developmental neuropsychology from the University of Oxford, says: ""It would be premature to extrapolate the findings to everyday functioning in individuals with clinically significant memory problems. 
""There is no indication that any beneficial effects of stimulation persist beyond the experimental session. 
""Considerably more research would need to be done before concluding that this method had clinical application.""

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47830256,"The former president of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios says he has a ""blind mind's eye"".
Most people can close their eyes and conjure up images inside their head such as counting sheep or imagining the face of a loved one. 
But Ed Catmull, 74, has the condition aphantasia, in which people cannot visualise mental images at all. 
And in a surprising survey of his former employees, so do some of the world's best animators. 
Ed revolutionised 3D graphics, and the method he developed for animating curved surfaces became the industry standard.
He first realised his brain was different when trying to perform Tibetan meditation with a colleague. 
Visualisation is a core part of the practice and he was told to picture a sphere in front of him.
Ed told the BBC: ""I went home, closed my eyes… I couldn't see a thing and for an entire week I kept trying to visualise this sphere.""
He spoke to colleagues and learned that some animators could form mental images so strong they would open their eyes and the image would still be there, so they could practically trace what they could see. 
Ed just thought: ""That's interesting, it's probably what makes them an artist."" 
But eventually Ed realised he was not alone and that, perhaps counter-intuitively, some of the greatest talents in animation could not visualise either.
Oscar-winner Glen Keane, who created Ariel (The Little Mermaid), also has no visual imagery.
Ed told the BBC: ""He is truly extraordinary, he's one of the best animators in the history of hand-drawn animation.
""[And] he said that he could never visualise either.""
Ed said: ""When he first did The Little Mermaid, it's a bunch of scribbles. 
""And then it converges, after he works on it for a while, into this gorgeous piece of art. 
""And as far as he's concerned, that's the right way to work because it means he's looking deep down inside, for his emotions, and that's what drives his drawing.""
The term aphantasia was coined by Prof Adam Zeman, from the University of Exeter Medical School, in 2015.
He had documented a case of a man who lost his mind's eye in his 60s following a heart operation.
Prof Zeman was then contacted by people who reported never having one and he described the condition as aphantasia in the journal Cortex.
Around one in 50 people is thought to have aphantasia, although exactly what is going on in the brain is still unclear. 
Parts of the brain from the frontal and parietal lobes are involved in visualisation and differences at any point in the system could be the cause.
Ed, who co-founded Pixar, had a parting gift for his former employees when he left last year - a piece of homework. 
He asked 540 members of staff to take a test of the vividness of their visual imagery.
He sorted the results into: 
It showed that the artists were slightly better than technical artists at visualising, but the differences were not that huge.
""It was not a large skew, that's the real issue,"" said Ed.
The production managers were better than both.
The homework also revealed stark differences between two artists and good friends of Ed's who had worked on Frozen. 
One can see an entire movie in his head and play it backwards and forwards and never needs to see a movie twice because he can visualise it. 
The other cannot see anything at all. 
Some people with aphantasia find it a cause of distress.
People have described feeling isolated and alone after discovering that other people could see images in their heads and they could not.
Ed argues aphantasia is not a barrier to success.
He told the BBC: ""I think the main message is, 'OK folks you can't use it as an excuse, you can still do good work, regardless of your differences'.""
And believes the study clears up misperceptions about the creativity.
He added: ""People had conflated visualisation with creativity and imagination and one of the messages is, 'they're not the same thing'.
""The other one I think that people might have assumed, but if you think about it you can see why it's false assumption, is you would think if a person could visualise, they're more likely to be able to draw.
""If you open your eyes and you take out a pencil and pad, how many people can draw what they see? The answer is a very small number, so if you can't draw what is in front of you then why would we expect that you would be able to draw what you visualise?""
Discovering he has aphantasia has also led to some insight into Ed's personal life, because his wife has very strong visual imagery. 
He can remember their first date was in a park on the other side of the freeway and that is it. She can describe the whole area. 
Prof Zeman, who has led research in the field of aphantasia, said: ""I think it's really helpful for people to know that the way they visualise - or not - doesn't define them.
""Although we all have different thought processes, that doesn't link with the quality of what you produce. 
""We just all go about it in different ways.""

The emergency warning covers certain postcodes in Brooklyn. All residents in the affected areas have been told to get vaccinated or face a fine.  
There have been 285 cases in the area since 30 September. Of those infected, 246 were children, New York health commissioner Oxiris Barbot said. 
It is the largest measles outbreak in the city since 1991. 
Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can result in serious health complications, such as pneumonia and swelling of the brain. 
In a press conference, Dr Barbot said that of the 285 reported cases, 21 people have been hospitalised and five had been admitted to an intensive care unit.
No deaths have been reported. 
Under the order, any person living in the affected areas who has not been vaccinated must be immunised within 48 hours. 
Parents of children older than six months must get them vaccinated or show proof of immunisation.
Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters: ""I want everyone to understand how serious this is and how quickly it spreads. The bottom line is to recognise that this is something that has now become even more urgent.

Rose Marie Bentley, a pet feed store owner who passed away in October 2017, donated her body to research at a university in Portland, Oregon.
Students in an anatomy class were the first to notice many of her organs were not where they were supposed to be. 
Despite multiple surgeries, her condition had not been identified. 
Doctors are stunned that Mrs Bentley was able to live such a long and healthy life despite her condition.
She had situs inversus with levocardia, which means her liver, stomach and other abdominal organs were reversed right to left - the mirror image of a typical human anatomy. Her heart, however, remained in the normal position, on the left side of her body.
The condition is ""surpassingly unusual"", said Dr Cam Walker, an assistant professor of anatomy at Oregon Health and Science University, who helped students in his class unravel the mystery of Mrs Bentley's body.
Dr Walker told the BBC the discovery began while his students were dissecting the cardiovascular cavity and were unable to locate a major vessel. The finding started a ""cascade effect"" as they realised that Mrs Bentley's body was particularly unique. 
Situs inversus with levocardia is rare, occurring about once in every 22,000 births. It is normally associated with life-threatening heart issues and other abnormalities, making Mrs Bentley's long life even more exceptional. 
Dr Walker estimates that only one in 50 million people born with this condition live into adulthood. He and his colleagues believe Mrs Bentley may be the oldest person known to live with this condition. Scientists are aware of only two other cases where patients reached the age of 70. 
""None of my colleagues had ever seen a donor with situs inversus and some of them had been teaching for more than 30 years,"" Dr Walker said. ""I've never seen anything like that."" 
""The students, I think, will never forget it,"" he added. 
Mrs Bentley lived most of her adult life in Oregon, near the rural north-western town of Molalla. She owned and operated the Bentley Feed Store with her husband. 
Louise Allee, one of Mr and Mrs Bentley's five children, told the Oregon Health and Science University that her mother would love the attention her rare case is receiving.
""My mom would think this was so cool"", Ms Allee said.
Mrs Bentley's children told the university that she lived a very healthy life, without any chronic conditions except for arthritis. 
She had had three surgeries, but only the doctor who removed her appendix noted its atypical location in her body. 
Both Mr and Mrs Bentley decided to donate their bodies to the Oregon Health and Science University body donation programme, after reading a poem by Robert Noel Test about remembering departed loved ones.

The 28-year-old woman, identified only as Ms He, was pulling out weeds when the insects flew into her eyes.
Dr Hong Chi Ting of the Fooyin University Hospital told the BBC he was ""shocked"" when he pulled the 4mm insects out by their legs. 
Ms He has now been discharged and is expected to make a full recovery. 
Sweat bees, also known as Halictidae, are attracted to sweat and sometimes land on people to imbibe perspiration. They also drink tears for their high protein content, according to a study by the Kansas Entomological Society.
Ms He was weeding around her relatives' graves when the insects flew into her left eye. 
She was visiting the grave as part of the annual Chinese Qing Ming tomb-sweeping festival, which is traditionally observed by sprucing up loved ones' graves. 
When a gust of wind blew into her eyes she assumed it was dirt that had entered, she told reporters. 
But hours later, her eyes were still swollen and in pain, leading her to seek medical help at the hospital in southern Taiwan. 
""She couldn't completely close her eyes. I looked into the gap with a microscope and saw something black that looked like an insect leg,"" Dr Hong, an ophthalmology professor at the hospital told the BBC.
""I grabbed the leg and very slowly took one out, then I saw another one, and another and another. They were still intact and all alive.""
Dr Hong added that the bees could have been blown inside her eye by a gust of wind and found themselves stuck inside.
""These bees don't usually attack people but they like drinking sweat, hence their name,"" he said.
Dr Hong added that Ms He was ""lucky"" that she did not rub her eyes while the bees were inside. 
""She was wearing contact lenses so she didn't dare to rub her eyes in case she broke the lens. If she did she could have induced the bees to produce venom... she could have gone blind.""

And with the title on the post being ""My aunt framed my cousin's umbilical cord and shaped it as a heart"", the other Redditers did not fail to show their shock and fascination with the artistic effort.
In a pregnant woman, the umbilical cord joins the foetus to the placenta - the organ responsible for providing oxygen and nutrients, and removing waste substances. 
While traditionally it tends to be removed as a waste product after the birthing process, it appears as though umbilical cord art has a cult following among new mothers.
Images are available for inspiration, observation and perturbation across all major social platforms.
Indeed in 2017, The Saturdays singer and television presenter Rochelle Humes revealed she had turned her baby's umbilical cord into art.
On Reddit though, the reaction was generally a negative one with user commenting: ""Yeah I remember cleaning out some old wardrobes and we found my brother's umbilical cord. It literally crumbled like a coffee cake. It was absolutely foul.""
While AronJanet42 wrote: ""My mom has my umbilical cord, hair from my first haircut and baby teeth. She even has the tooth I knocked out while drunk at 19. Not sure if it's for a clone or for voodoo but something's coming"".
A lot of the conversation then veered around placentas and preserving those, with even some querying about whether this was cannibalism. The general consensus on that though was a no, it is not. 
Rachel Galvan decided to make a necklace out of her son Isaiah's cord and nails, and told the BBC her bespoke jewellery is ""odd but treasured"".
""I gave birth at 18 while at university and it was a very hard endeavour. It was an unexpected pregnancy, which was a shock to my family, friends, and college. 
""I did not tell a single soul except my then boyfriend - now husband - about the life growing inside me until my ninth month of pregnancy."" 
Rachel remembered her mum fainting, her dad crying, her friends gossiping and she said everything just seemed to fall apart. However, she completed her university exams and said the whole process was a learning curve.
""My boy is wonderfully made and I believe we are specially made for each other. He is a gift and the necklace is a constant reminder he has changed my life and the people surrounding me.

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47886282,"Scientists have taken cancer apart piece-by-piece to reveal its weaknesses, and come up with new ideas for treatment.
A team at the Wellcome Sanger Institute disabled every genetic instruction, one at a time, inside 30 types of cancer.
It has thrown up 600 new cancer vulnerabilities and each could be the target of a drug. 
Cancer Research UK praised the sheer scale of the study.
The study heralds the future of personalised cancer medicine. At the moment drugs like chemotherapy cause damage throughout the body. 
One of the researchers is Dr Fiona Behan, whose mother died after getting cancer for the second time. 
The first course of chemotherapy damaged her mother's heart, so she was not physically strong enough for many treatments the second time around.
Dr Behan told the BBC: ""This is so important because currently we treat cancer by treating the entire patient's body. We don't target the cancer cells specifically.
""The information we have uncovered in this study has identified key weak-spots of the cancer cells, and will allow us to develop drugs that target the cancer and leave the healthy tissue undamaged."" 
Cancer is caused by mutations inside our body's own cells that change the instructions written into our DNA. 
Mutations corrupt cells leading to them growing uncontrollably, spreading around the body and eventually killing people.
The researchers embarked on a gargantuan feat of disabling each genetic instruction - called a gene - inside cancers, to see which were crucial for survival.
They disrupted nearly 20,000 genes in more than 300 lab-grown tumours made from 30 different types of cancer. 
They used a tool called Crispr - the same genetic technology that was used to re-engineer two babies in China last year.
It is a relatively new, easy and cheap tool for manipulating DNA, and this study would have been an impossible feat just a decade ago.
The results, published in the journal Nature, revealed 6,000 crucial genes which at least one type of cancer needs to survive. 
Some were unsuitable for developing cancer drugs, as they are also essential in healthy cells. 
Others are already the target of precision drugs like Herceptin in breast cancer - the team called this a ""sanity check"" that proves their method works.
And yet more are beyond current science to develop suitable drugs, so the researchers narrowed down a shortlist of 600 potential new targets for drugs to attack.
One potential target is ""Werner syndrome RecQ helicase"" also known more simply as WRN.
The research team found it was essential for keeping some of the most genetically unstable cancers alive. 
WRN plays a vital role in around 15% of colon cancers and 28% of stomach cancers, but there are no drugs that target it. 
The work was a collaboration between Sanger, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and pharmaceutical giant GSK. All the findings are publicly available.
The eventual aim of the research is to develop a ""Cancer Dependency Map"" of every vulnerability in every type of cancer.
Then doctors would be able to test a patient's tumour and give them a cocktail of precision drugs to kill the cancerous cells. 
Dr Behan told the BBC: ""We're understanding what's going on in the cancer cells so we can shoot our machine gun at the cancer cells, not at the whole body as chemotherapy does.
""This is the first step in putting a laser sight on our machine gun.""
Prof Karen Vousden, Cancer Research UK's chief scientist, said: ""What makes this research so powerful, is the scale. 
""This work provides some excellent starting points and the next step will be a thorough analysis of the genes that have been identified as weaknesses in this study, to determine if they will one day lead to the development of new treatments for patients.""

England's health watchdog already recommends face-to-face CBT for people who have IBS, despite other treatment.
But researchers say many people are unable to access it. 
Irritable bowel syndrome is a common and often life-long condition that affects the bowels - it can cause stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation.
There's no cure, but changes to diet and medicines can help control the symptoms.
The team of scientists from the University of Southampton and King's College London, say their newly designed phone and web-based CBT requires fewer therapist hours and could be offered more widely to people who need it.   
Laura Day, 31, a freelance journalist living in London, told the BBC that taking part in the web-based therapy was ""the best thing she had ever done"". 
She remembers being ""the kid with the nervous tummy"" from the age of about five, and finding mornings particularly difficult. 
She said she would often spend a long time on the loo, opening her bowels two or three times before she left the house and everything had to revolve around her IBS.
She used to plan emergency toilet stops on her way to work and made sure she had diarrhoea tablets with her at all times. 
She told the BBC: ""I was sceptical about the therapy at first and could not understand how changing my mindset could change my bowels.
""But one of the most helpful things was understanding the strong link between how you think and  how your body reacts. 
""Now when I have nervous moments I don't dwell on them, I don't worry about it being something more sinister any more and I understand what is going on.""
The trial involved 558 people who had long-standing IBS, with symptoms despite medication and lifestyle advice. 
Both web and telephone therapy covered a number of topics, including detailed information on how the gut works, what IBS is, how to spot unhelpful behaviour and how to change and develop stable, healthy eating habits. 
At the end of 12 months, researchers found patients who had had either therapy reported fewer symptoms, more ability to manage work and relationships and less anxiety and depression than people on standard treatment alone. 
Lead researcher Dr Hazel Everitt told the BBC: ""What often happens when we have chronic conditions that impact on our ability to get on and do what we want in our lives, is that we adapt and try and live our lives despite the problem and sometimes the adaptations that we make in the long term are unhelpful. 
""An example might be that if you are concerned about your bowels you might be checking where the toilets are.
""Using CBT we can help people work through those behaviours and unhelpful thoughts.""
Alison Reid, chief executive officer of the charity the IBS Network, said she welcomed the recommendations for further care and support.
She added:  ""I think it is indisputable that current health provision is wholly failing those living with IBS who, after a diagnosis, often feel cut adrift.
""But a significant number of those we talk to take some time to acknowledge they have a role to play in their health and well-being and resist the suggestion that the way they think plays any part in their condition.
""And while the current system of care under the NHS is not giving people living with IBS the support they need, many of the charity's members who are not digital natives feel marginalised by an increasing number of services going online.""
Researchers are currently training NHS therapists in England to deliver telephone-based therapy through the Improving Access to Psychological Therapy programme. 
And they are working with commercial companies to develop the internet-based version. They have also submitted it to the NHS for consideration.",,,,

The baby boy was born weighing 2.9kg (6lbs) on Tuesday. The mother and child are said to be in good health. 
The doctors say they are ""making medical history"" which could help infertile couples around the world.
But some experts in the UK say the procedure raises ethical questions and should not have taken place. 
The experimental form of IVF uses an egg from the mother, sperm from the father, and another egg from a donor woman. 
It was developed to help families affected by deadly mitochondrial diseases which are passed down from mother to baby. 
It has been tried in only one such case - a family from Jordan - and that provoked much controversy.
But some fertility doctors believe the technology could increase the odds of IVF too.
This is all about mitochondria - they are the tiny compartments inside nearly every cell of the body that convert food into useable energy.
They are defective in mitochondrial diseases so combining the mother's DNA with a donor's mitochondria could prevent disease. 
But there is also speculation mitochondria may have a role in a successful pregnancy too. That claim has not been tested. 
The patient was a 32-year-old woman in Greece who had endured four unsuccessful cycles of IVF. 
She is now a mother, but her son has a tiny amount of his genetic makeup from the donor woman as mitochondria have their own DNA.
Dr Panagiotis Psathas, president of the Institute of Life in Athens, said: ""A woman's inalienable right to become a mother with her own genetic material became a reality. 
""We are very proud to announce an international innovation in assisted reproduction, and we are now in a position to make it possible for women with multiple IVF failures or rare mitochondrial genetic diseases to have a healthy child.""
The Greek team were working with the Spanish centre Embryotools, which has announced that 24 other women are taking part in the trial and eight embryos are ready to be implanted. 
In February 2018, the doctors in Newcastle who pioneered the technology were given permission to create the UK's first three-person babies. 
The fertility regulator approved two attempts, both in families with rare mitochondrial diseases. 
Some doctors in the UK argued the two applications - fertility and disease prevention - are morally very different. 
Tim Child, from the University of Oxford and the medical director of The Fertility Partnership, said: ""I'm concerned that there's no proven need for the patient to have her genetic material removed from her eggs and transferred into the eggs of a donor. 
""The risks of the technique aren't entirely known, though may be considered acceptable if being used to treat mitochondrial disease, but not in this situation. 
""The patient may have conceived even if a further standard IVF cycle had been used.""
Dr Beth Thompson, from the Wellcome Trust, said: ""UK regulation was based on strong public engagement and scientific evidence and allows the risks and benefits to be carefully weighed up. 
""We're proud to be supporting the first UK study into the use of mitochondria donation techniques in a well regulated environment, but we're concerned about studies taken place without similar levels of oversight.""

The British Medical Association (BMA) warns ""a culture of secrecy"" could undermine the ability of medics to plan care and deliver treatment.
Confidential NHS England files, seen by Newsnight, suggest supply chain issues mean some drugs ""cannot be stockpiled"". 
The government said it has been ""as transparent as possible"".
With political discussions continuing and EU leaders having agreed a six-month extension to Brexit, the Department for Health has been co-ordinating work across the sector, involving the NHS, pharmaceutical companies and others to prepare for a no-deal Brexit scenario. 
""Stockpiling is just one part of our multi-layered approach to minimise any supply disruption, which includes alternative transport routes,"" a spokesman said.
""We are confident that, if everyone does what they need to do, the supply of medicines should be uninterrupted in the event of a no deal.""
The BMA, which represents doctors across the UK, said it was vital for patient safety that medics were informed about which drugs were being stockpiled and which might be affected by a no-deal Brexit.
""Only if there is clarity on the availability of medicines can GPs, consultants, pharmacists, nurses and health care professionals plan and deliver effective patient care,"" said Dr Andrew Green, the BMA's GP committee clinical and prescribing lead. 
""If doctors and patients are left in the dark, healthcare professionals are left not knowing what drugs are available to be prescribed, what alternatives there may be and for how long."" 
The comments follow a Newsnight report about an internal NHS England document, which detailed concerns about several drugs which pharmaceutical companies have been unable to stockpile.
In January, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government had asked firms to stockpile a six-week supply of all drugs which do not have a short shelf life. 
This would provide continuity of care in the event of any supply problems caused by a no-deal Brexit.
However, the internal document listed several drugs which had been impossible to stockpile because of problems including ""capacity constraints"" and ""disruption in production"". 
There is no suggestion that any supply disruption has been caused directly by Brexit.
The password-protected document, marked ""official sensitive"" and ""strictly confidential"", was shared with a handful of senior doctors.
One of those who received the file was Dr David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist at University Hospitals Birmingham, who was sent the documents in March.
He decided to breach his agreement to keep the information confidential, telling Newsnight it ""should be in the public domain"".
""There's nothing that I've seen in those documents that actually justifies them being confidentially held. In fact, this problem could have been sorted out a lot more easily some months ago, if the documents had been more widely shared,"" Dr Nicholl said.
The Department of Health and Social Care suggests that sharing such information could lead to people considering local stockpiling, which could cause shortages.
It said that it and the NHS have ""consistently shared all relevant no-deal plans with clinicians and stakeholder groups"".
But other patient organisations and charities echoed the BMA's concerns over a lack of transparency about the potential shortages of some drugs, which included some medicines used to treat epilepsy.
Epilepsy Action chief executive Philip Lee said the government needed to be ""more transparent at this critical time"". 
""The added uncertainty the Brexit process brings only increases the concerns of patients, doctors and charities,"" he added.
Dr Nicola Strickland, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said the assumption was that all drugs were being stockpiled. 
""It would be very reassuring for our patients and for our doctors actually to be given a list of which drugs are being stockpiled, and whether any of them are not,"" she said.
The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, said: ""We have been involved in regular discussions with NHS England, NHS Improvement, the Department of Health and Social Care as well as our members in NHS trusts across the country and we've not yet heard any details of medicine shortages related to Brexit.""

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47907976,"The World Health Organization says the spread of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo is not yet a global health emergency. 
The Ebola outbreak is the second biggest in history - infecting 1,206 people and killing 764. It shows no sign of being contained soon.
Efforts by healthcare workers have been hampered by conflict and rebel attacks.
And experts have warned it will be ""very difficult to bring it under control"".
But Prof Robert Steffen, chairman of the WHO's emergency committee on Ebola, said declaring an emergency would not change anything on the ground.
He said: ""It does not mean we can lean back and relax.
""Funds are now needed to avoid a public health emergency of international concern.""
The World Health Organization said it had received only half the money it needed to tackle the disease.
The outbreak started in August 2018 and is still contained within two provinces in DRC - North Kivu and Ituri.
However, the WHO has warned a ""rising number of security incidents"" has been making it hard to monitor the spread of the virus, vaccinate people and contact anyone who has been in contact with an Ebola patient.
Cases have been increasing in recent weeks and the WHO says the risk of the virus spreading to neighbouring countries is ""very high"".
It says the risk of the virus spreading globally is low.
Most Ebola outbreaks are over quickly and affect small numbers of people. 
Only once before has there been an outbreak that was still expanding - and with such a high number of cases - more than eight months after it began. 
That was the epidemic in West Africa between 2013 and 2016 which killed 11,310 people.
Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome charity, said: ""The teams in DRC need all our support and resources, including finance, healthcare workers, enhanced security and infrastructure, as well as more international political support. 
""This epidemic is at a very dangerous phase in an incredibly difficult environment, and we urgently need the response to evolve to help stop Ebola spreading and save lives.""
Unlike the West Africa outbreak, a vaccine has been available which is being used to protect people at risk - including doctors and people who come into contact with an Ebola patient. 
However, there have still been 85 cases and 30 deaths among healthcare workers, which further reduces the ability to deal with the outbreak. 
There is also a trial of experimental drugs taking place in Ebola centres in the country.
A ""public health emergency of international concern"" was declared for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the Zika virus outbreak in 2016.
Dr Rebecca Katz, the director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, said the decision not to declare an emergency was disappointing.
She said: ""This is a deeply concerning event, due to the pathogen itself, the total number of cases, the increase in cases just this week, and the difficulty of co-ordinating the response due to conflict - that needs to receive the appropriate level of attention.""

DNA tests revealed that Jan Karbaat, who died two years ago, impregnated their mothers at his clinic in Bijdorp, near Rotterdam.
The results were confirmed on Friday after judges allowed their release.
One of the children, named Joey, said he could ""finally close the chapter"" now he knew Mr Karbaat was his father. 
""After a search of 11 years I can continue my life. I am glad that I finally have clarity,"" he told Dutch broadcaster NOS.
Tim Bueters, a lawyer who represented the 49 children, said he was pleased about the outcome of the case after years of uncertainty. 
""It means that there is finally clarity for the children who are matched,"" he told NOS.
Mr Karbaat was first taken to court in 2017 by a group of donor children and their parents over suspicions they were related.
One of the cases involved a donor child who physically resembled the doctor, the court heard. 
Items were seized from his home after his death in April 2017 at the age of 89.
Judges ruled in 2017 that DNA tests could be carried out but said the results must be sealed pending the outcome of further court cases, Dutch media reported. 
In February this year, Rotterdam District Court ruled that the results of the tests could be finally be revealed. 
They substantiate ""serious suspicions that Mr Karbaat used his own sperm in the clinic"", a statement on the website of legal firm Rex Advocate says.

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47803286,"There is a growing trend for intravenous ""vitamin"" drips - but what are the risks? And do they even work? 
Last month, a 51-year-old woman from Hunan, China, nearly died after blending 20 different fruits to create a homemade intravenous (IV) drip. She thought vitamins from the fresh fruit would benefit her health. 
Instead, she developed a fever and itchiness, and was taken into intensive care with multiple organ damage. After dialysis, and several rounds of antibiotics, she is now recovering. 
This is an extreme example, but she may have been inspired by the growing trend for IV in which vitamins and other substances are administered directly into the blood. 
The practice is very popular in Asia where IV drips are offered in beauty salons, often by unlicensed and unqualified practitioners. 
Those promoting vitamin IV drips claim they can boost energy, strengthen the immune system, improve skin, cure hangovers, burn fat, fight jet lag, and cure a myriad of other minor ailments. 
In the US, a bus will even come to your house to offer infusions as part of a party package, to ""cure"" hangovers. 
Treatments can be very expensive, costing anything from £120 to £3,000 in one London clinic. 
Celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, Cara Delevingne and Chrissy Teigen have taken part in the growing trend, posting images of themselves on social media hooked up to IV bags. 
""The treatments are increasingly popular, particularly as a quick fix or hangover cure - but there is no evidence of benefits and they can potentially be dangerous,"" says Marcela Fiuza, from the British Dietetic Association.
""Within a medical setting, we would never infuse anything intravenously, unless we absolutely had to,"" says Sophie Medlin, who used to work as a clinical dietitian and as a lecturer in nutrition and dietetics at King's College London. 
""There is simply no medical justification for administering nutrition intravenously in any case other than intestinal failure, because it is so high risk.""
Typically, in a medical setting, a patient who has anything injected intravenously would have a thorough medical history taken.
Infusion of vitamins potentially puts the liver and kidneys under stress, and to go ahead without screening the liver and kidney function first is prohibited by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK. 
""That kind of provision is not being taken in most of the clinics I've seen practising intravenous vitamin drips,"" says Ms Medlin.
What is in the bag of fluid varies around the world. In Taipei, customers can receive a menu to choose what kind of vitamins they want to include. 
In New Delhi, customers can pick between drips called ""Basic"" or ""Thirsty"" if for hydration, or treatments for skin called ""Woke"" or ""Lit"". 
There is even a drip named ""Magic Markle"" after the Duchess of Sussex.  In London, along with detox and beauty drips, one outlet offers mood boosts.
To boost their chances in university entrance exams, high school students in Hubei, China, were photographed hooking themselves up to intravenous vitamin drips.
The image went viral, and the school claimed that the students had volunteered to take amino acids. As the school's infirmary became too full with the demand, the students took the IVs to the classroom where they could continue to study.
Ms Medlin is shocked by this - she says that IVs should never be administered outside a carefully-controlled clinical environment. 
""Any time you put anything into your body intravenously, you're running the risk of infection from the site where it's entered your bloodstream,"" she says. 
And why risk possible infection when our gut is excellent at absorbing the vitamins and minerals we need?   
For most people, a healthy balanced diet (and in some cases an oral vitamin supplement) is sufficient to provide all vitamins you need, says Ms Fuiza. 
Using IV drips mean that ""people could be unknowingly receiving excessive amounts of nutrients which may have health implications, particularly for those having it regularly and people with background health conditions (known or unknown)"", she warns. 
Certain groups at risk of deficiencies should use supplements: 
Source: NHS Choices: Supplements, who needs them? 
Lisa Rogers, from the World Health Organization, thinks that people are being overzealous in their ingestion of extra vitamins.
""They think that it will give them a certain advantage. People only need vitamins in tiny amounts and only in the case of having a deficiency is it worth considering taking extra supplements,"" she says.
Force-feeding vitamins into the veins via a drip could even put people at risk of a potential overdose, warns Ms Medlin.
""IV drips push vitamins into our bloodstream in a force-fed way. We will probably just excrete at least 90% of what's being infused in, so actually the benefits are very minimal, if any at all, and the risks massively outweigh the benefits,"" she says.
Even if no complications arise from injecting the vitamin drips, Ms Medlin says that ultimately, ""You are just making very expensive urine. It is literally money down the toilet.""

Production of immunoglobulins was banned in the UK in the 90s over fears about the potential spread of the human version of ""Mad cow disease"".
It has since been imported, but is now in short supply and there are calls by patient groups to overturn the ban.
The UK government said it was working to address the supply issue. 
Large amounts of plasma are needed to make the treatment, which is used to treat people whose immune systems have failed.
Megan is one of only 5,000 people in the UK with a rare condition called primary immune deficiency.
She had a stem cell transplant last year, which her family hope will cure her condition, but for now her life depends on regular infusions of immunoglobulins. 
Her mother Victoria Stoneman, from Aberbargoed, Caerphilly county, said without the treatment Megan may not be able to fight infections.
""This is to strengthen her new immune system, she's like a newborn baby at the moment, she's not ready to be immunised yet.
""So the immunoglobulin treatment keeps her strong and healthy and able to fight infection.""
Megan added: ""It makes me feel better.""
Ms Stoneman said she first noticed Megan's symptoms when she was two months old.
""[She had] high temperatures that we couldn't bring down and lots of hospitalisation with severe ear infections. She often displayed symptoms of infection without infection.
""She was diagnosed when she was 18 months and was put on immunoglobulin at two and a half.""
Immunoglobulins are extracted from plasma by a process called fractionation and it takes thousands of units of plasma, donated by a large group of people, to produce a single bottle.
The process was banned in the UK in the late 1990s in the wake of the Mad cow disease - or BSE - crisis.
Scientists were concerned just one blood donor carrying the human form of the fatal disease - variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) - could theoretically infect a entire batch of immunoglobulins. 
Since then all supplies have been brought in from other countries.  
But new treatments have seen the global demand for immunoglobulins rocket. 
In Wales alone requests for immunoglobulin have increased by 35% since 2013, and there is now concern the situation is unsustainable in the long term.  
Liz Macartney, from the charity UKPIPS, which represents patients with primary immune deficiencies, said shortages were already impacting on patients.
""In the past, immunologists would try and assess which product would be better for each patient,"" she said. ""At the moment, we just have to accept whatever the NHS can buy. Potentially it could be devastating. 
""Pharmaceutical companies tell us they will continue to make sure there's enough immunoglobulin for all patients who have an immune deficiency, but in the long term we've got to make sure we can produce our own.""
Tommy Browne, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, is a spokesman for the Immune Deficiency Patient Group Wales and was diagnosed with a primary immune deficiency 11 years ago.
He was recently told his medication was going to be altered.
""It's a big thing to have it changed because they don't know how you are going to react to a new brand,"" he said. 
The UK government's Department of Health, which oversees the regulation of treatments, said they were working with NHS England and other partners to address the pressure on supply of immunoglobulin over the last 18 months.
Chloe George, from the Welsh Blood Service, which manages the supply of immunoglobulins in Wales, said work was being done across the industry to increase supplies.
""Manufacturers... are also looking at ways to innovate new technologies so they can get more grams of immunglobulin per every unit of plasma,"" she added.",,,,

The perpetrators allegedly broke people's limbs and staged road accidents in exchange for part of their insurance payout.
The scam was first uncovered when one individual died after being beaten, police say.
Eleven people were arrested over similar activity last August.
Police said the organised criminal enterprise had focused on drug addicts, alcoholics, the mentally ill, and others ""on the margins of society"" in financial need.
More than 50 people were allegedly taken to ""rooms of horror"" in apartments or warehouses.
The victims were anaesthetised with drugs and had their limbs held on blocks of stone or cement, which were hit with bags of weights or large rocks.
Fake car accidents were later staged in areas of the city not covered by CCTV cameras, and gang members would take the victims to hospital, posing as relatives.

The UN body said provisional data indicated a ""a clear trend"", with all regions of the world seeing outbreaks.
Africa had witnessed the most dramatic rise - up 700%.
The agency said actual numbers may be far greater, since only one in 10 cases globally are reported.
Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs and brain.
Ukraine, Madagascar and India have been worst affected by the disease, with tens of thousands of reported cases per million people.
Since September, at least 800 people have died from measles in Madagascar alone.
Outbreaks have also hit Brazil, Pakistan and Yemen, ""causing many deaths - mostly among young children"", while a spike in case numbers was reported for countries including the US and Thailand with high levels of vaccination coverage.
In total, some 170 countries reported 112,163 measles cases to WHO, in comparison to 28,124 cases across 163 countries during the same period in 2018.
The UN says the disease is ""entirely preventable"" with the right vaccines, but global coverage of the first immunisation stage has ""stalled"" at 85%, ""still short of the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks"".
In an opinion piece for CNN, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and UNICEF head Henrietta Fore said the world was ""in the middle of a measles crisis"" and that ""the proliferation of confusing and contradictory information"" about vaccines was partly to blame.
By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News
It is one of the most contagious viruses around. However, nothing about measles has changed. It has not mutated to become more infectious or more dangerous. Instead the answers are entirely human. 
There are two stories here - one of poverty and one of misinformation. In poorer countries fewer people are vaccinated and a larger portion of the population is left vulnerable to the virus.
This creates the environment for a large outbreak to occur - such as those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kyrgyzstan and Madagascar.
But rich countries with seemingly high vaccination rates are seeing cases spike too. This is because clusters of people are choosing not to vaccinate their children due to the spread of untrue anti-vax messages on social media.
It is worth noting these figures are provisional, the WHO says the true figures will be much higher. And that measles is far from harmless. It kills around 100,000 people, mostly children, every year. 
The pair wrote that it was ""understandable, in such a climate, how loving parents can feel lost"" but that ""ultimately, there is no 'debate' to be had about the profound benefits of vaccines"".
They added: ""More than 20 million lives have been saved through measles vaccination since the year 2000 alone.""
In response to recent measles outbreaks, calls have mounted in several countries to make immunisation mandatory.
Last month, Italy banned children under six from attending schools unless they had received vaccines for chickenpox, measles and other illnesses.

Bethan Simpson, 26, from Essex, was told her daughter Elouise had spina bifida at her 20-week scan and was advised to terminate the pregnancy.
However, she opted for pioneering ""foetal repair"" surgery, which has only been carried out on a few UK women.
Two-week-old Elouise ""shows no signs"" of the condition, her mother said.
The ""very hungry"" newborn is back at the family's Burnham-on-Crouch home, as the Daily Mail first reported. 
Mrs Simpson underwent a four-hour operation during which her womb was opened and her baby's bottom exposed, allowing surgeons to ""sew up"" a tiny gap in Elouise's lower spine.
She and husband Kieron were advised to terminate the pregnancy after the condition was diagnosed, but said the decision to opt for foetal repair was a ""no brainer"".
""I couldn't justify terminating a child I could feel kicking,"" the mental health nurse said.
The procedure at University College Hospital in London was deemed successful and Elouise was born on 1 April.
""She came out literally kicking and screaming - and peeing all over the place - so she ticked all the boxes,"" Mrs Simpson told the BBC.
The family had been warned to ""expect the worst"" but their ""incredible"" baby girl came home a week ago.
""She has slightly enlarged ventricles, which she always did have, but her kidneys, bladder and hips are all normal and she has sensation right down to her toes,"" Mrs Simpson said.
""She's living proof of what this surgery can do. It might not work for everyone but we've been incredibly lucky.""
Elouise is on antibiotics ""as a precaution"", her mum said, but ""her baseline is so good the doctor hopes the effects of spina bifida will be minimal"".
""We hope she will learn to walk and talk like a normal baby,"" she added.
Mrs Simpson's surgery was funded by a charitable trust set up by the hospital which carried out her surgery and Great Ormond Street. But NHS England has confirmed that spinal surgery for unborn babies with spina bifida will soon be routinely available.
Mrs Simpson is thought to be the fourth patient to undergo the surgery in the UK, with the procedure mostly carried out in Belgium and the United States.
Spina bifida literally means 'split spine', and occurs when the spinal column and cord are not properly formed in pregnancy (before the sixth week) - leaving nerves exposed.
It occurs in around four in 10,000 pregnancies.
The cause is unknown, however mothers are encouraged to take folic acid supplements to reduce the risk of developing spina bifida in early pregnancy. 
Babies born with the condition can become paralysed, suffer bladder and bowel problems - and it can affect brain development.
It is estimated that about 80% of mothers choose termination when spina bifida is diagnosed, although the condition varies in severity.
The delicate surgical procedure involves opening the uterus and closing the gap in the baby's back while they are still in the womb.",,,,

UK investigators looked at 165,000 patients on statins and found that for one in two, the drugs had too little effect on bad cholesterol - one of the big risk factors for heart disease. 
They are not sure why statins appear to help some more than others. 
Patients should not stop taking the drugs without seeing their doctor.
One possible explanation is patients not taking their prescribed drugs or doctors giving them at too low doses, experts suggest.
Cardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people in the UK each year.
""Bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a major contributor - it can lead to furring and blockage of blood vessels.
Cutting down on saturated fat can help lower bad cholesterol, but some people will also need medication. Millions of people in the UK are given statins for this reason. 
But statins can cause side effects and there is a debate about how many patients should be prescribed them.
The study, published in the journal Heart, included 165,411 patients who had been put on statins to cut their risk of developing heart disease by lowering their cholesterol to a healthy level. 
Half of the patients - 84,609 in total - did not see their cholesterol go down by enough - the required 40% or more reduction specified by guidelines - even after being on the daily treatment for two years. 
Experts say the study findings are somewhat limited because they cannot prove that patients who do not respond well to statins will necessarily fare worse as a consequence. Other factors - like smoking and obesity - also raise cardiovascular risk. 
But the work does provide ""real life"" data and experience to draw on.
Researcher Dr Stephen Weng, from Nottingham University, said: ""Our research has shown that in almost half of patients prescribed statins, they are very effective and offer significant protection against cardiovascular disease. 
""However, for the other half - whether it's due to your genetic make-up, having side effects, sticking to the treatment or other medications - we don't see that intended benefit.""
In the study, a higher proportion of patients with a sub-optimal response to statins were prescribed lower potency doses, compared with those with an optimal response.
He said: ""We have to develop better ways to understand differences between patients and how we can tailor more effective treatment for those millions of patients who are simply blanket-prescribed statins.""
Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, advised: ""Statins are an important and proven treatment for lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of a potentially fatal heart attack or stroke.   
""If you have been prescribed statins, you should continue to take them regularly, as prescribed. If you have any concerns you should discuss your medication with your GP. There are now other drugs available to help lower cholesterol levels, and it may be that another type of medication will be an effective addition or alternative for you.""
Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""When we prescribe medication, we have to rely on patients to make sure that they take it, both at the recommended dose and for the duration of time that we think will benefit them most.
""There is a substantial body of research showing that statins are safe and effective drugs for most people, and can reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke, when prescribed appropriately - but controversy remains around their widespread use and their potential side-effects.
""There are complex reasons why patients choose not to take their prescribed medication, and mixed messaging around statins could be one of these.""",,,,
1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47937405,"Widely held myths about sleep are damaging our health and our mood, as well as shortening our lives, say researchers. 
A team at New York University trawled the internet to find the most common claims about a good night's kip.
Then, in a study published in the journal Sleep Health, they matched the claims to the best scientific evidence. 
They hope that dispelling sleep myths will improve people's physical and mental health and well-being.
So, how many are you guilty of?
This is the myth that just won't go away. 
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously had a brief four hours a night. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made similar claims, and swapping hours in bed for extra time in the office is not uncommon in tales of business or entrepreneurial success. 
Yet the researchers said the belief that less than five hours' shut-eye was healthy, was one of the most damaging myths to health.
""We have extensive evidence to show sleeping five hours or less consistently, increases your risk greatly for adverse health consequences,"" said researcher Dr Rebecca Robbins.
These included cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes, and shorter life expectancy. 
Instead, she recommends everyone should aim for a consistent seven to eight hours of sleep a night.
Thatcher: Can people get by on four hours' sleep?
The relaxing nightcap is a myth, says the team, whether it's a glass of wine, a dram of whisky or a bottle of beer. 
""It may help you fall asleep, but it dramatically reduces the quality of your rest that night,"" said Dr Robbins.
It particularly disrupts your REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep, which is important for memory and learning.
So yes, you will have slept and may have nodded off more easily, but some of the benefits of sleep are lost.
Alcohol is also a diuretic, so you may find yourself having to deal with a full bladder in the middle of the night too. 
Have you ever thought ""I need to wind down before bed, I'm going to watch some TV""?
Well, the latest Brexit twists and turns on the BBC News at Ten might be bad for sleep.
Dr Robbins argues: ""Often if we're watching the television it's the nightly news… it's something that's going to cause you insomnia or stress right before bed when we're trying to power down and relax.""
And as for Game of Thrones, it's hard to argue the Red Wedding was relaxing. 
The other issue with TV - along with smartphones and tablets - is they produce blue light, which can delay the body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin. 
Will the light from your phone kill you?
You've spent so long trying to nod off you've managed to count all the sheep in New Zealand (that's about 28 million).
So what should you do next? The answer is not to keep trying. 
""We start to associate our bed with insomnia,"" said Dr Robbins.
""It does take the healthy sleeper about 15 minutes to fall asleep, but much longer than that… make sure to get out of bed, change the environment and do something that's mindless.""
Her tip - go fold some socks. 
Who isn't guilty of reaching for the snooze button on their phone, thinking that extra six minutes in bed is going to make all the difference?
But the research team says that when the alarm goes off, we should just get up.
Dr Robbins said: ""Realise you will be a bit groggy - all of us are - but resist the temptation to snooze.
""Your body will go back to sleep, but it will be very light, low-quality sleep.""
Instead the advice is to throw open the curtains and expose yourself to as much bright light as possible.
Snoring can be harmless, but it can also be a sign of the disorder sleep apnoea. 
This causes the walls of the throat to relax and narrow during sleep, and can briefly stop people breathing. 
People with the condition are more likely to develop high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat and have a heart attack or a stroke. 
One of the warning signs is loud snoring. 
NHS: Obstructive sleep apnoea
Dr Robbins concludes: ""Sleep is one of the most important things we can all do tonight to improve our health, our mood, our wellbeing and our longevity.""

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-47878491,"When Mandy Murray found out she needed a new kidney her husband Graham volunteered to be a donor but was told he was not a match. Instead the couple became part of a kidney swap chain, which is allowing more people to find live donors.
Mandy first needed a kidney transplant about 19 years ago.
Because her husband was not compatible, Mandy had to wait until a suitable donation became available from a deceased donor. 
She considers herself lucky to have got a phone call in the middle of the night and been rushed to hospital to receive the donor kidney.
Many people are not so fortunate. Last year, 26 people in Scotland died while waiting for a kidney transplant.
When a person needs a new kidney they first turn to family and friends to find a living donor.
Doctors says patients who have a living kidney transplant tend to live longer and feel better than those who receive kidneys from a deceased donor.  
Mandy's new kidney allowed her to function for 18 years but it has recently started to decline and she was told she would need another transplant.
Her husband Graham was tested again but was still not a match.
However, Mandy's consultant told her about the UK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme, which has been running for more than a decade.
""It is where couples like us can be paired up and help each other out,"" says Mandy.
""My brilliant husband didn't hesitate for a moment. 
""I tried desperately to talk him out of it but he was having none of it.""
The kidney sharing scheme uses an algorithm designed at Glasgow University.
It goes through everyone who has volunteered and tries to find better matches and maximise the number of possible transplants.
The computer programme is run four times a year and the transplants are then scheduled by a dedicated coordinator.
It is a logistical challenge, according to Sarah Lundie, the coordinator at Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary.
In order for even the simplest kidney swap to go ahead you need two healthy donors and two recipients who are also not suffering from any illnesses. 
If any one of them gets so much as a cold, the whole carefully arranged schedule must be cancelled.
Ms Lundie must also make sure that there are operating theatres booked at both locations and four surgeons must be available to carry out the procedures, not to mention their extensive back-up teams.
There is also a great deal of liaison going on to ensure that the organs are transported from the donors to the recipients at the same time. 
As he sat in Edinburgh waiting to donate his kidney, Graham Murray, 53, was aware that there was someone in Belfast, who must remain anonymous, waiting to give up a kidney so that it could be donated to Mandy.
Graham says: ""Getting to this morning with everyone fit and healthy and ready to go is a great relief.""
His wife Mandy, 57, says they have felt the ""responsibility"" of keeping well in the weeks before the operations so that the donor sharing chain would not be broken.
She says: ""Graham and I decided to sequester ourselves in our house, get our shopping delivered and really try not to catch anything so we could make sure that bond could be maintained."" 
Graham and his counterpart in Belfast are the first part of the surgical equation.
Both donor kidneys are removed simultaneously in the two locations.
In Edinburgh, consultant transplant surgeon John Terrace scrubs up for an operation he says usually takes about three hours.
""I'm thinking about the donor rather than the recipient,"" he says. 
""The focus with donors is operating safely and meticulously. The risk to donors is actually very small.""
Mr Terrace says he uses a modified form of keyhole surgery to remove the kidney.
He uses laparoscopy to see but also has his hand inside the patient. 
""That offers an extra element of control and safety,"" Mr Terrace says. 
""The first 80% is moving things out of the way, moving the liver and the bowel and identifying the kidney and the structures that go into it and come out - the vein, the artery and ureter.""
He says these are then prepared so the kidney can be removed quickly but still be suitable for ""reimplantation"" into the recipient. 
Once the kidney is removed it is quickly on its way.
In this case, the organs leave Edinburgh and Belfast on chartered flights, arriving in time for the donation surgery to happen in the afternoon.
Mandy's kidney surgery is performed by consultant Sorina Cornateanu.
She uses blood vessels going to the leg to help attach the new kidney.
Then the blood supply is returned and the kidney turns pink and perfused.
Often the kidney passes urine on the operating table.
The surgery takes about three hours and the patient is immediately started on anti-rejection drugs and goes into a high-dependency unit.
After successfully operating on Mandy, Ms Cornateanu describes her team as the ""vehicles"" between the donor and the recipient.
""That's our role. It is fulfilling, rewarding, humbling and it is a big relief at this stage.""
Ms Cornateanu said the shared donor scheme had been a big success and even in the past year the number of live donor transplants had risen in Edinburgh by half to 14.
""It has been a big team effort from all of us and we need to sustain that. That's the challenge.""
Across Scotland, 50 kidney sharing scheme transplants have taken place in the past five years.
It is more common for living donor transplants to involve a relative or friend who is a close match but this is not always possible.
Another form of living donation is ""altruistic"". Over the past 10 years, 78 people in Scotland have donated a kidney to a stranger.
The day after their operations, Mandy and Graham were told the other donor and recipient in the chain were doing well.
Graham said: ""That's fantastic. We never expected to know.""
""I'm so pleased,"" said Mandy.
The pair hope they will soon be recovered enough to fulfil all the plans they have had to put on hold until now.",,,,

But for people living with medical conditions these things can be more than a headache.
Amber Davies, 21, has a stoma after having her bowel removed after developing ulcerative colitis.
She loves living with her friends but worries about bin collections as there are strict rules in place.
With services varying across Wales and some councils fining residents who throw too much away, there are calls for greater support to make life easier for those with medical conditions living away from home.
""We only get one black bin every two weeks, and I am responsible for filling up most of that,"" said product design student Amber, who changes her ostomy bag daily, but gets no extra allowance from Cardiff council despite living with three other people.
""To a shared house, one bin is not a lot at all, I know when I am back at home the council are a lot more lenient with what you are allowed, but here if the bin is open or over spilling then they won't take any of it, that then leads to problems.""
A stoma is an opening in the stomach where faeces are collected in a bag after part or all of the bowel is removed due to a disease or obstruction.
Many people with ileostomies, where the large colon has been removed, have bags which can be emptied but need to be changed.
But while the number of stoma bags prescribed in Wales almost trebled in the last 18 years, how the used bags are collected differs depending on where you live.
Currently, six councils in Wales collect the bags in special absorbent hygiene collections, while the rest tell people to put the used appliances in household bins, collected about every two weeks.
It is not collected by the NHS as it is not classed as ""clinical waste"", such as needles and infectious waste.
And rules differ for large households, with some areas allowing large families or people living in house shares to put out extra rubbish, while others have strict limits and can fine those who put out extra bags.
In Cardiff the council allows extra rubbish for people living in houses with six or more people, if they can prove they recycle properly. 
Amber, from Builth Wells, Powys, was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis - one of the main forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) - when she was 13.
After years of trying medications and being in and out of hospital, when she was 17 she had emergency surgery to remove part of her diseased large bowel, leaving her with a stoma.
Not long after her second operation - which removed the rest of her colon leaving her with a permanent bag - she moved away from home for the first time to go to Cardiff Metropolitan University.
Amber moved into a house with eight other students.
""It was quite daunting to start, but I am quite open and honest with people about my disease and my bag, so I made sure everyone I lived with was in the know,"" she said.
Now in her second year, she lives in a house share with three of the girls who know everything about her illness.
Loving life since her surgery, she has jumped out of a plane, is training for a half marathon, and even does swimwear shoots and is a role model on Instagram for others who need or have an ostomy to break down barriers.
But she still worries about filling up the bin with her used bags, which she changes every day, or has to change if they leak, as they only get one bin collection every two weeks
Amber said it would be really hard if she was not so open about her condition.
""For some people it could pose really big problems, but I have always been honest from day dot with the people I live with, which has made it easier,"" she said.
Wayne Lewis, project manager for Crohn's and Colitis UK in Wales, said the challenges of living with a stoma were different for each person and that more support was needed to help people.
""If you are a student and you are moving away, you are getting to know who you are, you are trying to make new friends, and you don't want to stand out from the crowd,"" he said.
""If you've got a stoma and you've got to dispose of the waste, that's a difficult thing at that age to come to terms with sometimes.""
The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), which represents local councils, said while arrangements varied across Wales people with medical conditions could contact their council to discuss individual needs. 
""Many councils have relaxations or exemptions available to cater for residents with specific medical needs,"" a spokesman said.
A Cardiff council spokesman said if anybody living in a shared house was struggling with full bins, they could request a larger one.
""We will then come out to do an assessment to come up with a solution,"" a spokesman added.",,,,
1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47947965,"Even small amounts of red and processed meat - such as a rasher of bacon a day - can increase the risk of bowel cancer, according to research.  
The latest study led by Oxford University and funded by Cancer Research UK, adds to evidence, including from the World Health Organization, that eating red meat can be harmful. 
But exactly how big is the risk? And how much is too much? 
Here's what you need to know. 
Researchers analysed data from almost half a million people involved in the UK Biobank study. 
Over the six years of their study they found 2,609 people developed bowel cancer. 
They estimate:
According to the NHS, 76g of cooked red meat is equivalent to about half an 8oz sirloin steak. A slice of ham or rasher of bacon is about 23g of processed meat. 
It's not clear. Cancer Research UK (CRUK) says 5,400 of the 41,804 cases of bowel cancer seen each year in the UK could be prevented if people did not eat processed meat at all. 
According to Emma Shields, information manager at CRUK,  ""This study shows the more meat you eat, the higher your risk of getting cancer and obviously the reverse is true - the less you eat the less likely you are to get bowel cancer,"" 
But she acknowledges smoking poses a much bigger risk, causing 54,300 cases of cancer each year. 
Public Health England says from its surveys many people eat too much red and processed meat. 
And experts advise people who eat lots of it to find ways to cut down. 
The Department of Health advises anyone eating more than 90g a day of red and processed meat should cut down to 70g. 
NHS guidance says there are some benefits of red meat - iron and protein content, for example - that must be balanced against potential risks. 
People can still eat meat and be healthy.
Processed meat - including bacon, some sausages, hot dogs, salami - is modified to either extend its shelf-life or change the taste - the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives.
It is thought the chemicals involved in the processing could be increasing the risk of cancer. High temperature cooking, such as on a barbecue, can also create carcinogenic chemicals.
When it comes to red meat like beef, lamb and pork, there are suggestions that one of the proteins (that gives it its red colour) can damage the gut when it is broken down. 
But experts are still trying to fully understand the link. 
Prof Gunter Kuhnle, at the University of Reading, described the study as a very thorough analysis of the link between meat intake and bowel (also known as colorectal) cancer.
He said: ""The results confirm previous findings that both, red and processed meat consumption, increase the risk of colorectal cancer. 
""The increase in risk of approximately 20% per 50g increase of red and processed meat intake is in line with what has been reported previously, and confirms these findings. 
""The study also shows that dietary fibre reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. An increased consumption of fibre, as shown by this study, would be of considerably more benefit.""
Carrie Ruxton, of the Meat Advisory Panel, an industry-funded body, said: ""Red meat provides valuable nutrients, such as protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D and B vitamins.""
She said it was known that ""a range of lifestyle factors have a significant impact on the risk of bowel cancer, most notably age, genetics, lack of dietary fibre, inactivity and high alcohol consumption"". 
The study is published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.",,,,
1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-47954400,"Because of rare illness, Louise Moorhouse is on a special diet of pills or foul-tasting shakes. There's a drug that would allow her to eat like anyone else - she took it for three years during a clinical trial. But the NHS won't pay for it, reports the BBC's Deborah Cohen - and the drug company stopped giving it to her once the trial was over.
Imagine having to take more than 80 pills a day or drink shakes to replace everyday foods you can't eat. That's the reality for Louise Moorhouse, a 35-year-old teacher from Birmingham, who has a rare genetic condition called phenylketonuria or PKU.
The pills are ""huge"", she says.
""They're quite tricky to swallow. I think the most I have managed to do in one go is four. Any more than that and they come out my nose.""
The shakes are preferable, but attempts to give them a fruity taste have not succeeded in masking their ""stomach-turning"" acidity. From time to time her stomach starts to reject them, Louise says. In which case, she goes back on the pills.
People with PKU can't properly digest the amino acid phenylalanine. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and are broken down by the body to make our own proteins. But in people with PKU the levels build up, and can cause brain damage.
Louise says she has to completely avoid 80% of normal food, and the protein in her diet has to be severely restricted - which may mean weighing it on scales before eating it.
""I basically live on fruits and vegetables,"" she says.
Dinner dates are best avoided, she has learned.
""I avoid socialising with food if there's people there who I don't know,"" Louise says. ""They may notice that sometimes I have to get my scales out and sometimes I have to send food back or it takes me a long time to choose food.""
But for three years, in her early 20s, Louise was able to eat like anyone else.
That's because she took part in trials for a drug now called Kuvan (sapropterin hydrochloride) that was being developed by US biotech company, BioMarin.
Watch Deborah Cohen's report on Louise Moorhouse for Newsnight
""I took part in the trial because I just thought, 'Wow, if this works it's just going to change lives,'"" she says.
And for Louise it did. 
""Kuvan allowed me to eat a completely normal diet. And it was it was almost like someone had opened curtains on my life and I could see everything in Technicolor,"" she says. ""It just freed me up so much.""
The dietician who had treated Louise as a child, Prof Anita MacDonald of Birmingham Children's Hospital, was one of the scientists involved. With help from her and Louise, BioMarin gathered enough evidence to show Kuvan reduced the levels of phenylalanine in many people with PKU. In 2007, it became the only licensed drug for the condition in the US; its European licence followed in 2008.
""Because the trial had gone so well and because it made such a difference, I was convinced that it would only be a matter of time before this drug - that we had proved worked - would be available to everyone who responded to it,"" Louise says.
But for NHS patients it wasn't. BioMarin put a £70,000 price tag on it, per adult per year - and the NHS thought it wasn't worth that. 
""The drug was too expensive and the NHS decided that there wasn't enough evidence of efficacy of that drug at that time and so they said no to prescribing it,"" says Anita MacDonald. 
It was a blow for Louise, who had to return to the pills and shakes. 
""It was a massive shock to my system,"" she says. ""I had to relearn almost everything. It had a massive effect on my concentration, my mood, my focus at work, my relationship.""
The hope of an effective treatment for PKU had appeared on the horizon in the 1990s. A simple compound developed in a Swiss laboratory had been found to enable people with PKU to digest phenylalanine. It was then researched with public money and used unlicensed by many doctors.
The trouble was, PKU is quite a rare disease. In England it is estimated that between one in 10,000 and one in 14,000 people have PKU. So there was little financial incentive for a pharmaceutical company to turn the compound into a licensed drug.
Then in 2000, the European Commission introduced incentives to encourage the production of ""orphan drugs"" for people with rare conditions, ruling that companies would enjoy up to 12 years of market exclusivity.
According to Dyfrig Hughes, professor of pharmacoeconomics at Bangor University, more than 165 orphan drugs have now been approved - and that in fact 50% of all drugs approved last year were for rare diseases. Companies find them profitable. 
But critics say the profitability - and the high price - of orphan drugs does not reflect the amount of effort companies have had to make to generate them. 
""We did one piece of work where we identified that 40% of orphan drugs are actually repurposed. That is they've been previously used for other purposes before they were granted orphan status,"" Dyfrig Hughes says. 
With governments across Europe struggling with the price of drugs used to treat rare conditions, the BBC is aware that the European Commission is reviewing the incentives scheme. 
In 2004, BioMarin - which specialises in drugs for rare conditions - bought the data from the early development of the compound to treat PKU. This meant that while it had to fund trials it didn't have to meet the costs of searching for an entirely novel chemical compound. 
When Kuvan was licensed a few years later and the NHS refused to pay the hefty price, patients were stuck in the middle. This remains the case, even now that the NHS has come to recognise the efficacy of the drug.
""BioMarin have been asked to drop the price on many occasions but at the moment they have a patent,"" Anita Macdonald says. ""They've got no competition.""
BioMarin told the BBC the NHS has asked for an 80% discount. 
""BioMarin is disappointed that the NHS England has not recognised the value of treating PKU patients with Kuvan, despite more than a decade of positive patient outcomes across 26 countries in Europe, Russia and Turkey,"" a spokesperson said. 
An NHS England spokesperson said: ""The NHS does not offer a blank cheque to pharmaceutical companies, instead the NHS works hard to strike deals which give people access to the most clinically effective and innovative medicines, and at a price which is fair and affordable, which is exactly what our patients and the country's taxpayers would expect us to do.""
Most disappointed by the outcome were the people like Louise, who had taken part in the trial and identified Kuvan as what Louise calls ""the holy grail for us"". The BBC is aware of seven others.
""You want your patients to gain any benefit from the work that they've done. They've entered the trial in good heart. We as scientists enter the trial in good heart,"" says Anita Macdonald.
""I don't think it is ethical for patients to be involved in a trial and not continue with a treatment. Those patients put a lot of trust in the drug company and it's the least that could have been done for them to continue with that treatment longer term."" 
Indeed, there is a global medical ethics agreement for research, called the Declaration of Helsinki, which says provisions should be made ""for all participants who still need an intervention identified as beneficial in the trial"". 
When the BBC pointed this out to BioMarin, the company said: ""To the best of our knowledge, BioMarin is treating all known ex-trial patients. If there are any ex-trial patients who are not being treated and would like to be treated, they should talk to their treating physician and apply for treatment.""  
For Louise, who for 10 years since the end of the trial has had to maintain her diet of pills or shakes, this came as startling news. She burst into tears. 
It had taken her years to conceive because of the difficulty getting her blood levels of phenylalanine down, she said.
""A lot has happened that didn't have to happen. All these years I could have been on Kuvan and I wouldn't have had so many issues.
""I feel so emotional - it's like winning the lottery.""
Update 1 November 2019:Louise Moorhouse has now been receiving Kuvan for several months.
British teenager Shauna Davison was given an experimental transplant in 2012, in the hope of prolonging her life. Her mother says she was told in advance about two patients who had survived a similar operation - but not about others who had died.

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47960874,"US scientists have partially revived pig brains four hours after the animals were slaughtered. 
The findings could fuel debate about the barrier between life and death, and provide a new way of researching diseases like Alzheimer's.
The study showed the death of brain cells could be halted and that some connections in the brain were restored. 
However, there were no signals from the brain that would indicate awareness or consciousness. 
The surprise findings challenge the idea that the brain goes into irreversible decline within minutes of the blood supply being cut off. 
Thirty-two pig brains were collected from an abattoir. 
Four hours later the organs were connected to a system made by the team at Yale University. 
It rhythmically pumped (to mimic the pulse) a specially designed liquid round the brain, which contained a synthetic blood to carry oxygen and drugs to slow or reverse the death of brain cells.  
The pig brains were given the restorative cocktail for six hours. 
The study, published in the journal Nature, showed a reduction in brain cell death, the restoration of blood vessels and some brain activity. 
The researchers found working synapses - the connections between brain cells that allow them to communicate.
The brains also showed a normal response to medication and used up the same amount of oxygen as a normal brain. 
This was all 10 hours after the pigs were decapitated.
Crucially there was no sign of the brain-wide electrical activity in an electroencephalogram (EEG brain scan) that would signal awareness or perception. 
Fundamentally they were still dead brains. 
The research transforms ideas about how the brain dies, which many thought happened quickly and irreversibly without a supply of oxygen.
Prof Nenad Sestan, a professor of neuroscience at Yale University, said: ""Cell death in the brain occurs across a longer time window that we previously thought.
""What we are showing is the process of cell death is a gradual, stepwise process.
""And that some of those processes can be either postponed, preserved or even reversed.""
The pig brains came from the pork industry; the animals were not raised in a lab for this experiment. 
But the Yale scientists were so concerned the pigs might become conscious that they gave drugs to the disembodied brains to reduce any brain activity.
And the team were constantly monitoring the brains to see if there was any sign of higher brain functions.
In that case they would have used anaesthetic and ended the experiment. 
Ethicists, writing in Nature, say new guidelines are needed for this field because animals used for research could end up in a ""grey area - not alive, but not completely dead"".
The immediate benefit of this work will be for scientists studying the brain in diseases like Alzheimer's. 
The organ is the most complex structure in the known universe, but techniques such as freezing slices of the brain or growing colonies of brain cells in a dish do not let researchers explore the full 3D wiring of the brain. 
In the long term, scientists hope to find better ways of protecting the brain after traumas such as a stroke or being starved of oxygen at birth.  
Dr Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, from the Brain Initiative at the US National Institute of Mental Health, said: ""This line of research could lead to a whole new way of studying the post-mortem brain.
""It also could stimulate research to develop interventions that promote brain recovery after loss of brain blood flow.""
However, the researchers say it is still far too early for the field to make a difference to patients after injury.
Prof Sestan said: ""We don't yet have knowledge whether we would be able to restore normal brain function.""
At the moment no, but some ethicists say we should have the debate now as people who are ""brain dead"" are a major source of organs for transplant.
Prof Dominic Wilkinson, a professor of medical ethics and a consultant neonatologist in Oxford, said: ""Once someone has been diagnosed as 'brain dead' there is currently no way for that person to ever recover.  
""The human person that they were has gone forever.
""If, in the future, it were possible to restore the function of the brain after death, to bring back someone's mind and personality, that would, of course, have important implications for our definitions of death.""
But that is not currently the case. 
Prof Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""This study is a long way from preserving human brain function after death as portrayed in the cartoon Futurama where heads were kept alive in a jar.  
""It is instead a temporary preservation of some of the more basic cell functions in the pig brain, not the preservation of thought and personality.""
In this experiment the answer is a clear no. The brains were effectively silent.

Breech births can be hazardous and tricky to diagnose.
Currently, midwives and doctors tend to rely on the shape and feel of the mother's bump to check. 
Researchers estimate the scans would avoid 4,000 emergency caesareans and eight baby deaths a year in England. 
If the scans could be done cheaply enough then it should also save the NHS money in terms of care, says the University of Cambridge team in the journal PLoS Medicine. 
About three to four babies in every 100 are in a breech position near the end of pregnancy. 
More babies start out breech but will turn to the ideal ""head-first"" position by about 36 weeks' gestation.
The researchers offered breech scans to 3,879 pregnant women:
Making the diagnosis at 36 weeks meant the women could be offered an attempt at manually encouraging the baby to turn in the womb to the head-first position before labour - a manipulation method called external cephalic version. 
For the women who declined, or where it did not work, a planned caesarean section was arranged. None of the women opted to attempt a vaginal breech birth, which is possible but carries some risk. 
Nineteen of the 179 women were able to deliver vaginally, 110 had a planned caesarean and 50 needed an emergency caesarean. 
Researcher Prof Gordon Smith said it should be feasible to provide the service at a low cost, for example by making it a part of a standard midwife appointment and using inexpensive portable ultrasound machines. 
""If it was under £20 per patient then it would be cost-effective and if it could be done for under £13 then it should save the NHS money in the long run,"" he said.
Experts said the cost-effectiveness for the NHS should be explored.
Private patients can pay from £30 to £200 or more for a pregnancy ultrasound scan. 
Prof Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King's College London, said the scans should be rolled out. 
""Breech can be difficult to manage in labour if previously unsuspected, as labour can be quick,"" he said.
""Breech deliveries have some risk, and counselling and decision-making in labour can be challenging. Scans are routinely available now, and minimal skills are required to determine breech presentation. This should be implemented.""
But Prof Jean Golding, emeritus professor of paediatric and perinatal epidemiology at the University of Bristol, disagrees. She said bigger, randomised trials were needed first. 
Prof Basky Thilaganathan, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said more research was needed, but added: ""So far, the evidence for its use looks very promising.""",,,,

Lesley Roberts was stunned as she read the devastating final email from her beloved son Alex Hardy.
The email had been timed to arrive on 25 November 2017, 12 hours after he killed himself. Less than an hour before the email arrived, Lesley had opened her front door to find a police officer standing there, explaining her son was dead. 
Alex was an intelligent and popular 23-year-old with no history of mental illness. Lesley could not understand why he would have wanted to take his own life.
His email explained how the foreskin of his penis had been surgically removed two years before. This is commonly known as circumcision, but Alex had come to believe it should be regarded as ""male genital mutilation"".
He never mentioned this to his family or friends when he was alive. Lesley did not even know her son had been circumcised.
In the following months, she tried to find out more about circumcision. Why had it affected Alex so badly, and why did he feel killing himself was his only option?
Alex was the eldest of Lesley's three sons and had been very much longed for, having been conceived after fertility treatment.
Lesley says her ""dreams came true"" when she became a mother in July 1994.
""He was everything I could have wished for,"" she says. ""Gorgeous, easygoing, and adoring of his younger brother Thomas who arrived following more treatment almost three years later.""
He also adored his baby brother James, who was born when Alex was 13. The walls and windowsills of Lesley's home in Cheshire are covered in photos of all of them.
Alex sailed through his education and was particularly gifted at English, so much so that his old school established the Alex Hardy Creative Writing Award in his memory.
""Alex was passionate about history but as his English teacher I saw in him a true talent for writing,"" says Jason Lowe, who is now head teacher at Tarporley High School.
It was while on a school skiing trip to Canada, aged 14, that Alex fell in love with the country. He had enjoyed skiing as a child and the trip reignited his passion. So, when Alex reached 18, he decided to defer university and live in Canada for a year.
""He fell in love completely with Canada and made so many friends and got a promotion at work,"" says Lesley.
""After one year he rang me and said 'Mum, I'm deferring my place for university'. The same thing happened after year two.""
Two years turned into three, then four, and by the time of his death Alex had been living in Canada for five years and had obtained residency.
""He was known as the 'super-smart Brit' with impeccable manners,"" says his mother. ""The super-intelligent guy from the UK who helped people with their Canadian residency applications.""
Lesley visited her son several times, both alone and with his brothers and stepfather. They were a close family, but Alex did not tell any of them he was secretly suffering with a problem with his penis.
""I had issues with a tight foreskin,"" he eventually wrote in his final email, ""but from my late teens it created issues in the bedroom as it meant my foreskin would not retract over the glans as intended which caused some awkward moments.""
In 2015, still silently suffering, Alex consulted a doctor in Canada. He was given steroid cream to stretch his foreskin, but went back to the doctor after just a few weeks because he did not think the treatment was working.
The medical name for Alex's problem is phimosis. It simply means his foreskin was too tight to pull back from the head of his penis, or the ""glans"" as Alex referred to it in his email. This is perfectly normal for boys in the early years of their life. As boys get older, their foreskin usually starts to separate from the head of the penis.
Phimosis does not always cause problems, but if it does, problems can include difficulty urinating and pain during sex. In England, the NHS advises topical steroids and stretching techniques - and circumcision as a last resort.
Over in Canada, where circumcision is more common, Alex was referred to a urologist.
""He immediately suggested circumcision,"" Alex wrote. ""I asked about stretching and he completely lied to my face and said it would not work for me.
""I was mostly trusting as I felt he was the expert who knew best in this regard so with a pinch of salt I accepted it.""
Lesley has since read online reviews of this urologist which have made her question his competence. One patient said she had been unable to work since having surgery for kidney problems, and he had ""destroyed"" her quality of life.
""I'm a mother of three young children who are scared every day I will die as they see me suffering in so much pain,"" she wrote.
""I can see how he misdiagnosed others, botched surgeries, and ruined lives,"" said another review. ""He's dangerously incompetent.""
Another review of Alex's urologist read: ""They left a surgical instrument in my bladder but I only got notified three months later. Run away before you get hurt!""
Lesley, who was ""horrified"" by these reviews, has asked for the urologist to be investigated. She has been told an inquiry is ongoing.
The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia told the BBC it ""cannot disclose the existence of a complaint against a physician, and only may do so if the complaint leads to formal discipline"".
""I will wish with my last breath and with all of heart that my darling son had run away,"" says Lesley.
Much to his regret, Alex was not able to research the urologist - or circumcision - properly at the time because his laptop was broken.
He had tried researching the topic in a public computer space but felt uncomfortable, and also felt it was ""too much of a taboo"" to discuss with friends.
So Alex booked what he believed was a minor procedure and had the surgery in 2015, at the age of 21.
In the email to his mother, Alex explained, in great detail, the physical problems he had suffered afterwards.
He described experiencing constant stimulation from the head of his penis, which was no longer protected by his foreskin.
""These ever-present stimulated sensations from clothing friction are torture within themselves; they have not subsided/normalised from years of exposure,"" he wrote.
""Imagine what would happen to an eyeball if the eyelid was amputated?""
""He was in so much pain that it hurt to do normal physical activity,"" says Lesley. ""He was a keen skier and snowboarder so you can imagine the pain he was in.""
Consultant urological surgeon Trevor Dorkin, who is a member of the British Association of Urological Surgeons, advises his patients that the head of their penis will be more sensitive after circumcision.
However, this sensitivity usually reduces.
""I always say to guys 'it's going to feel more sensitive to start with' because all of a sudden you haven't got this protection over the head of the penis and it will feel different,"" says Mr Dorkin, who has carried out more than 1,000 circumcisions.
""But in the vast majority of the cases the man adjusts to that, the brain adjusts to that, it adjusts to the signals that are coming back through the nerves from the head of the penis.""
Alex also wrote about experiencing erectile dysfunction, and burning and itching sensations, particularly from a scar which sat where his frenulum was removed. The frenulum is a band of tissue where the foreskin attaches to the under surface of the penis. Some men refer to it as their ""banjo string"".
""It's one of the more erogenous zones so it's thought to be important in sexual function,"" says Mr Dorkin.
""The foreskin, the head of the penis and the frenulum is a very, very sensitive area.
""But again when you do circumcision sometimes the frenulum is not preserved and it doesn't necessarily have an effect on overall sexual function and enjoyment.""
But Alex felt his frenulum had been important.
""Through its absence I can certainly verify it is the most erogenously sensitive area of the penis and male body overall,"" he wrote.
""If someone were to amputate your clitoris you may begin to be able to understand how this feels.""
He wrote about experiencing cramps and contractions in his muscles and ""uncomfortable"" sensations which extended deep into his abdomen.
Lesley does not know whether or not Alex had sex after his circumcision.
""Where I once had a sexual organ I have now been left with a numb, botched stick,"" he wrote. ""My sexuality has been left in tatters.""
He asked: ""Nature knows best - how can chopping off a section of healthy tissue improve nature's evolved design?""
Like many people, Lesley admits she knew very little about the foreskin or circumcision before her son died.
""I didn't know anything apart from I believed it was a very routine surgery,"" she says.
The foreskin is sometimes dismissed as a ""useless flap of skin"", but Mr Dorkin says it does have a purpose.
""It covers the head of the penis,"" he says. ""In terms of what's it for, it provides a bit of protection to the head of the penis. It's thought to have some sort of immunological function perhaps.""
Circumcision rates vary a lot depending on where you are in the world and which culture you grew up in.
According to the World Health Organization, 95% of men are circumcised in Nigeria but only 8.5% of men in the UK are.
Most of the men circumcised in the UK are either Muslim or Jewish, as circumcision is regarded as an important part of their religions.
According to the 2011 census, Muslims accounted for 4.8% of the population in England and Wales, while 0.5% were Jewish.
People who question circumcision are sometimes accused of being anti-Semitic or Islamophobic, but Lesley stresses her son was neither.
""For me, this has nothing to do with religion at all. I respect all people of faith or indeed no faith, as Alex did,"" she says.
In Canada, where Alex had moved to, an estimated 32% of men are circumcised.
Alex felt male circumcision has been normalised to the extent that most people do not question it, while female circumcision has become known as female genital mutilation (FGM) and is now illegal in many countries.
He felt male circumcision should be known as ""male genital mutilation"" - a view shared by a growing anti-circumcision movement.
""If I were a female (in Western nations) this would have been illegal, the surgeon would be a criminal and this would never have been considered as an option by doctors,"" Alex wrote.
""I do not believe in championing one gender over another but I feel strongly that gender equality should be achieved for all.""
Campaigners for ""genital autonomy"" believe it is wrong to circumcise a baby or child - whether they are male or female - because the patient cannot give consent, and these campaigners regard circumcision as a human rights issue.
Having lived with an intact penis for 21 years, Alex believed men circumcised as babies or young children would ""tragically never be able to fully comprehend what has been taken away"". He estimated he had been stripped of 75% of the sensitivity of his penis.
However, experiences of men circumcised as adults differ dramatically.
Some men actually prefer sex afterwards because they no longer have the pain of a tight or inflamed foreskin. 
Some report a significant loss in sensitivity and greatly reduced sexual pleasure. 
Some report being less sensitive but say there is no change in their overall enjoyment of sex.
Some are very happy with their decision to get circumcised.
Some, like Alex, deeply regret having it done.
Alex sought further medical help following the circumcision as well as psychological help, but never shared his problems with his family or friends.
""I was with him during those two years and I think I would be lying if I said I didn't think something wasn't right,"" says Lesley.
""I did say 'Is something bothering you? Are you OK?' and he would absolutely reassure me that he was.""
Lesley, who used to be a teacher, now hopes to go into schools and speak to young men about sharing their problems, even if they are very personal.
""I think we all know that men don't particularly tend to talk about their problems in the same way that girls do but I think circumcision is very much a taboo subject,"" she says.
""Alex was reserved. He certainly wouldn't have said 'I've got a tight foreskin and it really hurts'. And he didn't. And I didn't know.""
Only a week after Alex died, a friend opened up to Lesley about his own circumcision.
""He told me he wouldn't normally have mentioned it but he had a circumcision as an older man, 10 years ago, and he was in constant daily pain,"" says Lesley. ""It just seems it's more common than you think.""
Mr Dorkin says serious problems following a circumcision are rare, but not unheard of.
""You do hear of horror stories where a circumcision has been done poorly and there's damage done to the head of the penis itself,"" he says.
Sometimes too much skin is taken and this can result in what's known as ""burying"" or shortening of the penis, where it gets pulled back into the body.
""Surgeons at the end of the day are human and there is potential for human error and technical error during any operation,"" he says.
""One of my mentors told me every case is a tricky case, that's got to be your approach to surgery. You never take anything for granted in surgery.""
There have been cases of children and men dying after being circumcised.
Four-week-old Goodluck Caubergs bled to death after a nurse circumcised him at his home in Manchester, while one-month-old Angelo Ofori-Mintah bled to death after being circumcised.
Since 1995 at least 1,100 boys have died in South Africa after ritual circumcisions. Some penises fall off after becoming infected and rotten, while some have to be amputated.
In Canada, where Alex was living, newborn baby Ryan Heydari bled to death after being circumcised by a doctor in Ontario.
Recently there have been reports of two babies dying within weeks of each other after home circumcisions in Italy, and a two-year-old boy died after being circumcised at a migrant centre in Italy. 
""I'm not qualified to say that circumcision is always bad, because it isn't,"" says Lesley.
""It certainly was in my son's case and I think we need more research. We need to look into the risks, what can really go wrong, and we need to be more aware of them.""
If a circumcision is necessary, Mr Dorkin says it is important to tell patients about potential complications.
""Particularly when you are doing the operation in a guy who is in his late teenage years or early adulthood, it's a very sensitive area and sexual function is important, so you have to explain the risks to them,"" he says.
""Alex said he was not made aware of all the risks,"" says Lesley. ""If he had, I feel sure he would not have had the surgery.
""Alex wasn't alone. I now know he wasn't the only one that this has happened to. And that can't be right.""
The UK charity 15 Square, which tries to educate people about circumcision, says Alex is not the only man to have killed himself after being circumcised.
""It happens more frequently than people realise,"" says chairman David Smith.
There are no statistics on men who have killed themselves after being circumcised. Alex died over a year ago but his story has not been told until now. An inquest into his death was held in the UK but it was not reported by the media.
Lesley, who is normally private and reserved like her son, only agreed to share Alex's story because it was his dying wish.
""If the following information can benefit anybody then it has served its purpose,"" he wrote.
""I did not feel comfortable raising the issue when I had a choice, so if my story can raise awareness to break this taboo within society regarding men's health then I am happy for release of my words.
""Alex said in his letter 'We stand on the shoulders of those who came before us',"" says Lesley.
""This is the last thing I'm doing for my precious son.""

1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47969367,"US scientists say they used HIV to make a gene therapy that cured eight infants of severe combined immunodeficiency, or ""bubble boy"" disease. 
Results of the research, developed at a Tennessee hospital, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
The babies, born with little to no immune protection, now have fully functional immune systems.
Untreated babies with this disorder have to live in completely sterile conditions and tend to die as infants. 
The gene therapy involved collecting the babies' bone marrow and correcting the genetic defect in their DNA soon after their birth.
The ""correct"" gene - used to fix the defect - was inserted into an altered version of one of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
Researchers said most of the babies were discharged from the hospital within one month. 
Dr Ewelina Mamcarz of St Jude, an author of the study, said in a statement: ""These patients are toddlers now, who are responding to vaccinations and have immune systems to make all immune cells they need for protection from infections as they explore the world and live normal lives."" 
""This is a first for patients with SCID-X1,"" she added, referring to the most common type of SCID.
The patients were treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco. 
The case of David Vetter is perhaps the most famous case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a disease that made it impossible for him to engage with the world outside a plastic chamber.
Nicknamed ""Bubble Boy"", Vetter was born in 1971 with the disease and died at the age of 12 after a failed bone marrow transplant.
Within 20 seconds of his birth at the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, he was placed in a plastic isolation chamber, where he lived until the age of six when he was given a special plastic suit designed by Nasa, the US space agency.
His parents had already lost one child to the disease before he was born.
Currently, the best treatment for SCID-XI is a bone marrow transplant with a tissue-matched sibling donor. But according to St Jude, more than 80% of these patients lack such donors and must rely on blood stem cells from other donors.
This process is less likely to cure the bubble boy disease, and is more likely to cause serious side effects as a result of treatment. 
Previous advancements in gene therapy provided alternatives to a bone marrow transplant, but these treatments sometimes involved chemotherapy and had implications for a range of other diseases, including blood disorders, sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia, and metabolic syndrome.
Gene therapy treats 'bubble boy'",,,,
1904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-47964634,"When doctors wrote a question mark instead of a sex on her child's birth papers, Catherine filed a high court case that has prompted Kenya to start changing its approach to intersex children.
The year is 2009.
It's been five days since Catherine (not her real name) gave birth to her first child at the modest Nairobi home that she shares with her husband. But there's a problem.
""Something was off with my baby's body,"" she tells me.
Catherine asks her neighbour to come and take a look. She points at her child's genitalia and the neighbour bends down.
She looks silently.
Without attempting to diagnose a condition, she tells Catherine not to worry. She assures her that her child will be fine.
But Catherine wants a second opinion. This time she invites her cousin over.
""My cousin asked me what the problem was. I told her to just go ahead and check the baby.""
Catherine's cousin agrees that ""something looks off"". She advises her to visit the local hospital.
The next day Catherine and her husband go to their local doctor, who immediately refers them to Kenyatta National Hospital, the largest in the country.
The diagnosis from the hospital stuns the couple.
Catherine and her husband are told that their child is born with an intersex condition. The baby possesses both male and female genitalia.
In the paperwork where sex is to be marked, the doctor writes a question mark instead.
""After returning from Kenyatta with the doctor's report, that's when my husband started pulling back from me,"" says Catherine. ""He stopped leaving behind money for food.""
They began to fight.
Catherine's husband would yell at her that his family had no history of children with both a penis and a vagina, so there was no way that the child could be his.
""He used to hurl insults at me, calling me a prostitute. I asked if the baby wasn't his where did the child come from?"" Catherine says quietly. ""It is God who plans everything.""
Her husband refused to attend any future hospital appointments for the child. To Catherine it began to seem that she would be left to raise her intersex child singlehanded, and the prospect terrified her.
""I felt so alone and confused. One day I bought rat poison, so that I could kill myself and the baby. I mixed it in the meal. I remember it was beans.""
But she stopped herself at the last moment and ran to a church to speak to the pastor.
He reassured her that she was not alone, that other children like hers do exist in the world - her child was not an aberration or a curse.
""He told me that life will go on. The Lord will bless me and my child and both of us would survive.""
Catherine made a decision. One month after their child was born, she left her husband and moved in with her sister and her family.
She had been abused and shamed enough, and it wasn't the life she wanted for herself or her child.
Weeks after giving birth, with no income coming in, Catherine returned to work at a children's home weighted with worry.
One thing troubling her was the suggestion that her child should have corrective surgery.
""The doctor told me that the baby's male hormones were stronger than the female hormones and that we should have surgery to sew up the vagina and give male hormones.""
For a long time she resisted the idea, but just over a year after the birth, she gave consent, believing it would be in the best interest of her baby. She quickly came to regret it.
The second issue was the birth certificate.
In order to obtain a birth certificate in Kenya a sex needs to be assigned to the child, but Catherine only had the forms where hospital staff had put a question mark next to a box indicating sex.
A question mark meant that a birth certificate could not be issued - and nor could an identity card or passport in Kenya.
Catherine knew that without these documents, she could not enrol her child into school, and that as an adult her child would not be allowed to vote.
Eventually she confided in a colleague at work. He told her that he knew a man that may be able to help her. That was when Catherine met John Chigiti.
The midwife who saved intersex babies
Now I have a penis, I hope I will find love
Doctors hid secret from me
Earlier in the same year, 2010, John Chigiti had become well-known in Kenya as the lawyer representing Richard Muasya, an intersex person who had been sexually harassed in a male prison. The court rejected Muasya's plea to move to a female prison, but Chigiti earned a reputation as someone sympathetic towards intersex people, in a country where public opinion is often hostile.
The birth of children with intersex traits is often seen as a curse or bad omen on the family, with many killed in infancy.
Catherine wanted three things, identity documents for her child to be able to attend school, a law preventing surgery on intersex children unless it is medically necessary and proper information and psychological support for parents.
Chigiti agreed to represent her pro bono, and helped by a local NGO, The Cradle the Children Foundation, they filed a case with Kenya's High Court before the end of of the year.
In order to protect her child's identity, Catherine called her child Baby A, so the case became known as Baby A v. Attorney General, Kenyatta National Hospital, and the Registrar of Births and Deaths.
In a landmark ruling in 2014 the court ordered the government to issue a birth certificate to Catherine's five-year-old child.
In addition, it ordered the Attorney General to create a task force that would look at ways of providing better support for intersex children.
That task force handed in its recommendations to the Attorney General this week. Its recommendations include delaying surgery until children can choose for themselves and a robust survey on the number of intersex people in Kenya.
""Another strong recommendation is to have an 'I-marker'… an intersex marker to be put into public documentation,"" says Mbage Ng'ang'a, the Chair of the Kenya Law Reform Commission who headed the taskforce, ""as opposed to the binary state where we only recognise male and female in our official documentation.""
A number of countries recognise a third gender that can be registered on official documents once someone's gender identity becomes clear. The task force's plan is different - it's about sex rather than gender, and will register children as intersex at birth.
Mbage Ng'ang'a says parliamentarians have shown strong support for the recommendations and that 2019 will bring major changes for the rights of intersex people. The case of Baby A inspired this, he says.
These days Catherine survives by making and selling soap. Her immediate family and friends are aware of Baby A's medical history. They support her.
Some days she doesn't make any sales. ""But we get by,"" she says.
Catherine has raised Baby A, now almost 10, as a boy. 
She wonders if it was the right decision. Baby A doesn't seem comfortable as a boy, she says, but she hasn't asked him how he identifies.
She worries that he's a loner.
""He does not like company, you will not find him with other kids,"" she says.
She has a message for parents.
""If you have an intersex child, leave them alone and let them decide (on surgery) for themselves when they grow up.""
Even medical advice, she says, needs to based on research, not the doctor's instinct, or prejudice.
""Doctors are not gods.""

The story of Baby A also features in this video report by Megha Mohan published in January:

1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48120078,"Across the UK, record numbers of children are obese - but one city appears to have bucked the trend. 
Figures presented at an obesity conference suggest Leeds has managed to reduce child obesity rates by 6.4% over recent years. 
A key part of the city's strategy for tackling obesity was a focus on pre-school children and offering parents classes in how to encourage their children to be healthy.
But it's not always easy for parents and carers to know how to approach the subject of food. So what are the best things they can do?
Tina Le delivers similar workshops to those that have been taking place in Leeds to parents in east London.
She says giving children an input into what they eat from an early age, by offering a choice of two healthy options, can help guide them towards eating well. 
""This can help minimise the risk of refusing to eat something completely and it helps them feel in control,"" she says. 
""When we don't give children an option, they can feel quite shut down and a bit frustrated.""
Anna Groom, a paediatric dietician, admits it is not always easy if a child is a fussy eater. 
She says starting with small changes can reduce the pressure around meal times and avoid arguments. 
""It's important they have some safe foods that you know they like but then you can also introduce something new on their plate in just a tiny amount,"" she says. 
Belinda Mould found this approach worked well with her three-year-old daughter, who previously would only eat sausages and baked beans. 
""If we dished her up anything else she was throwing the food on the floor or just ignoring it and eating nothing,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. 
But she says by getting her to eat small amounts of new foods regularly, her daughter now eats virtually anything. 
""I say, 'you can have one mouthful just to try it and if you don't like it, you can have something else',"" Belinda says. 
""You need to be persistent,"" she adds. ""So if they reject it, try again another time.""
Tina says setting a good example for a child from a young age is also key.
""If you're eating healthily yourself, your child is more likely to model what you're doing,"" she says. 
She adds that eating together at meal times also helps to encourage younger children to mimic their parents' eating habits. 
Anna adds that it is important for parents not to voice negative opinions about foods they don't like around their children, as this can influence their attitudes towards new foods. 
Offering rewards and praise for eating healthily can reinforce good habits, Tina says. 
However, she stresses rewards should not be related to food but instead an activity like going to the park, doing some colouring or putting a sticker on a chart. 
""We always say avoid bribing,"" she says. 
""Don't say if you eat this you'll get a chocolate or some ice cream because that makes them feel the food we are asking them to eat is worth less than the reward.""
Especially for older children, food and weight can be a sensitive topic, and concerns about how they look can contribute to issues with self-esteem. 
A recent study found that obesity and mental health were closely linked, with obese children more likely to suffer from emotional problems like anxiety and low mood. 
Tina recommends framing conversations about food in a way that avoids linking healthy eating to a child's appearance. 
""Encourage them to be healthy because it makes them feel good, rather than because it makes them look a certain way,"" she says.
Anna agrees that language is key when addressing the issue of weight. 
""It's important that the family are encouraged to make changes as a whole so the child doesn't feel singled out,"" she says. 
""Saying things like, 'Let's become healthier as a family', means the child may not even have any idea that the parent is concerned about their weight but still improves their diet.""",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48094398,"Dementia is the greatest health challenge of our time, the charity Alzheimer's Research UK has warned. 
Dementia was first described by the German doctor Alois Alzheimer in 1906 after he performed an autopsy on a woman with profound memory loss.
What he found was a dramatically shrunken brain and abnormalities in and around nerve cells.
At the time dementia was rare and was then barely studied for decades.
But today somebody is diagnosed with it every three seconds, it is the biggest killer in some wealthier countries and is completely untreatable. 
So what is this disease? Why is it becoming more common? And is there any hope?
No - dementia is a symptom found in many diseases of the brain. 
Memory loss is the most common feature of dementia, particularly the struggle to remember recent events.
Other symptoms can include changes to behaviour, mood and personality, becoming lost in familiar places or being unable to find the right word in a conversation. 
It can reach the point where people don't know they need to eat or drink.
Alzheimer's disease is by far the most common of the diseases that cause dementia. 
Others include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the newly discovered Late.
Globally around 50 million people are currently living with dementia. 
But cases are predicted to soar to 130 million by 2050 as populations age.
According to the World Health Organization, deaths from dementia have doubled since 2000 and dementia is now the fifth biggest killer worldwide. 
But dementia has already claimed number one spot in some richer countries.
In England and Wales, one in eight death certificates cite dementia. 
There is also a key difference with other major killers such as cancer or heart disease, because there is not a single treatment that either cures or slows the pace of any dementia. 
""Dementia certainly is the biggest health challenge of our time,"" Hilary Evans, chief executive of the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC.
""It's the one that will continue to rise in terms of prevalence, unless we can do something to stop or cure this disease.""
As the disease progresses, people eventually need full-time care and the annual cost of looking after people with dementia is in the region of $1 trillion a year.
The answer is simple - we are living longer and the biggest risk factor for dementia is age.
That is why huge increases in dementia cases are predicted for Asia and Africa.
With a more philosophical hat on, you can see dementia as the price we pay for progress in treating deadly infections, heart attacks and cancer. 
Although there is an unexpected and hopeful trend emerging that has surprised some in the field - the proportion of elderly people getting dementia is falling in some countries.
Studies have shown the dementia rate (the number of cases per 1,000 people) falling in the UK, Spain and the US and stabilising in other countries.
This is largely being put down to improvements in areas like heart health and education which in turn benefit the brain.
Not necessarily.
There used to be a public perception that dementia was a normal part of the ageing process. 
However, the research is clear - dementia is caused by disease.
And some people who live well into their 90s and beyond have brains that remain remarkably clear of any signs of dementia. 
Prof Tara Spires-Jones, the deputy director of the centre for discovery brain sciences at the University of Edinburgh,  said: ""I think there are some people who would be fine, even if they lived for another 100 years.""
Be in no doubt - even a drug that just slows the progression of dementia would make someone a fortune.
It is not for the want of trying that there is no treatment for dementia. 
Aducanumab, a drug that many hoped would work in Alzheimer's disease, is just the latest to fall by the wayside. 
In March this year, Biogen and Eisai announced their drug was unlikely to be effective and ended the trial early. 
Aducanumab, like those that have failed before, had been designed to target a toxic protein called amyloid beta that builds up inside the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
If you go back to Dr Alzheimer in 1906, then some of the abnormalities he found in that brain autopsy were plaques of amyloid beta. 
So a clear connection between amyloid beta and Alzheimer's emerged and the assumption was that the protein was killing brain cells. 
Therefore removing amyloid beta should save brain cells and slam the brakes on Alzheimer's, experts thought.
The drug companies poured in.
Ms Evans said: ""Some pharmaceutical companies were jumping on that thinking it was going to be the golden bullet, that hasn't been the case.""
And they left other avenues, relatively, unexplored.
""A lot of pharmaceutical companies put all their eggs in one basket,"" says Ms Evans.
Has science made a massive, expensive mistake? Is the ""amyloid hypothesis"" dead? These are questions being asked.
Prof Bart De Strooper, the director of UK Dementia Research Institute, told me: ""The amyloid hypothesis as has been formulated over the last 20 years is dead, that I would accept.
""What I won't accept is that the importance of amyloid is dead.""
There is a tonne of evidence that supports amyloid having a role in some dementias.
This includes genetic studies on people with familial dementia, who develop the disease in their 30s and 40s. It is caused by rare mutations in their DNA that alter the way amyloid works in the body. 
Prof De Strooper says: ""The genetic evidence for amyloid is so strong that it's hard to go to the other side, which says that amyloid has nothing to do with the disease.
""What we need is a new theory.""
The role of amyloid beta is being reimagined.
So instead of being the toxic protein that chokes nerve cells to death, it is being seen as the initial step that culminates in the dementia. 
Prof Spires-Jones said: ""Some people call it a trigger and once you've pulled the trigger then the bullet is on its way.
""So doing anything to the trigger is no longer an effective method.""
The optimistic view is that anti-amyloid drugs may have a role in preventing Alzheimer's, but only if they are used before the disease starts. 
That may be why the current Alzheimer's drug trials have failed, because people are being treated too late.
Some researchers are pinning hopes on another protein called tau. 
If amyloid beta is the trigger, tau may be the bullet.
""Tau is one of my favourite proteins, where there's tau there's cell death in the brain,"" says Prof Spires-Jones.
""I think tau is very important for somehow causing the cells to get sick and die.""
However, again this is not 100% certain and there is no evidence in human trials that lowering levels of tau in the brain is going to stop neurones dying. 
Focusing on neurones and dangerous proteins can miss the bigger picture of what is happening in the brain. 
This is a lesson being learned from cancer, where understanding the role the immune system plays has led to a whole new branch of medicine - cancer immunotherapy.
The immune system is being heavily implicated in dementia too. 
If you look at genetic mutations that increase the risk of developing dementia, then a good chunk of them are involved in the immune system. 
While your brain is packed with neurones that do the ""thinking"" - they are ably assisted by special immune cells called microglia. 
They do fight infections, but also keep the brain running smoothly by munching up anything that should not be there. 
And the blood vessels in the brain are increasingly being seen as a key player, not just in vascular dementia, but other dementias too. 
Prof De Strooper still sees abnormal proteins as the trigger, but ""then you have the response of the brain on that threat"". 
He told the BBC: ""Some people have very good genes, very strong inflammation response or a very good vascular (blood vessel) response, and they will maintain good health even while these biochemical changes are present in the brain.""
And, on the flip side, some people who are genetically programmed to respond poorly would go on to develop dementia symptoms. 
Prof De Strooper said: ""All of a sudden, you open a broad box of possible drug targets, because you can then start to think about how do we improve the response of the brain at the inflammatory side, at the vascular side, at the neuronal side? 
""That's what at this moment is happening.""
""Unfortunately, we don't have a full understanding,"" says Prof Spires-Jones.
She said there were key gaps in our knowledge:
""So there's some big questions left that we need to understand in order to effectively treat the disease,"" she said.
But we have switched from talking about all dementias to mostly Alzheimer's disease, where most of the medical research has been focused.
Each type of dementia has different traits, with different parts of the brain affected and different aberrant proteins building up in the brain.
For example, alpha-synuclein builds up in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia.  
There may need to be different treatments targeting different proteins and confusingly some patients have ""mixed dementia"", with multiple diseases playing out at the same time.
There are two significant factors - one is the sheer complexity of the brain and the other is a lack of funding for research. 
The human brain is the most complex structure in the known universe and is made up of 100 billion neurones.
To steal Prof de Strooper's analogy; if every person on the planet (currently around 7.5 billion) had a computer and they were all hooked up and working together - that would still be less than a tenth of what's going on inside the brain. 
And yet for every single scientific study published on any form of neurodegeneration, there are 12 on cancer. 
The focus has simply been elsewhere.
Less than you might think.
While completely curing all forms of dementia is the goal, there could be huge benefits from drugs that just slow the pace of a dementia. 
An analysis by Alzheimer's Research UK argued a drug that delayed the onset of dementia by five years would cut the number of people living with the disease by a third.
The reason is dementia tends to be a disease of old age, and if you can buy just a little bit of time then you may well have died of other causes before your brain is affected.
Slowing the decline would also keep people living independently for longer. 
Prof Spires-Jones said: ""How resilient is the brain? It's phenomenal!""
After a stroke kills brain cells it is possible to regain some degree of lost function. But this does not come from growing new brain cells, but rewiring those that remain. 
Prof Spires-Jones told the BBC: ""In Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, there's a similar amount of ability of the brain to cope by changing the network.""
In fact, huge amounts of damage have already been done to the brain by the time somebody is diagnosed with Alzheimer's by their family doctor. 
""When you look at people at that stage, they've already lost half of the neurones in a part of the brain really important for memory, the entorhinal cortex,"" Prof Spires-Jones said.
But that creates a new problem - starting treatment at this stage is not going to recover those lost brain cells. You are mostly born with all the brain cells you will ever have (there are some exceptions).
Let's fast forward to a world where we do have treatments and now the brain's great asset, its adaptability, is the problem as it may have masked the disease for more than a decade. 
Ms Evans, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""There's no point halting the progression of the disease in end stage disease.""
But equally it will not be practical for everybody to have a regular brain scan to catch dementia early, because those scans are incredibly expensive. 
One option is the approach taken in heart disease, where millions of people take pills to lower cholesterol levels in order to stop their arteries being clogged up. 
Statins lower risk before people have a medical problem. 
Ms Evans said: ""I think the analogy with statins is a good one.
""I think there could be something that in mid-life, you would be able to take that could then lower your risk or ensure that the development of this disease would be slow.""
Prof de Strooper envisages a system of screening people that may even start at birth with a DNA test that predicts who is at greater risk.
Then regular cognitive tests throughout life would act like an early warning system for people who need a more detailed examination. 
And patients who turn out to already have a diseased brain would be offered drugs that stop brain cells dying, all before symptoms emerge.
There are no guarantees, but there are ways you can lower the odds of developing dementia. 
Research estimates that one in three cases could be prevented by lifestyle changes including:
It is not completely clear why these protect the brain. 
Do these lifestyle factors actually stop the process of dementia in the brain?
Or do they prepare the brain for dementia by increasing the connections and flexibility of the brain so that as neurones start to die, the brain can compensate for longer and symptoms don't emerge?
On a personal level it probably doesn't matter - not getting dementia, is not getting dementia. But scientifically the questions matter as the answers will illuminate what is going on in the brain. 
""People who are very healthy and take good care of themselves are the group that I would say is most resilient to Alzheimer's disease,"" says Prof Spires-Jones.
There is now far more money being spent on dementia research. 
The optimistic view is that we are at the same point as the Aids crisis was in the 1980s, when an HIV infection was a death sentence. 
But now people who get anti-viral drugs have a nearly normal life expectancy. 
Prof Spires-Jones said: ""We know from things like cancer, that if you do a lot of science and research into a field, you can make a huge difference and find cures and treatments for these complex diseases. 
""So I think we'll get there, but we do need to understand more about the fundamental brain changes in order to come up with effective treatments.""
Ms Evans said: ""There are potential trials, within this year, coming to fruition, I would hope to see some positive stories out of those in the next year or two.
And Prof de Strooper expects the first treatment within a decade: ""It will not cure all dementia, I think we will have to cope with that for a long time. 
""But it will certainly postpone the disease, you will decay much slower, and dementia will be much less a threat for the society.""

1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48132595,"A donor kidney has been delivered to surgeons at a US hospital via drone, in the first flight of its kind.
Many see huge potential for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) delivering medical products, with some drones already doing so in Africa.
The US flight required a specially-designed drone which was able to maintain and monitor the organ.
It is hoped that it can pave the way for longer flights and address safety issue with current transport methods.
The recipient, a 44-year-old from Baltimore, had waited eight years for the transplant.
She said of the unusual delivery method: ""This whole thing is amazing. Years ago, this was not something that you would think about.""
According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages organ transplants in the US, in 2018 there were nearly 114,000 people on waiting lists, with 1.5% of organs not making it to the destination and nearly 4% being delayed by two hours or more.
""Delivering an organ from a donor to a patient is a sacred duty with many moving parts. It is critical that we find ways of doing this better,"" said Joseph Scalea, assistant professor of surgery at University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM), and one of the surgeons who performed the transplant.
""As a result of the outstanding collaboration among surgeons, engineers, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), organ procurement specialists, pilots, nurses, and, ultimately, the patient, we were able to make a pioneering breakthrough in transplantation."" 
The three-mile journey required a lot of new technology, including a custom-made drone capable of carrying the additional weight of an organ, which also needed on-board cameras and organ tracking, and communications and safety systems for a flight over an urban, densely-populated area.
It also had a parachute recovery system in case the aircraft failed.
""There's a tremendous amount of pressure knowing there's a person waiting for that organ, but it's also a special privilege to be a part of this critical mission,"" said Matthew Scassero, part of the engineering team based at the University of Maryland.
Charlie Alexander, chief executive of The Living Legacy Foundation of Maryland, a charity working to increase organ donation, said: ""If we can prove that this works, then we can look at much greater distances of unmanned organ transport. 
""This would minimise the need for multiple pilots and flight time and address safety issues we have in our field.""",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-48132490,"A fresh inquest will be held into the death of a nine-year-old girl whose fatal asthma attack may have been linked to air pollution near her home.
Ella Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south east London, died in 2013 after having seizures for three years.
The High Court granted a new inquest after Ella's mother said more evidence had come to light.
Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said she was ""delighted"" by the ruling.
In a statement, she said she was looking forward to ""finally getting the truth"".
""The past six years of not knowing why my beautiful, bright and bubbly daughter died has been difficult for me and my family, but I hope the new inquest will answer whether air pollution took her away from us,"" she said.
""If it is proved that pollution killed Ella then the government will be forced to sit up and take notice that this hidden but deadly killer is cutting short our children's lives."" 
Ella was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit and subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times.
An inquest in 2014, which focused on Ella's medical care, concluded her death was caused by acute respiratory failure and severe asthma.
But a 2018 report said it was likely unlawful levels of pollution, which were detected at a monitoring station one mile from Ella's home, contributed to her fatal asthma attack.
Ruling with two other judges that the 2014 conclusions should be quashed, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said: ""In our judgment, the discovery of new evidence makes it necessary in the interests of justice that a fresh inquest be held.""
He said Ella's family's lawyers had argued the new evidence demonstrated there was an ""arguable failure"" by the state to comply with its duties under the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to life.
Ella may become the first person in the UK for whom air pollution is listed as the cause of death.",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48124007,"Further evidence that taking anti-HIV drugs stops gay men passing on the virus to sexual partners has been called a ""powerful message"" which should be more widely known.
A study of nearly 1,000 gay male couples in The Lancet found no cases of HIV transmission over eight years.
This was due to treatment reducing the virus to very low levels in the body.
""Undetectable equals untransmittable"" should be basic HIV knowledge for everyone, experts said.
The European study followed 972 gay male couples - where one was living with HIV and taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the other was HIV negative - over eight years, from 2010-2017.
There were no cases of HIV being passed within the couples over that time.
And the researchers say that around 472 cases of HIV are likely to have been prevented.
In total, the couples reported having anal sex without condoms a total of 76,088 times. 
Although 15 men did become infected with HIV during the study, genetic testing showed that none of the viruses came from their main partner.
""Our findings provide conclusive evidence that the risk of HIV transmission through anal sex when HIV viral load is suppressed is effectively zero,"" the researchers said. 
Prof Alison Rodger, study author and professor of infectious diseases at University College London, said anal sex was known to have the highest risk of transmission, but gay men should be reassured.
""This powerful message can help end the HIV pandemic by preventing HIV transmission, and tackling the stigma and discrimination that many people with HIV face.""
She called for all people living with HIV to have access to testing and effective treatment.
Matt Stokes, 26, was diagnosed with HIV in 2016 and started drug therapy four weeks later. Tests showed the virus was undetectable in his body within three months.
""It's a huge relief and gives me self confidence to know I can't pass on the virus,"" he says.
""Among the gay community and my friends there has been a real change in recent years - you can put 'undetectable' on Grindr, for example.""
But there's a long way to go before everyone knows what it means, he adds.
""Some people don't want to believe it. They have an irrational fear it might not be true.""
He says charities campaigning on the issue are giving the message ""a huge boost"" and changing views on sex.
Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT (National AIDS Trust) said more should be done to get the message out to healthcare workers and the general public.
""There needs to be a much better understanding of how HIV is and isn't transmitted, and the fact that treatment stops transmission, in the NHS and beyond. We think this is vital to addressing stigma.""
Previous research has shown zero risk for heterosexual couples of passing on the virus, when one person is taking HIV treatment, prompting UNAIDS to launch its undetectable = untransmittable campaign.
Dr Ford Hickson, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the study confirmed that if people suppress their HIV with antiretroviral therapy, they ""cannot pass their virus to other people during sex, whatever kind of sex they have"". 
In the study, the men with HIV had been taking antiretroviral therapy for an average of four years before it began, making the virus undetectable - defined as fewer than 200 copies per ml of blood.
Most people reach this level after taking daily HIV treatment for six months.
It is a combination of drugs, to be taken daily, to stop HIV replicating in the body.
It can't cure HIV, but it can reduce the amount of virus to undetectable levels in the blood.
Most people with HIV take a combination pill once a day but others can take up to four pills a day depending on their specific health needs.
Everyone is recommended to start treatment straight away after being diagnosed.
Dr Michael Brady, medical director at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ""The study has given us the confidence to say, without doubt, that people living with HIV who are on effective treatment cannot pass the virus on to their sexual partners. 
""This has incredible impact on the lives of people living with HIV and is a powerful message to address HIV-related stigma.""
In the UK, 98% of people diagnosed with HIV are receiving treatment - and 97% of those have an undetectable level of the virus - meaning they are unable to pass on the infection.
But figures from Public Health England estimate than only 92% of the 101,600 of people living with HIV have been diagnosed.",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48151105,"Leonardo da Vinci could have experienced nerve damage in a fall, impeding his ability to paint in later life, Italian doctors suggest.
They diagnosed ulnar palsy, or ""claw hand"", by analysing the depiction of his right hand in two artworks.
It had been suggested that Leonardo's hand impairment was caused by a stroke.
But in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, the doctors suggest it was nerve damage that meant he could no longer hold a palette and brush.
Leonardo da Vinci, who lived from 1452-1519, was an artist and inventor whose talents included architecture, anatomy, engineering and sculpture, as well as painting.
But art historians have debated which hand he used to draw and paint with.
Analysis of his drawing shows shading sloping from the upper left to lower right, suggesting left-handedness. But all historical biographical documents suggest Leonardo used his right hand when he was creating other kinds of works.
For this research, two artworks - showing Leonardo da Vinci in the latter stages of his life - were analysed. One is a portrait of the artist, drawn with red chalk, attributed to the 16th-century Lombard artist Giovanni Ambrogio Figino. 
Unusually, it shows his right arm largely concealed in folds of clothing. His hand is visible, but in a ""stiff, contracted position"".
Dr Davide Lazzeri, a specialist in plastic reconstructive and aesthetic surgery at the Villa Salaria Clinic in Rome, who led the analysis, said: ""Rather than depicting the typical clenched hand seen in post-stroke muscular spasticity, the picture suggests an alternative diagnosis such as ulnar palsy, commonly known as 'claw hand'.""
The ulnar nerve runs from the shoulder to the little finger, and manages almost all the intrinsic hand muscles that allow fine motor movements, so a fall could have caused trauma to his upper arm, leading to the palsy, or weakness.
There are no reports of any cognitive decline or other motor impairment, which offers further evidence that a stroke was an unlikely cause of Leonardo's impairment. Dr Lazzeri said.
He added: ""This may explain why he left numerous paintings incomplete, including the Mona Lisa, during the last five years of his career as a painter, while he continued teaching and drawing.""
A further image, an engraving of a man playing a lira da braccio - a Renaissance string instrument - was examined. The man in the engraving was recently identified as Leonardo da Vinci. Further evidence was obtained from a diary entry by a Cardinal's assistant about a visit to the artist's house in 1517.
The assistant, Antonio de Beatis wrote: ""One cannot indeed expect any more good work from him as a certain paralysis has crippled his right hand... And although Messer Leonardo can no longer paint with the sweetness which was peculiar to him, he can still design and instruct others.""",,,,

Mr Hancock told the BBC he did not want to ""reach the point"" of imposing jabs, but would ""rule nothing out"".
More than half a million children in the UK were unvaccinated against measles from 2010 to 2017, Unicef says. 
In March, the head of NHS England warned ""vaccination deniers"" were gaining traction on social media.
The health secretary was speaking after a report in The Times claimed almost 40,000 British parents had joined an online group calling for children to be left unimmunised against potentially fatal diseases such as tetanus.
And in England, the proportion of children receiving both doses of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) jab by their fifth birthday has fallen over the last four years to 87.2%.
This is below the 95% said by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be the level necessary to protect a population from a disease.
The UK was declared free of the highly contagious measles disease for the first time by the WHO in 2017.
But in 2018, it experienced small outbreaks, and in March this year there was a sharp increase of cases across Greater Manchester.
Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hancock said: ""Failure to vaccinate when there isn't a good reason is wrong.
""These people who campaign against vaccinations are campaigning against science - the science is settled.
""I don't want to have to reach the point of compulsory vaccination, and I don't think we are near there, but I will rule nothing out.""
He said the failure to vaccinate children put at risk those who could not be vaccinated for medical reasons.
""Vaccination is good for you, good for your child, good for your neighbour and your community,"" he added.",,,,

Family, friends and school life all had a greater impact on wellbeing, says the University of Oxford research team.
It claims its study is more in-depth and robust than previous ones.
And it urged companies to release data on how people use social media in order to understand more about the impact of technology on young people's lives.
The study, published in the journal PNAS, attempts to answer the question of whether teenagers who use social media more than average have lower life satisfaction, or whether adolescents with lower life satisfaction use more social media.
Past research on the relationship between screens, technology and children's mental health has often been contradictory.
Prof Andrew Przybylski and Amy Orben, from the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford, say it is often based on limited evidence which does not give the full picture.
Their study concluded that most links between life satisfaction and social media use were ""trivial"", accounting for less than 1% of a teenager's wellbeing - and that the effect of social media was ""not a one-way street"".
Prof Przybylski, director of research at the institute, said: ""99.75% of a person's life satisfaction has nothing to do with their use of social media.""
The study, which took place between 2009 and 2017, asked thousands of 10 to 15-year-olds to say how long they spent using social media on a normal school day and also rate how satisfied they were with different aspects of life.
They found more effects of time spent on social media in girls, but they were tiny and no larger than effects found in boys.
Less than half of these effects were statistically significant, they said. 
""Parents shouldn't worry about time on social media - thinking about it that way is wrong,"" Prof Przybylski said.
""We are fixated on time - but we need to retire this notion of screen time.
""The results are not showing evidence for great concern.""
The researchers said it was now important to identify young people at greater risk from certain effects of social media, and find out other factors that were having an impact on their wellbeing.
They plan to meet social media companies soon to discuss how they can work together to learn more about how people use apps - not just the time spent on them.
Ms Orben, co-study author and psychology lecturer at University of Oxford, said the industry must release their usage data and support independent research.
""Access is key to understanding the many roles that social media plays in the lives of young people"" she said.
Dr Max Davie, officer for health improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, backed the call for companies to collaborate with scientists and called the study ""the first small step"".
However, he said there were other issues to explore, such as screen time's interference with other important activities like sleep, exercise and time with family or friends.
""We recommend that families follow our guidance published earlier this year and continue to avoid screen use for one hour before bed, since there are other reasons beside mental health for children to need a good night's sleep.""",,,,

The Mongolian couple contracted the illness after eating the raw meat of a marmot, a type of rodent.
Following their deaths, a six-day quarantine was declared on 1 May in Mongolia's western Bayan Olgii province bordering both China and Russia. 
In previous centuries plague outbreaks killed millions in Europe and Asia.
Human cases are now rare but can still be deadly unless treated with antibiotics.
The couple had eaten raw marmot meat and kidney, thought to be a folk remedy for good health, Ariuntuya Ochirpurev of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Ulaanbaatar told the BBC. 
Suspicion the two victims had developed the highly contagious pneumonic plague led to the decision to impose the quarantine, Ms Ochirpurev added.
The rodent is a known carrier of the plague bacteria and it is commonly associated with plague cases in the country. Hunting the rodent is illegal. 
According to Ms Ochirpurev, 118 people had come into contact with the couple and were isolated and treated with antibiotics for prophylaxis.
Among those were seven foreign tourists from Switzerland, Sweden, Kazakhstan and South Korea.
Media reports, however, put the number of tourists much higher, saying travellers from Russia, Germany and the US were barred from leaving the area due to the quarantine. 
""After the quarantine [was announced] not many people, even locals, were in the streets for fear of catching the disease,"" Sebastian Pique, a US Peace Corps volunteer living in the region, told the AFP news agency.
While rare, the plague still continues to be a threat to humans. 
The disease - typically transmitted from animals to humans by fleas - has a 30%-60% fatality rate if left untreated. 
In Mongolia, one case was reported in 2017 but it was not fatal. In 2016, no cases were reported. 
From 1989 to 1997, there were 69 cases in the country and 22 deaths, according to the WHO's Ms Ochirpurev.
The US also still has annual cases of the disease and 12 recorded fatalities since 2000. 
In 2015, parts of the Yosemite National Park had to be closed due to an outbreak of the plague. 
Symptoms of the plague include high fever, chills, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpit or groin.
It can be hard to identify in its early stages because symptoms, which usually develop after three to seven days, are flu-like. 
There are three main types of plague depending on how the infection manifests. The bubonic plague is characterised by swollen lymph nodes. Pneumonic plague affects the respiratory system. It becomes septicaemic if it is found in the bloodstream.
The Black Death, as it was known at the time, caused about 50 million deaths across Africa, Asia and Europe in the 14th Century.
Its last terrifying outbreak in London was the Great Plague of 1665, which killed about a fifth of the city's inhabitants. In the 19th Century there was a plague outbreak in China and India, which killed more than 12 million.",,,,

The motion was put to a public vote on Tuesday, and passed with a slim majority of 50.6%.
Although the mushrooms will technically still be illegal, restrictions on personal use and possession by adults will be drastically loosened.
Police officers will now be instructed to treat magic mushroom users as their lowest priority.
Denver decriminalised cannabis in 2005 ahead of the rest of the state of Colorado. Tuesday's referendum was  the first US public vote on magic mushrooms.
They are a form of fungus found across the world which contains a psychedelic chemical called psilocybin.
The UK's National Health Service describes them as a hallucinogenic ""making people see, hear and experience the world in a different, 'trippy' way"".
Westerners began taking them as a recreational drug in the 1950s but they may have been used long before that in rituals in parts of the world such as Central America. 
Under US federal law, psilocybin belongs in the same group of banned drugs as heroin and LSD, and it has been designated a Class A drug in the UK since 2005.
The US federal government argues that psilocybin has high abuse potential and no accepted medical value.
The drug remains illegal in many other countries. 
Campaigners in Denver say certain mushrooms ""may be helpful in the treatment of cluster headaches, PTSD [Post Traumatic Stress Disorder] and OCD [Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder]"".
Advocates say that a growing body of evidence suggests that the drug has therapeutic benefits for a wide range of illnesses, from anxiety to addiction. 
A UK study in 2016, found a hallucinogenic chemical in magic mushrooms shows promise for people with untreatable depression. 
In Iowa, a Republican lawmaker recently introduced two bills to remove magic mushrooms from the state's list of controlled substances. 
In two other US states - Oregon and California - campaigns have launched to have similar issues on the ballot for the 2020 elections. 
Officials will now be barred from ""spending resources to impose criminal penalties"" for personal use and possession of the drug for residents over the age of 21, effectively preventing the city from prosecuting or arresting adults found with mushrooms. 
According to the ballot, adults can even grow mushrooms for personal use. 
But psilocybin is not being legalised and cannot be sold by cannabis businesses.
Before the vote Denver's district attorney, Beth McCann, said that although she was against the motion, if it passed she would support the formation of a review panel to study the effects of the drug.
The changes could take effect as soon as next year. 
Kevin Matthews, who led the campaign to decriminalise the mushrooms, told the Denver Post: ""Against all odds, we prevailed. This is what happens when a small team of dedicated and passionate people unite under a single idea to create change.""
His group Decriminalise Denver, which was behind the initiative, said: ""No-one should go to jail, lose their children, lose their job, and lose their citizen's rights for using a mushroom. One arrest is too many for something with such low and manageable risks for most people, relative to its potential benefits.""
Several major figures opposed decriminalisation, including Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and Ms McCann. 
Ms McCann told the Washington Post: ""At this point, I don't think it's a good idea. We're still figuring out marijuana, and even though things are going well so far, we're still measuring the impacts on the people of Denver.""",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48199915,"An experimental cocktail of viruses has saved the life of a teenager who had a deadly and seemingly untreatable infection.
Isabelle's body was being attacked by bacteria and she was given less than a 1% chance of survival.
But doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital attempted an untested ""phage therapy"", which uses viruses to infect and kill bacteria.
Isabelle is now learning to drive and studying for her A-levels. 
Experts said the case was ""enormously exciting"" and showed the potential for treating other dangerous infections with phage. 
They are the microbial embodiment of the adage: ""My enemy's enemy is my friend.""
Phages, also known as bacteriophages, are a type of naturally occurring virus that infects bacteria rather than the body's own cells. 
Looking like sinister aliens, they land on the surface of a bacterium and inject their own genetic code.
This hijacks the bacterial cell, turning it into a phage factory until the viruses eventually burst out of the cell.
Isabelle Carnell-Holdaway was born with cystic fibrosis. It causes sticky mucus to develop inside her lungs, which can harbour dangerous infections. 
A relative of tuberculosis - Mycobacterium abscessus - infected her body and she needed potent antibiotics to keep it in check.  
When she was 16, she needed a double lung transplant, but the bacteria were still hiding in her body.
When she started immunosuppressant drugs to prevent her rejecting the transplant, the infection came back.  
Her doctor, Helen Spencer, said: ""For patients with re-growth of Mycobacterium after transplant, in our experience, all have gone on and died.
""For some patients, that's within a year despite aggressive treatment."" 
Isabelle had big, black, festering lesions forming on her skin where the infection was taking hold. 
And she ended up in intensive care when her liver started failing, with large colonies of bacteria forming in her body. 
Doctors said there was nothing they could do, and that Isabelle had a less than 1% chance of survival.
Her parents decided to take her home where she would be surrounded by family. 
The idea for attempting phage therapy came from Isabelle's mother, Jo, who had been researching alternatives on the internet.
The team at Great Ormond Street contacted Prof Graham Hatfull, at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, in the US, who had the world's largest collection of phages.
He had about 15,000 vials of phage but it took months to work out which combination of phages might work against Isabelle's infection.
The US team settled on three phages - two of which they genetically modified to make them more effective. 
The therapy was injected into her blood stream twice a day and applied to the lesions on her skin, according to the journal Nature Medicine.
Isabelle's mum, Jo, noticed the difference within weeks. She is in no doubt her daughter's life was saved by the viruses. 
Isabelle's lesions started to heal and some wounds that had been open for months started to close.
Jo told BBC News: ""When we left hospital, she literally looked like a skeleton with skin on, she was so poorly.
""It was absolutely incredible the effect the phage had on her.
""She's got back her own life, the life of a 17-year-old girl.""
Isabelle went back to school in September, passed her GCSE maths and is now studying for her A-levels. 
She's also learning to drive.
She told the BBC: ""It's an incredible thing, it's still working slowly, it's just great being able to do all these things on my own without having any problems.""
Isabelle's fatal infection has not been completely cured - but it is under control. 
She is still having two infusions of the viral cocktail every day.
And the family are waiting for a fourth phage to be added to the mix in an attempt to clear her of the infection completely. 
Dr Spencer told BBC News: ""It's amazing really, but also tinged with sadness when I think of all the patients that did not survive as the treatment was not available in time for them.""
Isabelle's story is remarkable, but also only a single case. 
Technically, scientists cannot be certain how effective the phage is without performing clinical trials.
Dr Spencer added: ""We have to be really cautious about extrapolating a single individual case to other patients and what it might mean for them.
""But I think it does encourage future research into phage therapy for some of those resistant bacteria that we're really becoming concerned about.""
No, some doctors have been using phages for nearly a century.
The field developed in Georgia and other countries in the former USSR, but never became mainstream medicine. 
Phage-therapy was eclipsed by the discovery of antibiotics, which are much easier to use.
One antibiotic can work across a broad range of bacterial infections, while phage-therapy requires finding the precise phages that will attack each infection. 
But now phage-therapy is having a resurgence due to the rise of superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics.
This is the big question and at the moment there is no clear answer. 
Prof Graham Hatfull, from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, said: ""We're sort of in uncharted territory.
""The idea is to use bacteriophages as antibiotics, as something we could use to kill bacteria that cause infection.""
But to use phage more widely would require careful matching of phages to a patient's infection. 
Prof Martha Clokie, a phage researcher at the University of Leicester, told BBC News: ""I think that this work is enormously exciting. 
""It shows how bacteriophages can be successfully developed as therapeutics even in very difficult circumstances where bacteria are resistant to many antibiotics and the bacteria are difficult to treat. 
""I think it will pave the way for other such studies and help with getting the necessary trials carried out on bacteriophages so that they can be used more widely to treat humans.""

1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48207396,"Giving the hormone progesterone to women who have had a miscarriage and experience early bleeding in pregnancy could improve their chances of having baby, a study suggests.
A small number of women could potentially be helped, a trial found.
Samantha Allen, 31, experienced spotting when she lost her first baby and then again during her second pregnancy.
After taking the hormone for eight weeks, she gave birth to her son Noah.
Progesterone is a hormone essential in pregnancy - for maintaining the lining of the womb where the embryo is implanted and for supporting the immune system.
Samantha was prescribed progesterone pessaries for the Birmingham trial, which she took twice a day until she was 16 weeks' pregnant.
She said the bleeding stopped within a week of starting the trial and the pregnancy progressed very smoothly.
She now hopes that more women who have had a miscarriage could benefit.
""I just hope they don't have to go through the same heartache - it does take its toll on you,"" she said.
Miscarriage affects one in five women, and vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy is linked to an increased risk of it happening.
With progesterone already used in IVF treatment, Samantha said that she had no qualms about taking part in the trial.
""I feel happy that I did participate. It didn't feel like a risk because it wasn't an early stage trial.""
The University of Birmingham study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, involved one group of around 2,000 pregnant women given progesterone, while another group of the same number were given a placebo, or dummy pill.
All the women had experienced bleeding in early pregnancy.
Although the study showed that not all women with early bleeding could be helped by taking the hormone, the benefits were greatest among women with a history of recurrent miscarriages (three or more).
Among those women, there was a 15% increase in the live birth rate - with 98 out of 137 women going on to have a baby, compared with 85 out of 148 in the placebo group.
Arri Coomarasamy, study leader and consultant gynaecologist at Birmingham Women and Children's Hospital, said the treatment could save thousands of babies' lives.
""We hope that this evidence will be considered by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and that it will be used to update national guidelines for women at risk of miscarriage,"" he said.
At present, when women are potentially miscarrying, ""there is nothing we can offer them"", he says.
But he said that the treatment would not work for all women who miscarry, because there were many complex reasons why miscarriage occurs. 
Only those women with a progesterone-related problem could benefit, he added.
Jane Brewin, chief executive of miscarriage charity Tommy's, said: ""The results from this study are important for parents who have experienced miscarriage; they now have a robust and effective treatment option which will save many lives and prevent much heartache. 
""It gives us confidence to believe that further research will yield more treatments and ultimately make many more miscarriages preventable.""",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-47816210,"Meat-free foods that ""bleed"" like the real thing are becoming increasingly common. Could these vegetarian alternatives replace ""traditional"" burgers and sausages?
Concerns about the environmental and health impact of our diets has seen interest in vegetarian and vegan foods grow. 
This has boosted everything from flexitarianism to vegan sausage rolls and campaigns like ""Veganuary"".   
While Quorn and Linda McCartney once ruled the meat substitute aisles of our supermarkets, new companies are appearing with a radically different vision of ""meat-free"". 
Vegetarian ""meat"" designed to mimic the look, smell and taste of the real thing are already available, while scientists are developing lab-grown meats 
But with the arrival of these new dishes comes an increasingly animated debate about what can be called ""meat"", as well as how - and even if - it should be sold.  
The first type of these new meat alternatives are plant-based products. 
These are already available in restaurants, pubs and supermarkets, contributing to a growing market worth an estimated £4.6bn. Last week, the value of US firm Beyond Meat rose to nearly $3.8bn (£2.9bn) after its Wall Street debut.
The aim of plant-based ""meat"" is for it to be so similar to cook and eat as the real thing, that it is virtually indistinguishable.  
It is made from plant proteins - usually wheat, pea or potato. Natural colourings like beetroot juice usually provide the ""blood"". 
Another US firm, Impossible Foods, has developed a plant version of heme - which gives beef its colour and taste.
The second type of meat alternative is known as cultured or clean meat, which is produced using animal stem cells. 
These cells are grown in a lab or bioreactor, usually with the help of a growth-enhancing substance taken from a calf foetus.
The process is arguably closer to a scientist growing replacement tissues and organs than the work of a cattle farmer. 
Although not yet available in shops and restaurants, the techniques are being explored in a number of countries and could be on our plates in a matter of years.
A firm called Just hopes to have its lab-grown chicken on US shelves by the end of 2019.  
These meat analogues are not aimed at vegetarians and vegans. 
There are high hopes that both the plant-based and lab-grown meats will appeal to hardened meat-eaters.
But getting these products on to our plates is not as straightforward as simply putting them into shops and restaurants.
Arguably, the biggest hurdle is getting permission to sell them. 
Cultured meat firms must undergo a rigorous safety assessment.
In the EU, this process can take up to two years. If the European Food Safety Authority decides the product is safe to eat, a decision must be made about whether it can go to market - and how it should be labelled.
In the US, the timeframe is less certain and relies on approval from two separate departments: the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the collection and culturing of animal cells, and the US Department of Agriculture, which decides how cultured meat can be marketed.
Even with approval from regulators, there is still the need to win over the public.
For many consumers, the so-called ""yuck"" factor of lab-grown meat could be too strong for it to be considered an alternative to real meat - or something they even want to eat.
For others, the most important thing may be clear and transparent information on what they are eating and from where it has come. 
In the US, there are demands for a more precise definition of ""meat"" before this new technology hits the shelves. 
The term should only be used to describe ""the tissue or flesh of animals that have been harvested in the traditional manner"", the US Cattlemen's Association argues.
For producers of meat alternatives, the outcome of these debates could make or break their businesses. 
It is thought that consumers are more likely to buy meat described as ""clean"" or ""slaughter-free"" than ""lab-grown"".
More like this
Naming is also important to the plant-based ""meats"", with opposition to the use of terms like ""burger"", ""steak"" or ""sausage"" to describe them growing.
The EU is to consider proposals to restrict these terms solely to describe edible animal products. It led to reports that this could mean veggie burgers and sausages might have to take on more descriptive names like ""discs"" and ""tubes"".
France has already chosen to ban the ""misleading"" labelling of vegetarian products, suggesting that labels including ""veggie burger"" and ""vegan bacon"" risk confusing people. 
Producers and investors in plant-based and cultured meat hope it will rival the taste, cost and convenience of conventional meat.
Some think it could take the place of our most environmentally-damaging meats and help meet climate targets.
Conventional meat production is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and a leading driver of environmental damage. A shift in diets has been described by scientists as critical to tackling climate change.
Plant-based ""meat"" produces significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires far less land and water. 
However, growing meat in a lab still requires lots of energy. A report from the Oxford Martin School suggested that in some circumstances - over the very long term, and not taking into account emissions from land-use change associated with livestock production - lab meat could result in more warming than meat from cattle.
Lab-grown meat is still only being produced in small quantities, meaning it is difficult to assess what large-scale production could look like.
Another issue is how a switch to meat alternatives would affect livestock farmers, some of whom argue that much of the land on which animals are farmed is not fertile enough for crop production. 
For consumers, there are important questions.
Are they willing to rethink the role of animal farming in diets and in our culture?
And if ""meat"" comes from plants or animal cells is it still meat at all?

The charcoal products, which are increasingly popular, often contain no fluoride to help protect the teeth.
And there is no scientific evidence to back up the claims they make, the authors say.
Excessive brushing with them can do more harm than good, they add.
They advise people to go to their dentist for advice on bleaching, or whitening, their teeth.
And they say it is better to stick to using a regular fluoride-based toothpaste.
Charcoal was first used for oral hygiene purposes in ancient Greece, as a way of removing stains from teeth and disguising unpleasant odours from diseased gums.
Dr Joseph Greenwall-Cohen, co-author of the study from the University of Manchester Dental School, said ""more and more shops are selling charcoal-based toothpastes and powders"", including Superdrug, Boots and Tesco, after celebrities had started talking about using them.
But he said the claims they made had been found to be unproven by a 2017 US review of 50 products.
Some said they were ""anti-bacterial"" or ""anti-fungal"", that they helped with ""tooth whitening"" and would ""reduce tooth decay"". 
The review said people were brushing regularly with the charcoal-based products in the hope that they would offer ""a low cost, quick-fix, tooth-whitening option"".
But too much brushing could lead to tooth wear and more sensitive teeth and, with few of the products containing fluoride or making the ingredient inactive, any protection from tooth decay was limited, it said.
""When used too often in people with fillings, it can get into them and become difficult to get out,"" Dr Greenwall-Cohen said.
""Charcoal particles can also get caught up in the gums and irritate them.""
He said charcoal toothpastes and powders were more abrasive than regular toothpastes, potentially posing a risk to the enamel and gums.
The charcoal contained in today's toothpastes is usually a fine powder form of treated charcoal, the review says.
Charcoal can be made from materials including nutshells, coconut husks, bamboo and peat, and possibly wood and coal.
Prof Damien Walmsley, from the British Dental Association, said: ""Charcoal-based toothpastes offer no silver bullets for anyone seeking a perfect smile, and come with real risks attached.  
""So don't believe the hype. Anyone concerned about staining or discoloured teeth that can't be shifted by a change in diet, or improvements to their oral hygiene, should see their dentist.""",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-48241663,"More than 40 US states have filed a lawsuit accusing pharmaceutical firms of conspiring to artificially inflate the cost of common medicinal drugs.
The lawsuit alleges that as many as 20 companies have been involved in fixing prices for over 100 drugs, including treatments for diabetes and cancer.
One of the firms accused is Teva Pharmaceuticals, the world's largest producer of generic medicine.
Teva, which has denied any wrongdoing, says it will defend its actions.
The legal action, which follows a five-year investigation, accuses drugs companies of involvement in a scheme to boost prices - in some cases by more than 1,000% - and was filed on Friday by Connecticut Attorney General William Tong.
""We have hard evidence that shows the generic drug industry perpetrated a multi-billion dollar fraud on the American people,"" Mr Tong said. 
""We have emails, text messages, telephone records and former company insiders that we believe will prove a multi-year conspiracy to fix prices and divide market share for huge numbers of generic drugs.""
A representative of Teva in the US said that the Israeli company ""has not engaged in any conduct that would lead to civil or criminal liability"", Reuters news agency reports. 
The other 19 firms implicated in the lawsuit have yet to comment on the allegations.
Fifteen individuals were also named as defendants accused of overseeing the price-fixing scheme on a day-to-day basis. 
According to the lawsuit, the drugs companies allegedly conspired to manipulate prices on dozens of medicines between July 2013 and January 2015.
It accuses Teva and others of ""embarking on one of the most egregious and damaging price-fixing conspiracies in the history of the United States"". 
Mr Tong said the investigation had exposed why the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs was so high in the US. 
America's healthcare system has been at the forefront of US politics for years. 
President Donald Trump has frequently promised to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, which was designed to make medical cover affordable for the many Americans who had been priced out of the market.
States have argued that eliminating Obamacare would harm millions of Americans who would struggle to meet the costs of medical care.",,,,

The poll of 4,500 UK adults found a third had felt anxious about their bodies, with one in eight experiencing suicidal thoughts.
The Mental Health Foundation, which commissioned the survey, said the issue could affect anyone at any age.
The charity wants advertising and social media firms to take more care with the way bodies are portrayed.
The issue of body image is one of the main theme's of this year's Mental Health Awareness week.
The charity is promoting a number of personal stories as part of its push to raise awareness about the issue.
They include one from Justyn Bravescar, 25, from Croydon, south London. 
He is a film-maker, blogger and mental health advocate, and has adopted Bravescar as his surname.  
As a toddler he accidentally poured a pan of boiling water over his body, resulting in severe burns all over the upper half of his body, including his neck. 
He was always very self-conscious about this and thought he would never find love or be at peace with himself. 
When he was older he started looking into reconstructive surgery, but says he had an epiphany when a skin camouflage tattoo artist told him that his scars were  beautiful. 
""As my scars were covered much of the time, it was very much an internal battle for me"" said Justyn. 
""I worried about my scarring and what people would think. It has only been in the last few years that I have really accepted them. They are part of me.""
He now has tattoos that highlight and celebrate his scarring.
Mental Health Foundation chief executive Mark Rowland said there needs to be greater awareness of the issue. 
""Our survey indicates that millions of adults in the UK are struggling with concerns about their body image. For some people this is potentially very severe.
""Women, and particularly young women, are showing the highest rates of distress. 
""Significant numbers have felt feelings of disgust and shame or changed their behaviour to avoid situations that make them reflect negatively about their bodies.""
But he warned it was not just young people who were affected - one in five people aged over 55 and over said they had felt anxious because of body image.
He also said more needed to be done by social media companies and the advertising industry to promote a diversity of body types. He said there needed to be clear ways to report abuse and bullying online - something the government is looking into.
""Many people identified social media as an important factor causing them to worry about their body image - and the majority of respondents felt the government needed to take more action,"" he added.",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-48205445,"The UK's National Health Service (NHS) will soon begin a major campaign to recruit health workers from other countries to meet growing staff shortages.
Reports suggest a strategy has been drawn up to target a number of countries around the world, including poorer nations outside Europe.
One estimate in March this year said the NHS will need 5,000 extra nurses every year - three times the figure it currently recruits annually.
But what about the countries that it will recruit from - what impact will it have on them?
The NHS already recruits globally to meet its staffing needs.
More than 12% of the workforce reported their nationality as not British, according to a report published last year.
The biggest group of foreign NHS workers are from the EU - 56 in every 1,000.
But the report noted the number of new staff coming from the EU is falling, and that this decline particularly applies to nurses.
In 2015-16, 19% of nurses who joined the NHS were from the EU. 
But by 2017-18, this had fallen to 7.9%.
The biggest group of doctors from outside Europe is from India. 
There are smaller numbers from Pakistan, Egypt and Nigeria.
 As for nurses, the biggest numbers are from the Philippines and India, with smaller numbers from EU countries such as Ireland, Spain and Portugal.  
The UK regulator for nursing, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), says the numbers from outside Europe registering for the first time surged by 126% in a year.
Between March 2017 and March 2018, there were 2,724 nationals from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who registered for the first time.
This number went up to 6,157 for the period March 2018 to March 2019.
In the UK, the NHS Employers organisation, which handles recruitment issues, has a list of countries which it has agreed not to target because of their economic condition and the state of their health systems.
It consists of those countries deemed eligible for aid from the OECD, the grouping which represents some of the world's wealthier nations. 
There are exceptions under country-to-country agreements which allow for recruitment, such as with the Philippines and some states in India.
Nevertheless, there are staff from other countries on this list who are working in the NHS.
NHS Employers told the BBC that individuals ""sometimes come to the UK independently on their own initiative without encouragement or support from the NHS.""
Some of the non-EU countries which have medical staff working in the UK face significant challenges with their own public healthcare systems. 
They spend far less than the UK spends on health as a percentage of GDP. 
World Health Organisation (WHO) data for 2015 shows that the UK had more than 27 doctors per 10,000 people, while Pakistan had fewer than 10, and India had under eight.
As for nurses, the UK in 2015 had more than than eight nurses and midwives for every 1,000 people, while the Philippines had 0.24.
Thousands of nurses leave the Philippines each year to work abroad -  nearly 15,000 were hired last year. 
The number coming to the UK is relatively small, but it has been growing since 2015, according to official data.
Healthcare managers in the Philippines have been warning of growing staff shortages as a result of emigration, media reports say.
But it's worth adding that some poorer countries whose medical staff work in the NHS, receive aid from the UK.
In 2016, both Pakistan and Nigeria were among the top five recipients of UK overseas aid.
Although much of this is spent on poverty reduction, some does go on projects to improve health infrastructure, including training health workers.
There are also projects to create better health education and awareness. 
Some experts believe there are benefits as well as drawbacks to the migration of health workers.
Staff who work abroad can learn valuable new skills, and contribute to their own country's economies through remittances.
In the Philippines, the provision of trained medical staff to other countries is an important industry.
And in India, there's now a thriving private sector producing doctors and nurses, who sometimes move to other parts of the country to work, as well as emigrating.
Global competition for trained medical staff is increasing.
As more countries become wealthier, their populations live for longer and start to suffer from the conditions associated with ageing.
The WHO estimates that by 2030, there will be a need for more than 18m extra health workers around the world.
And it says the worst shortages will be in the poorest countries, who have increasing populations, but whose skilled professionals are seeking better paid employment elsewhere.

About 150,000 pregnant women - one in five - carry group-B streptococcus. And if it is undiagnosed, there is a chance they could pass it to their baby.
Experts worry routine testing would see antibiotics given to many more women.
The trial will compare two tests with the current approach of testing only ""high risk"" pregnant women.
Each year in the UK there are between 400 to 500 babies born with GBS. 
Most will fully recover with treatment but GBS can lead to pneumonia, meningitis and a dangerous blood infection called sepsis.
GBS can be especially dangerous to babies who are born prematurely. 
Daisey-May Moore was born in 2018 with GBS that developed into blood poisoning and meningitis. 
Her mother, Bethany Foss, had never heard of GBS, even though Daisey-May was her third child. She had not been tested for the infection. 
Bethany, who is from Exeter, says: ""It was the worst time of our lives. 
""We were in total shock and disbelief as to how our baby could have been born so normal and perfect, then in the space of 24 hours be so near to death. 
""The whole experience has been highly traumatic. 
""Nobody should have to have discussions about their new baby's life when the infection they're suffering from could so easily have been prevented.""
Daisey-May is now being looked after by her parents at home but she has been left with severe brain damage. 
""We don't know yet how she will be affected in the future and what she will and won't be able to do,"" Bethany says. 
In 2017, independent experts said there was not enough proof a national screening programme would benefit mothers and babies.
The new study will measure the effectiveness of two tests:
Researcher Prof Jane Daniels, from Nottingham University, said: ""We want to answer the question for the NHS - should you test pregnant women for GBS or not, and if you're going to test, is it better to do a culture test at 35 to 37 weeks pregnancy or a bedside test? 
""Hopefully the trial will answer these questions. 
""We believe that, if testing is proved effective, this would mean that the right women get the right antibiotics.""
Jane Plumb, from the charity Group B Strep Support, said: ""The results of this important trial will drive improvements in UK policy and lead to fewer babies and their families suffering the trauma that group-B strep infection can bring.""",,,,

It's all part of a campaign to promote positive body image among women - specifically what's ""down there"".
Oliwia Bober, 23, is the artist behind the genitalia designs - and says feedback has been positive.
""Women are often shamed for how they look, especially the most private and delicate part - and that is just a really unpleasant experience,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.
""I think it's important to recognise that having a vulva or vagina isn't something that makes a woman, but for a lot of women that have them they're really important,"" says Oliwia.
Oliwia, who graduated from Brighton University last year, says she's felt the pressure too.
""Having seen porn, the vulva that has been normalised is a very specific type - and if you have anything that deviates from that the message is still ingrained that maybe something's not OK - which obviously isn't the case at all.""
The installations have been launched by Bodyform as part of its Viva La Vulva campaign.
Although she's drawing private parts in public spaces, Oliwia doesn't think there's anything offensive about her art.
""I don't think sexual organs, in and of themselves, should have positive or negative connotations attached to them as they are just that - organs. 
""It's the meaning that we assign to them that could be positive or negative.""
While it's common to see scribbles of penises in public toilets, it's not often that vaginas get the same attention.
Psychoanalyst David Morgan thinks there are so many penises because it ""represents anxieties about male sexuality"".
""It's dealt with by literally drawing their penises everywhere and shoving them in everyone's face.  
""When someone sees a penis on the wall, there's a slight shock and vulnerability - and through that action the person is reversing their own anxieties by projecting them on other people.""
Oliwia says she's got her own theory on that.
""In women's toilets, the sort of graffiti that features on the walls is usually quite empowering - or drunken confessions to other women.
""But I think part of the reason why it's usually penises that are visible is because people would have a hard time drawing a vulva from memory if they tried.
""I also think men are made to feel more proud than women, so maybe that's why.""

Flt Lt Nathan Jones is watching each of his leg muscles moving, on a big screen at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC), near Loughborough.
Since injuring his back on a flight to Afghanistan five years ago, he has had three operations to repair nerve damage and has only just started to walk without a stick again.
""For me to see what I'm doing is amazing,"" he says. 
""It shows which muscles are firing. 
""I'm amazed at how badly I was walking. 
""It feels brutal but it takes something like this to pinpoint where I'm going wrong. 
""In three months time, I will be able to see how I've improved."" 
The Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (Caren) machine is, put simply, is a big treadmill inside a mini-planetarium, surrounded by cameras.
The machine uses virtual reality technology to help a patient's balance, cognition and confidence in walking
It is a bit like a flight simulator but the team at the DMRC call it a ""functional rehabilitation simulator"". 
Once strapped in, the patient is surrounded by screens that can recreate any environment the medical staff want.  
So if they want to recreate walking up a cobbled street, it can happen. If they want to recreate a supermarket, they can.  
In the US, these machines aren't used for rehabilitation, they are used to prepare military personnel for deployment. A US marine can patrol a valley in Afghanistan without leaving their barracks.
DMRC clinical research manager Russ Coppack says: ""It is a fully immersive environment. 
""It allows us to place the patients in a real-world environment."" 
Next to the Caren machine, the 30m (100ft) biomechanic performance lab houses 32 3D motion-capture cameras and 10 high definition video cameras.
Equipment within the floor monitors muscle activity. 
It's the same technology used by Hollywood producers to make films such as Lord of the Rings and Planet of the Apes. 
And because the patient's body is covered in sensors, it allows the medical team to see which muscles are being used and whether more weight is being placed on one foot or the other.
Flt Lt Jones is using the equipment to improve his movement.  
""It shows exactly the position of your body,"" he says.  
""It's very hard to give yourself self-feedback, because you can't see. 
""Using apparatus like this, you get a full visual on it.
""It takes something like that to actually highlight and emphasise what your failings are.""

1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48214513,"Cuba has long been renowned for its medical diplomacy - thousands of its doctors work in healthcare missions around the world, earning the country billions of dollars in cash. But according to a new report, some of the doctors themselves say conditions can be nightmarish - controlled by minders, subject to a curfew and posted to extremely dangerous places, James Badcock reports.
For Dayli Coro, medicine was a calling.
""I studied medicine out of vocation. I used to sleep between three and four hours because I studied so hard. I worked hard in my first year of practice, I took on a lot of extra shifts. And now here I am. I cannot be a doctor in Cuba. It's very frustrating.""
Dayli, now 31 years old, wanted to be an intensive care specialist. She says that after graduating, she was told that if she went on a medical mission to Venezuela, she would gain experience in her chosen field and that it would count as her three years of obligatory social service, which all graduates have to complete in Cuba before gaining full-status posts.     
She agreed to join what Havana calls its ""internationalist missions"", following a path trodden by hundreds of thousands of Cuban doctors.  Since 1960, their medical work overseas has been held up by the communist government as a symbol of its solidarity with people all over the world. Fidel Castro described the medics as Cuba's ""army of white coats"".
As well as a source of great pride and prestige, it is also an economic lifeline for the regime. The scheme earns Cuba much-needed foreign currency.
With more than 30,000 Cuban doctors currently active in 67 countries - many in Latin America and Africa, but also European nations including Portugal and Italy - Cuba's authorities draw up strict rules in an attempt to prevent citizens defecting once abroad. 
The wages on offer were another strong incentive for Dayli, who is originally from the small Cuban city of Camagüey, to join up. Going from a doctor's salary on the island of just $15 a month in 2011, she says she was paid $125 monthly for the first six months in Venezuela, a figure that rose to $250 after six months and $325 during her third year. Her family in Cuba also received a bonus of $50 a month. 
According to a report by Prisoners Defenders, a Spain-based NGO that campaigns for human rights in Cuba and is linked to the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) opposition group, doctors on average receive between 10% and 25% of the salary paid by the host countries, with the rest being kept by Cuba's authorities.
Dayli says she voluntarily signed a contract for a three-year stint, but she neither had time to read it, nor was she given a personal copy.
In October 2011, the young doctor was posted to a clinic in the Venezuelan town of El Sombrero. The placement was part of the Barrio Adentro (Inside the Neighbourhood) scheme, which has distributed Cuban doctors around disadvantaged parts of the South American country since 2003 as a symbol of Cuban support for the regime of the late President Hugo Chávez and his successor, Nicolás Maduro. Venezuela pays for this and other services by Cuban workers with oil. 
Dayli says she found herself in a virtual war zone - one in which she became accustomed to having a gun pointed at her.
Venezuela was at that time in the midst of a crime rate spiral that has led to a murder rate of 92 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016, according to the NGO Venezuelan Observatory of Violence. World Bank figures put the 2016 figure at 56 per 100,000, topped only by El Salvador and Honduras. 
""There were many criminal gangs,"" says Dayli. ""When they fought, they brought their injured to us, because the local Venezuelan hospital had a police presence, and we didn't. These kids would bring in a patient with 12 or 15 bullets in his body, point their guns at you and say you had to save him. If he died, you would die. That kind of thing happened on a daily basis. It was routine.""
The gang members she treated were often just teenagers of 15 and 16, she says. 
""I had one with a bullet through the heart, another with five in the head. Some would be alive but you knew that if they were not operated on in 20 minutes, they would die, and we didn't have the necessary conditions. We didn't even have basic medicine to treat patients there. There were supposed to be four intensive care doctors, and normally there was only one on shift."" 
These patients would often be transferred by ambulance to a general hospital 45 minutes away. Sometimes the gang members would order Dayli to get in the ambulance with them, she says. 
""Once an ambulance was shot up by another gang and a Venezuelan doctor and the driver were killed,"" Dayli adds. ""There was always the possibility that the rival gang might try to finish off the patient during the transfer. I had a situation where a rival gang came in and shot the patient dead.
""I was 24, a tiny, skinny girl. But in a place where there is so much violence, you develop an incredible emotional coldness."" 
The medical missions came under the spotlight following decision to withdraw Cuban doctors from Brazil in the wake of President Jair Bolsonaro's election last year. Bolsonaro questioned the qualifications of the Cuban doctors in the country and described their contractual situation as ""slave labour"", pointing out that they only kept 25% of the pay with the rest going to the Cuban government. In response, Cuban authorities strongly rejected the characterisation and said it was ""not acceptable to question the dignity, professionalism and altruism"" of its international medical staff.
According to a report by the opposition-linked Cuban Prisoners Defenders, based on direct testimony from 46 doctors with experience of overseas medical missions, plus public-source information from statements by 64 other medics:
The BBC made repeated requests for a response from the Cuban government but received no reply. However,  After the Cuban Prisoners Defenders report was published, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel tweeted: ""Once again the empire's lies are trying to discredit Cuba's health cooperation programs with other countries, labelling them as ""modern slavery"" and ""human trafficking"" practices. They are upset about #Cuba's solidarity and example.""
Last December, he offered his support for ""the heroes of Cuban and Latin American medicine"" to mark Latin American Medicine Day. 
""To those who fight for life, it is all the same in a modest Cuban neighbourhood or a village in the Amazon. More than doctors, they are guardians of human virtue,"" Cuba's leader tweeted.
While Dayli at least managed to escape becoming a victim of violence in Venezuela, a compatriot and fellow woman medic was less fortunate. The 48-year-old family doctor wishes to be identified by the pseudonym ""Julia"" to spare her family knowledge of her ordeal.
During her five-year mission in Venezuela, Julia was stationed in Bolívar state. ""I was unfortunate in that the mission co-ordinator took a shine to me, and I didn't agree to his repulsive insinuations. He had me sent away to a series of out-of-the-way locations in rural areas.""
At one point, along with another Cuban woman doctor, she was posted to a shack with a clear plastic roof. One day when they saw a door had been forced open, they called the co-ordinator - but Julia says he did nothing.
Then, she says, ""I woke up one night, with someone holding my mouth shut. The doctor in the other room was screaming. There were two men in balaclavas, armed with guns."" Julia says she was raped by both men.
The mission co-ordinator came to take the two women away from this location, but, Julia says, he suffered no apparent consequences or official reprimand for having exposed members of his team to such danger. 
Julia was taken to Caracas where she was given anti-HIV medicine and sessions with a Cuban psychologist. ""Her treatment was not the best. The focus was basically 'Don't tell anyone this has happened.'"" 
While on a mission in Bolivia, Julia defected across the border into Chile, and now lives in Spain, where she has asked for asylum and works as a surgeon's assistant.
María (not her real name) is another female Cuban medic who says her gender made her a target. She was a 26-year-old family doctor when she was deployed to Guatemala on her first international mission in 2009. 
During her journey into the state of Alta Verapaz, the mission co-ordinator began telling her about a rich man in the area, whom he referred to as an ""engineer"". Maria says: ""He insinuated that he liked Cuban women."" She says she was given a mobile phone, on which the ""engineer"" began calling her every day. 
""I didn't answer, and I even changed the number, but still he called,"" Maria says. ""The co-ordinator told me I would be sent home as a punishment if I didn't got to see this man, and I said that was fine with me.
""My principles were on the line. I went with the idea of helping poor people on a mission for my country. It was so frustrating - I felt scared but could not run away."" María says that her passport was taken from her by her Cuban minders as soon as she arrived in Guatemala.   
After two months of resisting pressure to see the man, María was switched to another mission. Some months later she heard that the ""engineer"" had been arrested in an army raid, accused of being a drug trafficker. María completed two years in Guatemala, and later absconded from her next mission in Brazil by signing up to a US medical parole program, aimed at persuading Cuban doctors to defect. 
Dayli says she and her team in Venezuela had to meet weekly targets set by the Cuban mission leaders  related to the number of lives saved, patients admitted and treatments for certain conditions. 
She says she rejected what she considered unethical interference in honest medical care principles: ""That is where my problems began because I wasn't going to lie. If a patient is ready to go home and take medicine orally, I am not going to have them admitted for five days on a drip. I can't say how many heart attack patients I am going to have in a given week.""
According to the Prisoners Defenders report, more than half of 46 doctors with experience of overseas missions who were interviewed reported having to falsify statistics - inventing patients, patient visits and pathologies that did not exist. By exaggerating the missions' efficacy, the Cuban authorities can, the report says, demand greater levels of payment from the host country, or justify the enlargement of the operation. 
Dayli says the conflict she had with her senior medical colleagues at El Sombrero over the instructions to boost treatment statistics led to her being posted in lower-level destination in the calmer, more rural town of San José de Guaribe. But the twin pressures of working without sufficient medical equipment and orders to hit artificial or impossible targets remained.  
Once a woman arrived mid-labour, Dayli recalls, but the clinic did not have the right set of instruments for delivering a baby. Another time, she says she had to inset a tube into a patient by the light of her phone as there was no fuel for the generator.
She alleges her request to transfer a man with lung cancer to Caracas was denied so he would count towards her clinic's statistics. 
""The health of Venezuelans is not important to the mission,"" she says. ""I had an 11-year-old die in my arms when I was trying to put him on a breathing apparatus that was not working.""
Carlos Moisés Ávila tells a similar story. The 48-year-old doctor joined one of the first missions in Venezuela in 2004.
""We each had to report a life saved every day, so sometimes I had to grab someone who was healthy and stick them on a drip,"" Carlos says.
""Medicines arrived from Cuba out of date, so we had to destroy and bury them before including them in the inventory as used so they could be charged for. We would get our pay from soldiers, who were sometimes months late in coming, and would also take medicines from the hospital,"" recalls Carlos. 
Carlos says he signed up for the medical mission to improve his financial situation. Instead of getting around $20 a month in Cuba at that time, he started earning $300 in Brión, in Venezuela's Miranda province, although he says that the Cuban government was paid more than 10 times that amount for each doctor on the Barrio Adentro programme.
Dayli says that all fraternising with Venezuelans outside of work was prohibited. The Cuban doctors lived together and had to respect a 6pm curfew. The mission co-ordinator was a Cuban security service official. 
""He would ask you about your roommates in weekly interviews,"" Dayli says. ""He had network of paid local informers who would pass on any information about you in order to detect possible deserters. We weren't allowed to have a drink with a Venezuelan, or go to their house because you saved their life and to see how they're doing. If you fraternised with a dissident, you could have your mission revoked.""
Carlos says during the seven years he spent in Venezuela, he saw the way medicine was used as a political tool for propaganda purposes, sometimes at the expense of physicians' ethical code. 
""During the 2004 campaign for the recall referendum, we doctors were sent out door to door to give out gifts and medicines to boost support for President [Hugo] Chávez,"" he says. ""We also had lists of patients according to their political tendencies. Chávez regime supporters were put down as having hypertension, while opposition people were listed as diabetics. The former got better treatment, and any information we gathered on locals was passed on to the mission co-ordinator, a Cuban woman who controlled all of our personal relationships and who we were allowed to meet.""
A New York Times report in March quoted Cuban doctors stationed in Venezuela describing how they had worked to persuade patients to vote for the country's ruling Socialist Party, including by refusing treatment for opposition supporters and canvassing on doorsteps with gifts of medicine to bribe waverers. 
In response, the Cuban government denied the claims, saying that its ""honourable"" doctors had saved nearly 1.5m lives in Venezuela, as well as citing their participation in the fight against Ebola in Africa and cholera in Haiti, among other examples.   
Carlos also made the move from a Brazilian mission to the US, where he is now rebuilding his life in Houston, working as a medical assistant.
He is now unable to visit Cuba for fear of being imprisoned on the island for desertion. In 2018 he applied for a humanitarian visa to visit his mother who had cancer. It was denied, and he could not see her before she died. ""That's the way they play it, dangling permissions and gifts in front of you so people play ball. I soon realised our mission was more political than humanitarian.""
Dayli eventually came to a similar conclusion. 
She returned to Cuba in 2014 where she was posted to a hospital without an intensive care unit - a clear sign, she says, that she was out of favour. Later she was suspended from medical practice for alleged absences from work - an allegation she rejects. She says she began to be treated as a dissident, with a state security agent posted outside her house who followed her everywhere. Her family and friends were harassed. Eventually, she could take it no more and is currently visiting relatives in Spain, where she may decide to try and settle. 
""I wanted to be a doctor in Cuba but I have given that up now. I don't want to be a risk to my family. I spoke my mind and this is the consequence. They want soldiers, not doctors.""
Cuba has faced more than 50 years of US sanctions. Now, for the first time, a unique drug developed on the communist island is being tested in New York state. But some American cancer patients are already taking it - by defying the embargo and flying to Havana for treatment.

1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48256759,"Glucosamine supplements, better known as a remedy for joint pain, may lower a person's risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), research suggests. 
The findings in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) come from nearly half a million people in the UK. 
Almost one in five of the 466,039 participants said they took glucosamine. 
Users were less likely to develop heart and artery diseases or stroke, or die from these conditions. 
The results suggest a possible benefit, but more and longer studies are needed. 
It could be that users are generally more healthy, rather than glucosamine having a direct effect, experts caution. 
Glucosamine is a naturally occurring compound found in joint cartilage.
The body can make its own glucosamine, but supplements are sometimes used by people looking to relieve pain and symptoms of osteoarthritis and other joint disorders. 
Most glucosamine supplements are sold in pharmacies and health food shops in the UK as a ""food supplement"" and not a medicine. They are checked for food safety to ensure they won't do you any harm, but they are not checked for quality or quantity of the ""active"" ingredient. 
The active ingredient can be made synthetically or derived from the shells of shellfish. 
The evidence supporting the effectiveness of glucosamine for joint pain is mixed and very limited. Guidelines for the NHS do not recommend it for osteoarthritis. 
The new suggested link to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease needs more research. The BMJ study was observational - it can't establish cause. And it did not include detailed information on glucosamine dose or duration of use.
Glucosamine was associated with a 9%-22% lower risk of CVD death, coronary heart disease and stroke, compared to non-use over the 10 years of the study.  
The researchers believe the supplement may have an anti-inflammatory effect, which could explain the suggested benefit, but more investigations are needed.
Studies on the safety of glucosamine are limited. 
People with an allergy to shellfish should not take it, nor should women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 
Glucosamine should be avoided by people taking warfarin, as it may affect blood clotting. 
It may also decrease the effectiveness of some anti-cancer drugs, say experts. 
Like any supplement or medication, it can cause side-effects in some individuals. 
Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said: ""Only a trial can determine whether there is any truth to the lower observed risk. Observational studies can only ever generate new ideas to test.  
""Many other supplements have not proven benefits in trials even when observational data suggested there may be health benefits. Some supplements have even been shown to cause harm in trials. So, for now, I would not rush to buy glucosamine to lessen my heart risks when there are many other cost-effective proven ways to do so.""
Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, from the British Heart Foundation, said: ""One in four people in the UK still die from heart and circulatory disease. We urgently need to fund research that could result in improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment. 
""If a well-known and widely available supplement like glucosamine could help prevent heart and circulatory diseases, including heart attack and stroke, it is an avenue of research worth exploring.
""Meanwhile, an important way to reduce your risk is to maintain a healthy lifestyle and - when relevant - take medications as recommended to you by your doctor.""",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-48275795,"Alabama has become the latest US state to move to restrict abortions by passing a bill to outlaw the procedure in almost all cases. 
The law includes a ban on abortion in cases of rape or incest.
Supporters say they expect the law to be blocked in court but hope that the appeals process will bring it before the Supreme Court.
They want the court, which now has a conservative majority, to overturn the 1973 ruling legalising abortion.
Alabama's 35-seat Senate is dominated by men, and none of its four female senators backed the ban. It was then signed by Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey.
Sixteen other states are seeking to impose new restrictions on abortion.
Earlier this year the Supreme Court blocked implementation of new abortion restrictions in Louisiana. However the ruling was made by a narrow margin and the case is due to be reviewed later this year.
The bill's architects expect that it will be defeated in the lower courts, but hope that it will therefore eventually come before the Supreme Court.
They have been emboldened by the addition of two conservative justices nominated by President Donald Trump, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who give the nine-member court a conservative majority.
Their aim, they say, is for the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade ruling to be undermined or overturned completely.
Alabama's Lieutenant Governor Will Ainsworth said: ""Roe must be challenged, and I am proud that Alabama is leading the way.""
Eric Johnston, who founded the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition that helped draft the bill, told NPR: ""The dynamic has changed. 
""The judges have changed, a lot of changes over that time, and so I think we're at the point where we need to take a bigger and a bolder step.""
Under the bill, doctors face 10 years in prison for attempting to terminate a pregnancy and 99 years for carrying out the procedure.
A woman who has an abortion would not be held criminally liable, and abortion in cases where the mother's life is at serious risk are allowed.
The state Senate approved the law by 25 votes to six, rejecting exemptions for cases of rape or incest, with some noting all those voting for the bill were men.
by Ritu Prasad, BBC News, Alabama
Democrats here in Alabama knew they had no chance of stopping this controversial bill, but that only seemed to make the debate on the senate floor even more heated. Activists packed the senate gallery to watch the drama play out - reacting with laughter and gasps in turn. 
The few women who spoke on the floor were quick to highlight a key fact: this decision about women's bodies was being made almost entirely by men. 
As one female lawmaker introduced a sure-to-fail amendment to the bill to make it illegal for men to get vasectomies, the gallery and overflow watch room upstairs burst into laughter. 
On the senate floor, when the amendment failed, the lawmaker made her point, saying: We have never policed men's bodies the way we do women's. 
Just outside the stark white walls of the state legislature were still more pro-choice advocates, raising signs that called for women's equality, for protecting Planned Parenthood, for men to stay out of women's rights issues. 
One exasperated young woman told me: ""We've already had this vote about women before. In the 70s. Why are we here again now?""
Earlier this year the governors of four states - Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio - signed bills banning abortion if an embryonic heartbeat can be detected.
Opponents say this amounts to a ban on abortion because cardiac activity in an embryo can be detected as early as the sixth week, before a woman may be aware that she is pregnant.
The Guttmacher Institute, which campaigns for reproductive rights, says none of these bans are yet in effect, but their introduction is part of the same strategy to get the cases heard by the Supreme Court, it says.
Overall 28 states are currently considering legislation that would ban abortion in a variety of ways, it says.
Dr Yashica Robinson, who is one of the few doctors left providing abortion in Alabama, told BBC Radio Four's PM programme that she would continue to do her job while fighting for women's access to abortion in the state.
""I will still be here taking care of women and doing the things I can legally do,"" she said. ""Then, I will be helping women to the places they need to be in order to get the healthcare that they desire or need if they are going to make it difficult here.""
Alabama Democratic state Senator Bobby Singleton said the bill ""criminalises doctors"" and was an attempt by men ""to tell women what to do with their bodies"". 
Several Democratic presidential hopefuls also reacted on social media, including Kamala Harris.
The National Organization for Women called the ban ""unconstitutional"" and said it was ""a transparent effort to drum up political support for anti-abortion candidates in upcoming elections"".
Staci Fox of Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates called the decision ""a dark day for women in Alabama and across this country"".
In a statement she said Alabama politicians would ""forever live in infamy for this vote and we will make sure that every woman knows who to hold accountable"".
There are currently three abortion clinics in Alabama, down from more than 20 in the 1990s, according to pro-choice campaigners. 
Other states have seen similar falls in the number of abortion clinics and in 2017, six states reportedly had just one abortion clinic in operation. 
However states with liberal majorities are seeking safeguards to the right to abortion in their own constitutions.",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48290757,"The world's first drugs designed to stop cancer cells becoming resistant to treatment could be available within the next decade, scientists have said.
A £75m investment to develop the drugs has been announced by the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR).
Chief executive Prof Paul Workman said cancer's ability to adapt to drugs is the biggest challenge in treatment.
The new drugs could make cancer a ""manageable"" disease in the long term and ""more often curable"", he said.
Researchers say existing treatments such as chemotherapy sometimes fail because the deadliest cancer cells adapt and survive, causing the patient to relapse.
Prof Workman said: ""Cancer's ability to adapt, evolve and become drug resistant was the cause of the vast majority of deaths from the disease and the biggest challenge we face in overcoming it.""
He said the institute was ""changing the entire way we think about cancer"" to focus on anticipating the way cancer cells will evolve to prevent them from becoming resistant to drugs.
The ICR aims to attract a further £15m of funding for its new Centre for Drug Discovery at its campus in Sutton, south London, which is intended to bring together almost 300 scientists from different fields.
By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News
All cancers are constantly evolving and that is a major problem because patients relapse if their cancer develops resistance to therapy. 
The approach by the Institute of Cancer Research is to harness the process of evolution, to turn to the theories of Charles Darwin in the hunt for new therapies.
One idea is to develop drugs that limit a cancer's ability to evolve.
Another is ""evolutionary herding"" that guides a cancer's development into a state that makes it more vulnerable to drugs.
Or combinations of therapies could present an impossible hurdle for cancer to overcome.
Early-stage experiments using these ideas have had promising results, but any changes to the way patients are treated are at least a decade away.  
Scientists aim to use new approaches including multidrug combination treatments and artificial intelligence to predict and influence the evolution of cancer cells, creating weaknesses that treatments can exploit.
Dr Andrea Sottoriva, deputy director of cancer evolution in the new centre, said: ""Artificial intelligence and mathematical predictive methods have huge potential to get inside cancer's head and predict what it is going to do next and how it will respond to new treatments.""
Researchers are already working on new drugs designed to stop a type of protein molecule called Apobec, which is part of the immune system hijacked by more than half of cancer types to speed up the evolution of drug resistance.
Prof Workman said laboratory testing and clinical trials for the new drugs would take around 10 years before they could potentially become available for patients.
He added: ""We firmly believe that, with further research, we can find ways to make cancer a manageable disease in the long term and one that is more often curable, so patients can live longer and with a better quality of life.""",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48146166,"When Dani Donovan wanted to show her colleagues what life was like for her as someone diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), she never thought her sketches would lead to a series of web comics with a celebrity fan base.
The 28-year-old, who lives in Omaha, Nebraska, was diagnosed about a decade ago with ADHD and now hopes her comics will help others to understand the challenges for those with the condition.
She told the BBC: ""I'd just started a new job working in data visualisation, and it was the first time I was able to be really open about having ADHD and talk to my colleagues about what it's like. 
""We were telling stories and joking about how I always get off track while I'm telling stories, and I said that it's very much like having a sleepy train conductor running my train of thought. I had the idea for a flowchart, I posted it on Twitter and it took off immediately.""
Her graphic shows that when she hears non-ADHD storytelling, it involves a straight move from the start of a story to the end. Her storytelling, however, involves a pre-story prologue before moving to the start of the story, and then wandering through 'too many details', a side-story and losing her train of thought before reaching the end of the tale - and then apologising.
However, as with all things that hit the internet - once it's let loose, be careful of memes and amendments. 
Dani's diagram was re-versioned by an unknown person who split the flowcharts and created a meme with 'How a normal person tells a story' taking the place of the 'Non-ADHD Storytelling' heading Dani had given her first flowchart, and 'How I tell a story' replacing the 'ADHD Storytelling' heading for the meandering flowchart. 
The experience hit a chord and became a viral hit. Actress and writer Mindy Kaling even posted the meme stating ""I feel attacked"". 
Dani says she was a little bit disheartened when the storytelling version with the ADHD element stripped out exploded in the social sphere, as her watermark had been stripped off and the fonts had changed.
""When you're a graphic designer, it just hurts your heart - at least use a good font.
""I had also made a deliberate choice not to water down my images to try to appeal to lots of people, because I wanted people with ADHD to be heard."" 
She said as the image resonated so much, she decided to pull together many more.
""I wanted people to know that this is my experience, this is how ADHD affects me. I'm not saying that most people experience this, but it's been nice hearing from people who don't have ADHD but do relate to the pictures, as well as people who have it, or have loved ones who have been diagnosed.
""It's when they go 'Wow, this really helps me understand it a lot better' or 'Wow, I didn't know we had so much in common.' 
""I've had people reach out to me and message me to tell me that when they looked at the whole range of experiences in the series, they related to every single one and sought out a therapist. Some of them got diagnosed and are being treated.""
However, Dani is quick to stress that the images are not a diagnostic tool, and shouldn't be considered as such.
""If people ask me, 'Does this mean I have ADHD?' my answer is always going to be 'No, it definitely doesn't, but if you've read through the entire body of work and you feel every single thing hits home or if you are crying because you've got so many different experiences and haven't been understood, then you should think about speaking to a doctor or someone else.'
""Being able to have these open conversations, especially in the workplace, is one of the biggest areas where people can struggle. I'd like to be able to help with that.  I'd like my graphics to help people to understand their children a bit better too.""
Dani says one of her biggest fears was showcasing her images to the world: ""The larger the audience gets, the more criticism will happen. I was worried about people saying 'Everybody's like this, you know - don't blame it on your ADHD' or 'Everybody's a little ADHD and you're lazy or making excuses'.

Volunteers had every morsel of food they ate monitored for a month. 
And when given ultra-processed food, they ate 500 calories a day more than when they were given unprocessed meals.
The US National Institutes of Health said ultra-processed foods may be affecting hunger hormones in the body, leading people to keep eating.
There are scientific arguments about the definition of ultra-processed food but lead researcher Dr Kevin Hall said it was like ""pornography - it's hard to define but you know it when you see it"".
Warning signs include:
Twenty people gave up a month of their time to live in a laboratory. 
For a fortnight they were given either ultra-processed meals or unprocessed ones and then the diets were switched for the second half of the study. 
The participants were allowed to eat as much as they wanted and researchers closely monitored what passed their lips.
During their ultra-processed foods fortnight, the volunteers, on average, ate an extra 508 calories a day and put on 2lb (1kg).
Dr Hall, from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, told BBC News: ""This is the first study to demonstrate that there there is a causal relationship.
""Ultra-processed foods led to increases in calorie intake and in body weight and in fat. 
""It's suggestive that this may be playing a role in the larger population.""
Dr Hall said previous studies had estimated the ""obesity epidemic"" in the US was caused by people eating an extra 250-300 calories a day. 
The explanation is, for now, elusive. 
The human guinea pigs reported both meals were equally tasty, so a preference for ultra-processed was not to blame.
The nutritional content of the two diets was also carefully matched to ensure they had equal amounts of sugars, other carbohydrates, fats and fibre. 
One potential explanation is the impact of industrially processed foods on the hormones that alter the desire to eat. 
Dr Hall told BBC News: ""When people were consuming the unprocessed diet, one of the appetite-suppression hormones (called PYY) that has been shown in other studies to be related to restraining people's appetite actually went up despite the fact that they're now eating less calories.""
The study also showed the levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin went down on the unprocessed diet..
The study is on a limited number of people only and for a short period of time, so it is unclear if the findings apply more broadly.
Some people on the diet ate an extra 1,500 calories on the ultra-processed diet, while others ate roughly the same.
Dr Gunter Kuhnle, from the University of Reading, said processing food was often important ""for palatability, safety and preservation"".
He said: ""This is a well designed and well conducted study with interesting, although perhaps not surprising, outcomes.  
""It seems that participants found ultra-processed food more palatable, ate more quickly and consequently more - possibly because it took longer for them to feel full.
""A very interesting outcome of the study is the cost-per-energy: the ultra-processed diet was considerably cheaper than the unprocessed control diet, and this is likely to have implications from a public health point of view.""

Italian researchers believe the current voluntary programmes in countries like the UK will not be enough to curb outbreaks in the coming decades.
They said vaccination rates had fallen because of misleading campaigns claiming vaccinations are dangerous.
But others questioned whether compulsory vaccinations would help.
The researchers from the Bruno Kessler Foundation and Bocconi University raised concern about vaccination rates in a number of countries, including the US, Ireland and Australia, as well as in the UK. 
They have used computer modelling to predict how many measles cases could occur, the journal BMC Medicine reported.
It found that the number of cases in the UK could double in the coming decades, leading the researchers to call for compulsory vaccinations as has happened in Italy, where children need to be vaccinated to start primary school.
In England, the proportion of children receiving both doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab by their fifth birthday has fallen over the last four years to 87.2%.
This is below the 95% said by the World Health Organization to be the level necessary to protect a population from a disease.
The UK was declared free of the highly contagious measles disease for the first time by the WHO in 2017.
But in 2018, it experienced small outbreaks, and in March this year there was a sharp increase of cases across Greater Manchester.
Lead researcher Dr Stefano Merler said that the UK and other countries would ""strongly benefit"" from compulsory vaccinations as it would help them reach herd immunity.
But Prof Adam Finn, of the University of Bristol, said there was no proof of this. 
""Mandatory immunisation is certainly one way to try and increase coverage but it's far from clear how well it works or whether it would work at all in many places.  
""If the reasons that the vaccine is not getting into the children relate to easy access, vaccine supply or clarity of information available to parents, then making it compulsory will do nothing to alleviate such obstacles.  
""If there is widespread mistrust of authority or of the motivation behind any such requirements, it could actually make things worse.""
Earlier this year, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that he was willing to look at ""all options"" to boost England's vaccination levels, including compulsory immunisation.
Mr Hancock said he did not want to ""reach the point"" of imposing jabs, but would ""rule nothing out"".
In March, the head of NHS England warned ""vaccination deniers"" were gaining traction on social media.",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48297137,"More young people under 50 are being diagnosed with bowel cancer, two studies of the disease in European and high-income countries have found.
Although total numbers of cases in young people remain low, the studies highlighted a sharp rise in rates in 20 to 29-year-olds.
Researchers are not clear why this is happening, but say obesity and poor diet could be factors.
Experts urged doctors not to ignore symptoms in young people.
In most of Europe, bowel cancer screening programmes start at the age of 50 because cases of the disease are much higher among this older age group.
As a result, countries with established programmes, like the UK, have seen bowel cancer rates in the over-50s fall.
But recent research suggests rates are now rising more steeply among under-50s - and there have been calls for screening to start at 45 instead, in the US particularly.
In a study in the journal Gut, Dutch researchers analysed trends in 20 European countries, including the UK, Germany, Sweden and France, using data from more than 143 million people.
They found a rise in cases of bowel cancer between 1990 and 2016 in most countries - with the most significant increase among people in their 20s.
For them, bowel cancer incidence increased from 0.8 to 2.3 cases per 100,000 people over 26 years - with the sharpest rise in rates, of 7.9% per year, occurring between 2004 and 2016.
But there was no increase in deaths from bowel cancer for this age group, the study found.
Among people in their 30s, rates of bowel cancer also rose - but less steeply - and among 40-somethings rates fluctuated.
The researchers, from the Erasmus MC University Medical Center in Rotterdam, said if the trend continued, screening guidelines may need to be reconsidered.
Another study, in the Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology, appeared to confirm the trend among young adults in high-income countries, including the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
It found a 1.8% increase in colon cancer cases and 1.4% rise in rectal cancer cases in people under 50 in the UK between 1995 and 2014 .
Over the same period, there were decreases in bowel cancer cases of 1.2% in the over-50s.
The findings were similar in many of the countries studied.  
Dr Marzieh Araghi, lead study author from International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, said the findings highlighted the need for action. 
""While population-based screening in people under 50 years old is not considered to be cost-effective due to relatively low incidence numbers, family history could help to identify younger people at high risk of genetic susceptibility to colorectal cancer, for further assessment,"" she said. 
Dr Araghi added that more studies were needed ""to establish the root causes of this rising incidence to enable the development of effective preventive and early-detection strategies"".
Andrew Beggs, consultant colorectal surgeon from the University of Birmingham, said rising rates of bowel cancer among young patients ""must be urgently investigated"".
""This means the age at which bowel cancer screening needs to start may have to change to screen people at a younger age, and people under the age of 50 with any 'red flag' symptoms (bleeding, a change in bowel habit, weight loss or tummy pain) should get it checked out as soon as possible,"" he said.
Source: NHS UK
Dr Marco Gerlinger, from the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said he had noticed increasing numbers of young patients with bowel cancer for some time.
""These large and high-quality studies provide solid data to support this trend,"" he said.
And he added: ""These results are a call to action to raise awareness among staff in GP practices and hospitals to consider bowel cancer as a diagnosis when young people come to them with pain, changes in bowel habits or blood in their stool.
""The new studies show a clear need to dedicate more efforts to understanding the lifestyle factors that trigger bowel cancers in young people and to rethink how screening may need to be adjusted to prevent such devastating cancers.""",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48253477,"In a UK first, doctors have used keyhole surgery to successfully repair the spine of a baby with spina bifida while it was still inside the womb.
Surgeons at King's College Hospital say the procedure is not a cure, but could be the difference between some children learning to walk or not. 
Sherrie Sharp and her son Jaxson had the operation 27 weeks into the pregnancy. 
Spina bifida was diagnosed after the routine 20-week pregnancy scans. 
They showed Jaxson's spine and spinal cord were not forming correctly. 
Gaps in the developing spine meant the cord was bulging out of his back and was left exposed to the amniotic fluid in the womb.
This damages the crucial nerves in the spinal cord and could lead to paralysis, a loss of sensation in the legs and problems controlling the bladder and bowels.  
The longer the spinal cord is left exposed, the greater the damage.
Sherrie, 29, and from West Sussex, said the news was a shock, but an abortion was a ""definite no"".
She decided to have pioneering surgery to correct the defect, although there was the risk of the baby arriving prematurely. 
Sherrie told the BBC: ""I wanted to do the best for my baby, I wanted him to have a better life and there's nothing wrong with that.""
Doctors sedated Sherrie, and the anaesthetic also crossed the placenta to prevent Jaxson, who was still a tiny foetus at this point, from wriggling.
Surgeons made three small incisions in Sherrie's bump and then a thin camera and small surgical tools were inserted into her womb.
Then, during a three-hour operation, surgeons put the exposed spinal cord back in place and used a patch to cover Jaxson's spinal cord.  
Dr Marta Santorum-Perez, a consultant at the Fetal Medicine Unit at King's, told the BBC: ""We are operating on very delicate structures - the foetus's nerves.
""The foetus is very small and inside the womb, so obviously it's a very delicate operation.""
Until recently, parents had to wait until a child was born for corrective surgery or find treatment abroad.
But the evidence suggests that operating during the second trimester reduces nerve damage and the long-term health consequences of spina bifida.
At the end of last year, the first in-womb surgery for spina bifida took place in the UK. It involved invasive surgery of opening the mother's abdomen and uterus to perform the operation.
Mr Bassel Zebian, a consultant neurosurgeon at King's, said the keyhole approach was better for the mother and reduced the risk of the uterus rupturing in subsequent pregnancies.
He said that operating in the womb also reduced the risk of complications later in life, but could not remove them entirely. 
He told the BBC: ""It's quite important, because improving the function of the lower limbs may be the difference between someone walking and someone not walking later in life.
""So a significant improvement in a significant number of patients, but not a cure.""
Baby Jaxson arrived early, at 33 weeks, and was looked after in neonatal intensive care at King's.
But Sherrie hopes the operation has given Jaxson the best start in life.
She said: ""He's got movements in his legs, we were told he'd have minimal movements if we didn't have the surgery and he wouldn't be able to move at all.
""I've got high hopes for him, from day one he's done things, he's amazed us all.
""He makes me proud every day, he's just a miracle.""

1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48258910,"The menopause is when women's periods stop and they can no longer become pregnant naturally - but what else happens to the body, and why?
Menopause is a natural part of ageing which normally happens between the ages of 45 and 55, but can also be brought on by surgery to remove the ovaries or the womb (hysterectomy).
In the UK, the average age of menopause is 51.
Hormones, specifically one called oestrogen.
It is crucial to the whole monthly reproductive cycle - the development and release of an egg from the ovaries each month for fertilisation and the thickening of the lining of the womb ready to accept the fertilised egg.
But as women age and their store of eggs declines, ovulation, periods and pregnancies stop.
And the body gradually stops producing oestrogen, which controls the whole process.
This doesn't happen overnight though. 
It can take several years for this crucial hormone to fall to low levels - and then it stays that way.
Massive ones.
The brain, skin, muscles and emotions are all affected by falling levels of oestrogen.
The body can start to behave very differently and many women experience symptoms long before their periods actually stop - during what is called the peri-menopause.
Hot flushes, night sweats, sleep problems, anxiety, low mood and loss of interest in sex are common.
Bladder problems and vaginal dryness are also normal during this time.
When oestrogen production stops altogether, there is a long-term effect on the bones and heart. Bones can weaken, making fractures more likely, and women can become more vulnerable to heart disease and stroke.
That's why women are offered hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, which boosts oestrogen levels and helps to relieve symptoms.
But not all women experience symptoms. They can also vary in their severity and how long they last - from a few months to several years.
A lack of oestrogen. It is involved in the workings of the body's thermostat in the brain.
Normally, the body copes well with temperature changes, but when oestrogen is lacking, the thermostat goes wonky and the brain thinks the body is overheating when it's not.
Yes, it can do.  
The hormone interacts with chemicals in brain receptors which control mood, and at low levels it can cause anxiety and low mood.
A lack of oestrogen can also affect the skin, making it feel dry or as if insects are crawling under the skin.
Yes, progesterone and testosterone - but they don't have the same impact as low levels of oestrogen.
Progesterone helps to prepare the body for pregnancy every month, and it declines when periods stop.
Testosterone, which women produce in low levels, has been linked to sex drive and energy levels.
It declines from the 30s onwards, and small numbers of women need it topped up.
It is possible to take a blood test to measure levels of a hormone called FSH (follicle-stimulating hormones) but it's not very accurate, particularly over the age of 45.
Experts say hormone levels go up and down all the time, even during the course of a day, so the test can't really pin down what's going on.
A better way is to talk to a GP or nurse about the pattern of your periods and any symptoms you are experiencing.
Knowing what symptoms to look out for is important - feeling low and irritable needs to be recognised as much as hot flushes and night sweats. 
A change in periods - becoming more heavy or more irregular - is one of the first signs of the menopause approaching.
Until you are period-free for a year, you won't know you've actually gone through the menopause.
Well, oestrogen levels in the body don't recover after the menopause.
With rising life expectancy, women are now living more than a third of their lives with oestrogen deficiency.
But there is no reason to be cowed, says Dr Heather Currie, gynaecologist, menopause expert and past chairwoman of the British Menopause Society.
""Women are continuing to work later in life, they still look amazing - the image of the menopause is changing.""
Her advice: ""If you're affected, go and visit your GP surgery armed with information.
""Women should know what symptoms to look out for.""
She says there is plenty of support and information to help women cope with the physical and emotional changes which the menopause brings.
Hormone replacement therapy is seen as the most effective treatment available for menopausal symptoms.
There has been debate over its long-term safety, and it can cause some side-effects, but it has been shown that ""the benefits of HRT outweigh the risks"", Dr Currie says.
Talking to other women going through the menopause and experiencing the same symptoms is also a real help, she adds.
And the menopause is another good reason for women to lead a healthy lifestyle by: 
Doing these things will help to reduce the effects of the menopause on the body.",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48268110,"The cycle of sleep and wakefulness is one of the key human behaviours.
We spend about a third of our lives asleep and cannot survive without it. 
When asleep, our brain memorises and processes information. Our body clears toxins and repairs itself, allowing us to function properly when awake.
Even short-term sleep deprivation significantly affects our wellbeing. Most of us begin to fall apart after just one night without sleep and after three nights of missed sleep, we are functioning way below par. 
One study suggested that after 17-19 hours of staying awake, performance on cognitive tasks may be similar to having had too much to drink.
These effects worsen over time. The longest documented period without sleep of just more than 11 days prompted serious cognitive and behavioural changes, problems with concentration and short term memory, paranoia and hallucinations. 
But while scientists have long understood the importance of getting enough sleep, the key part played by light exposure can sometimes be overlooked.
The reason light is so important is that it sets our circadian rhythm, or body clock, via specialised light sensors within the eye. 
Our eye detects the light and dark cycle within our environment and adjusts the body's circadian rhythm so that the internal and external day coincide.  
This is so powerful that that people who have very severe eye damage can find their body clock is thrown off, leading to sleep problems. 
Without any access to light, the human body clock appears to drift, adding about half an hour on to its 24 hour cycle for each day of darkness.
Jetlag is the most obvious example of the effect light can have. Exposure to light in the new time zone helps reset our body clock to local time, telling us the right time to sleep. 
In 1800, most people across the world worked outside and were exposed to the change from day to night.
Today, many of us miss out on these environmental cues as we work inside. Agriculture and fishing, for example, now make up just 1% of jobs in the UK. 
We have become a light deprived species, and this has far reaching consequences for the quality of our sleep, and consequently our wellbeing. The optimum amount varies from person to person, but we do know that our bodies need exposure to very bright light that the majority of indoor lighting does not provide. 
One notable side effect is Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a form of depression thought to affect 2-8% of Europeans, which is linked to lack of sunlight exposure.
And there are many other areas where lack of natural light has caused problems.
While many of us aren't getting enough natural light, for nightshift workers it is a particular issue.
They have to work at a time when the body clock has prepared the body for sleep, and alertness and performance ability are low. They may try to make up on sleep during the day, but it will usually be shorter and of poorer quality. 
In effect, they work when they are sleepy and sleep when they are not, and the negative health effects of this are only just being fully realised.
In the short term, it can prompt abnormal emotional responses and an inability to process information correctly. 
Over the long term, many aspects of health can be affected by nightshift working, which may shorten life spans by up to six years.
As many as 97% of nightshift workers fail to adapt to the demands of their work pattern, regardless of how many years they have been doing the job. 
More like this
They are unable to shift their biology because the artificial light found in an office or factory is very dim compared to environmental light; by noon on a sunny day, natural light can be 250 times brighter than the light in an office. 
When a night shift worker leaves to go home they are often exposed to this bright natural light, sending signals to their internal timing system that it is time to wake up.
In a Harvard study, night shift workers became completely nocturnal after being exposed to bright light in the workplace and then totally shielded from natural light during the day. But this is not a practical solution for most people.
Nursing home residents also often suffer from lack of sunlight.
Indoor light can be dim while residents often experience very little natural light, meaning poor quality sleep is a common complaint.
A Dutch study increased the light in the communal areas of a nursing home, while attempting to make bedrooms as dark as possible. 
This appeared to reduce daytime napping and stabilise night-time sleep, which improved mental ability and sense of wellbeing. 
Light deprivation is not just about the loss of bright natural light; it is also about the timing of light exposure. 
Dusk light delays our body clock, making us get up later the next day. Morning light advances the clock, which makes us get up earlier. 
When we worked outside this was not a problem; we were exposed to both dawn and dusk and so the two cancelled each other out. 
But today many of us only experience part of the dawn-dusk cycle. This can be particularly true for university students, who tend to start the day later, and then spend more time outside in the early evening. 
The dusk light delays their body clocks, meaning they are likely to get up and go to bed later. This is compounded by hormonal changes in adolescence and early adulthood which delay the body clock by about two hours.
The health consequences of smoking, alcohol and unprotected sex are well publicised, but the importance of sleep and the critical role played by light is arguably less well known. 
Further research and greater awareness in this area could help individuals to make informed choices about prioritising their own sleep and getting enough sunlight. It could also influence the way that policies are developed by governments, educational institutions and workplaces.
Minimising light exposure before you go to bed, and trying to get us much morning light as possible, are simple steps that could help most people to regulate and improve their sleep.

Royal College of Nursing general secretary Dame Donna Kinnair will call for safe staffing levels to be enshrined in law in a speech on Monday. 
There are currently nearly 40,000 nurse vacancies - one in nine posts.
However, the government says it is committed to increasing the number of nurses in training. 
But Dame Donna, in an address to the RCN's annual conference in Liverpool, will say this is not enough.
A report earlier this year by three leading think tanks warned vacancies could rise to 70,000 within five years and 100,000 in 10 if action was not taken.
Dame Donna will say the situation has been made worse by the removal of a student bursary for trainees and the introduction of tuition fees in 2016. 
She will also say the good will of nurses is being abused - and that ministers need to consider the financial and human cost of leaving jobs unfilled. 
She will demand tougher rules on safe staffing be introducing, criticising the ""vague metric"" currently used which does not distinguish between care provided by registered nurses or healthcare assistants.
Dame Donna will point to the new staffing law in Scotland, which cleared its final parliamentary hurdle earlier this month, as evidence of how legislation can be introduced. 
Scotland is now the second country in the UK to set staffing accountability in law after Wales became the first in Europe to legislate in 2016.
She will say: ""We will not stop until people are held to account for the desperate shortages each and every one of us has witnessed. Politicians must stop short-changing the public. 
""They must stop the rot and put an end to the workforce crisis in nursing.
""Rather than only looking at the cost of educating and employing nurses, the government must think about the true cost - financial and human - of not doing it. 
'Employers, decision-makers and ministers with the power to change things should not let individual nurses take the blame for systemic failings.
""The goodwill of nursing staff is being abused and politicians must know it is running out. I will not stand by while this profession is denigrated.""
The Department of Health and Social Care has already announced plans to increase training places by 25% - and the NHS in England is now working on a long-term plan for the workforce.

1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-48307272,"Doctors have begun switching off the life support of a quadriplegic man whose case has been central to the right-to-die debate in France. 
Vincent Lambert, 42, has been in a vegetative state since a motorcycle accident in 2008.
His care has divided both the country and his own family.
His wife has long called for his feeding tubes to be withdrawn, while his parents insist his life should continue.  
Doctors at the Sebastopol Hospital in the northern French city of Reims said the action on Monday followed a final judicial ruling to end the nutrition and hydration he receives.
Family members confirmed that the systems were being switched off. 
His parents' lawyer, Jean Paillot, called the move ""shameful"".
The case has been the subject of judicial rulings, going as far as the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).
Europe's top court upheld the decision of a French court to allow Mr Lambert to be taken off life support. However, doctors then did not carry out the plan - amid security concerns raised by Vincent Lambert's father, who feared there was a plan to kidnap him.
A new medical team are now moving forward with withdrawing his care, as further appeals have been dismissed. 
But not everyone agrees with the decision. 
The high-profile case has proved extremely divisive in France, where euthanasia is illegal but doctors are allowed to put terminally ill patients into deep sedation.
Mr Lambert is a former psychiatric nurse who has been in a quadriplegic state of paralysis, with minimal consciousness, since his accident. 
He has been kept alive with food and water delivered through a gastric tube. He can breathe without artificial aid and occasionally opens his eyes.
After several years of trying to improve his condition, Mr Lambert's medical team recommended in 2013 that care should stop, in consultation with his wife Rachel.
Because the rest of his family were not consulted, the decision was challenged and the lengthy legal battle over his care began. 
His wife, six of his siblings and his nephew favour artificial life-support being ended - but his devoutly Roman Catholic parents, Pierre and Viviane, and two other siblings have remained adamant it should continue.
At the height of the row, in 2015, Mr Lambert's parents released a video via a conservative Catholic website on YouTube which they said showed him reacting to family members.
Doctors involved in his care complained that the video was misleading about his condition and manipulative to the wider public.
The UN's Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities had called on France to intervene and delay the move to withdraw the life support while they investigate his case further. 
However, France's ministry of health has said it is not bound by the committee. 
""All legal appeals have been exhausted and all judicial bodies, both national and European, confirm that the medical team in charge of his case has the right to withhold care,"" said Minister Agnès Buzyn.
The European Court of Human Rights said it rejected a further request on Monday by Mr Lambert's parents and siblings for the UN committee's calls to be observed. 
The court said they ""had submitted no new evidence such as to induce it to change its position"" on the matter.
Mr Lambert's parents have also appealed to France's defender of rights to intervene but the commissioner said it was not a matter he could resolve.
In an open letter published over the weekend, they asked President Emmanuel Macron for help. 
""Mr President, Vincent Lambert will die without hydration in the week of 20 May if you do nothing and you are the last and only one able to intervene,"" read the letter, signed by lawyers for family members opposed to ending the life support.

Then living in Arizona, the teenager went from top of her class to having to drop out altogether.
For a girl who had grown up with travel magazines plastered over her bedroom walls with ambitions of eventually becoming a doctor, the deterioration was devastating.
""I lost all semblance of what made me 'me',"" Hailey says. ""I went from being strong and independent to totally dependent on my parents for daily tasks - my mom quit her job to help me full time.""
It had started like a normal virus back in the Autumn of 2013, but the symptoms didn't go away.
""I was throwing up every day for a few weeks,"" Hailey says. ""Then the neurological symptoms started.""
Every few minutes, Hailey began to experience what felt like an intense shiver down her spine. Within a week or two, it happened every few seconds.
""Soon after I began to tremor constantly - mostly in the head and neck, like I was shaking saying 'no' all the time,"" Hailey says.
She recalls a day when she tried to go to school, fighting against the tremors to sit still at her school desk.
""I felt like I could feel everyone staring at me because I had these uncontrollable movements and I just ran out there and cried,"" she recalls.
""There were the physical elements, but there was also the mental element of being a teenage girl and just not wanting anyone to see me like that.""
The emotional toll left her feeling isolated from her peers and friends - and the physical effects kept getting worse. 
""I started to have spasms in my diaphragm that would make me gasp and have the hiccups constantly... By March, I began to stutter as I had lost control of the muscles for speech,"" Hailey says.
The spasms left her disorientated and caused intense muscle pain in her head and neck. 
Paediatricians who specialise in movement disorders are hard to come by, and the doctors she visited couldn't work out what was going on.
Some, she says, even started to suggest her symptoms may have been psychosomatic. 
""Being a teenage girl, a few doctors were quick to write me off as potentially psychiatric or even attention seeking,"" she recalls.
As a last resort, her mum decided to take her 1,600 (2,500km) miles across the country to the specialist Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.
The first test they did, measuring electrical impulses in her body, established straight away that the movements were involuntary. Then a contrast MRI screening eventually showed their cause.
Hailey had a Chiari malformation - an anatomical condition where her skull shape forces the lower part of the cerebellum (the part of the brain that controls balance) to extend down into the space where the spinal cord passes through.
The condition comes in several forms. The one that Hailey had only develops in adolescence when the skull and brain are still growing. Type II and III are congenital, or present at birth.
Dorothy Pope, director of the Chiari and Syringomyelia Foundation, says about three million people in the US are thought to have the condition. 
Symptoms, severity and treatments vary in each case - some people may find it debilitating, while others may not realise they have it all.  
""More and more cases are being diagnosed because MRI is more accessible today,"" she told the BBC.
Straight away, a neurologist prescribed her a fairly common medicine to help the symptoms.  
The improvement was gradual, but within two months her tremors had resolved so that they were no longer visible.

""It was sadly comical that such a complex situation, so difficult to diagnose, could be treated by something so simple all along,"" she says.
As the symptoms eased, Hailey threw herself back into education and enrolled in the University of Arizona, but the transition was tough. On top of the time in school she had missed, she felt isolated socially from her peers.
""It was so difficult to transition from being 'sick' person to a normal girl again,"" Hailey says.
""While all my friends had spent the last year applying to colleges and planning their futures, I had written off all hopes for my dreams and wasn't prepared for anything."" 
She found the first semester back in education isolating and struggled to keep up with her plans to study medicine. Feeling restless with her new-found freedom, she decided to apply for a ""long-shot"" scholarship to go to India and study Hindi.
Despite the odds, Hailey got a place. Her family felt apprehensive about the ambitious travel plan, but ultimately supportive of her decision. 
""Everyone thought I was crazy to travel abroad after everything that happened but I wanted to be true to myself and not let my condition change who I had always been,"" she says. 
That first trip became a catalyst for her love of the country. She switched major to global health and continued learning the language - returning for a year abroad in 2016.
Then after graduation she got a Fulbright scholarship to move to Mumbai for her research. Age 22, she lives in India and works for an organisation, Yuvaa, who spotlight youth mental health.
The group, who have UN sponsorship. are travelling around the country running workshops and Hailey is filming a documentary about their work.
It's a far cry from where she was a couple of years ago, when she couldn't even hold a camera. 
""I didn't become a doctor,"" Hailey says. ""But I became a person who listens to young people, especially young girls, and takes them seriously. 
""Through the documentary I want to raise their voices and concerns to a platform from which people, maybe even doctors and policy makers, can learn about their struggles and recognise them.""",,,,

Chloe Phippard's five-month-old daughter Ava will take a daily dose of insulin powder to see if it can prevent children developing the condition.
The trial will explore if the immune system can be trained to tolerate the body's own insulin to prevent onset of type 1 diabetes. 
Mrs Phippard said the trial ""could give her a chance at living a normal life"".
Type 1 diabetes means the body stops producing insulin, causing glucose levels in the blood to become too high. 
It can be life-threatening and even with treatment can lead to blindness, cardiovascular disease and strokes.
A linked study found Ava had a genetic risk of the condition, which her five-year-old sister Amelia was diagnosed with aged two.
""I cried when I found out about the risk because I knew what Amelia had gone through and I didn't want Ava to go through that as well,"" said Mrs Phippard, from Milton Keynes.
Amelia's diagnosis came as a shock to Mrs Phippard, 24, and her husband Carl, 28, as they had no family history of diabetes.
She now has insulin administered through a wearable device and a tube placed under her skin.
""She's never going to live a life without diabetes and it's all she's ever known,"" said Mrs Phippard.
The Primary Oral Insulin Trial hopes to sign up 100 babies at increased risk in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Milton Keynes and Oxfordshire to take part in the trial.
Participants will be given an insulin powder or placebo until the age of three, and will be monitored for six years.
About 1% of children have genes which put them at high risk, meaning they have a greater than 10% chance of developing type 1 diabetes.
In the UK, the study is being led by the University of Oxford, with support from the National Institute for Health Research.
There are two main types of diabetes:
Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. 
About 10% of all diabetes is type 1, but it is the most common type of childhood diabetes, so it is sometimes called juvenile diabetes or early onset diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes tends to develop later in life and is linked to lifestyle and being overweight.

Research for the Children's Commissioner for England found children were often unable to get appropriate support at school and in the community.
This was contributing to children ending up in institutions, sometimes for months or years, the report found. 
Children with learning disabilities or autism were being particularly let down by the system, it added.
Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield's report says successive governments have tried to tackle the problem, but the number of children in mental health hospitals remains ""unacceptably high"".
Research shows a clear need to ""focus on children's journeys before they are admitted into inpatient care"", the report says, but often this is not happening. 
""Children, families and staff working in this area spoke again and again about how the failure to provide appropriate support to children when they are in school and living in the community, and particularly when they reach a crisis point, has contributed to inappropriate hospital admissions and delayed discharges,"" it says.
The review says there were 250 children identified as having a learning disability or autism in mental health hospitals in England in February 2019, compared with 110 in March 2015.
According to the report, NHS England said the figure of 110 was due to under-identification of these children in the past.
But even using adjusted figures from NHS England, the number has still not come down in the last four years, the report says.
It says it is ""particularly concerning"" that these findings come after NHS England's Transforming Care programme, which sought to improve the quality of care for people with a learning disability or autism. 
Ms Longfield said: ""They are some of the most vulnerable children of all, with very complex needs, growing up in institutions usually far away from their family home.
""For many of them this is a frightening and overwhelming experience. For many of their families it is a nightmare.""
Ms Longfield said she had spoken to parents whose children had been ""locked away in a series of rooms for months"".
""Others have to listen as they are told by institutions that their child has had to be restrained or forcibly injected with sedatives,"" she said.
""They feel powerless and, frankly, at their wits' end as to what to do.""
Ms Longfield is calling for a national strategy to ""address the values and culture of the wider system across the NHS, education and local government so that a failure to provide earlier help is unacceptable, and admission to hospital or a residential special school is no longer seen as almost inevitable for some children"".
A spokesman for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said some of the most vulnerable children were being ""horribly failed"".
He said: ""No child should be left to languish alone and it's important that the government takes urgent action to provide high quality, community-based care that can prevent the need for children to be placed in secure hospitals.""
Improving child mental health 'years off'
Children 'must be suicidal to get help'
Tim Nicholls, head of policy at the National Autistic Society, said autistic children and adults were ""being failed by a broken system"".
Wherever possible, autistic people should get the mental health support they need in their own community, he added. 
The government said it was determined to reduce the number of people with autism or learning disabilities who are in mental health hospitals. 
A spokeswoman said: ""The NHS is committed to reducing numbers of people with a learning disability and autistic people who are inpatients in mental health hospitals by 35% by the end of March 2020, and through the Long Term Plan we will reduce numbers even further by investing in specialist services and community crisis care and giving local areas greater control of their budgets to reduce avoidable admissions and enable shorter lengths of stay.
""The CQC [Care Quality Commission] is also undertaking an in-depth review into the use of seclusion, segregation and restraint  - which should only be used as a last resort - in order to improve standards across the system.""",,,,

Rajiv Grover, from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, says latest UK data shows procedures have gone up 12% in a year, from 2,039 in 2017 to 2,286 in 2018.
He warned that there was no quick fix to fighting flab.
Surgery has risks as well as benefits and should be a ""last resort"", he said.

According to the new figures, more than 28,000 plastic surgery procedures took place in 2018, a small increase of 0.1% on 2017. 
Women underwent 92% of all cosmetic procedures recorded. 
As in 2017, the three most popular procedures for women were breast augmentation, breast reduction and blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery). 
The biggest increases for women were for liposuction, which rose 12%, and facelifts, which rose 9%.
Mr Grover, who runs the audit, said: ""The rise comes at a time where a fashion trend for women is athleisure clothing, showing what kind of physique you have rather than covering up.""
Athleisure includes figure-hugging clothing, such as leggings and bra tops, suitable for exercise and everyday wear. 
He said that the rise in liposuction could also be more women seeking fat loss surgery over less invasive fat freezing methods (although the audit data does not include non-surgical procedures). 
""People should know that liposuction is not risk-free,"" he said.
""An operation is not something that can simply be returned to the shop if you have second thoughts.""
He gave the example of footballer's wife Denise Hendry, who died in 2009 during one of several operations carried out to correct complications caused by botched liposuction. 
""People need to be aware that liposuction is an invasive procedure that carries risks. And it is not a cure for being overweight. There is no shortcut, although it can help with stubborn areas of fat.
""My advice? Eat a healthy diet and exercise if you want to get that gym body.""
Kate Dale, from Sport England's This Girl Can campaign said: ""We understand the pressures women feel under - our research shows that a fear of being judged is the number one reason stopping many women from getting active.
""It doesn't matter what you look like or how good you are, what matters is that you're getting active for you.""

The researchers at Northwestern University in Illinois and Google hope the technology could boost the effectiveness of cancer screening. 
Finding tumours at an earlier stage should make them easier to treat. 
The team said AI would have a ""huge"" role in the future of medicine, but the current software is not yet ready for clinical use.
The study focused on lung cancer, which kills more people - 1.8 million a year - than any other type of cancer. 
It is why the US recommends screening for people at high risk because of years of heavy smoking. 
However, screening can result in invasive biopsies for people who turn out not to have cancer, and also misses some tumours.
The study used artificial intelligence to see if the analysis of scans could be improved. 
The first step was to train the computer software with 42,290 CT lung scans from nearly 15,000 patients. 
The researchers did not tell the AI what to look for, just which patients went on to get cancer and which did not. 
The AI was then tested against a team of six radiologists who made a career out of analysing CT scans. 
It was more effective than the radiologists when examining a single CT scan and was equally effective when doctors had multiple scans to go on. 
The results, in Nature Medicine, showed the AI could boost cancer detection by 5% while also cutting false-positives (people falsely diagnosed with cancer) by 11%.
Dr Mozziyar Etemadi, from Northwestern University, told the BBC: ""The next step is to use it on patients in the form of a clinical trial.""
He says what the AI is using to identify a cancer is a ""little bit of a black box"".
He added: ""Sometimes it highlights a lung nodule (a growth) that for all intents and purposes looks benign but the model thinks it isn't.
""It's usually correct and one area of scientific inquiry is figuring out why.""
Dr Etemadi says that AI and doctors working side by side would be even more effective and that AI had a ""huge"" role to play in medicine. 
Rebecca Campbell, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""It's encouraging to see new technological innovations that could one day help us to detect lung cancer early. Similarly to how we learn from experience, deep learning algorithms perform a task repeatedly, each time tweaking it a little to improve accuracy.
""Detecting cancer early, when treatment is more likely to be successful, is one of the most powerful ways of improving survival, and developing inexpensive technology which isn't invasive could play an important role. 
""The next steps will be to test this technology further to see whether it can be applied accurately to large numbers of people.""

1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48338479,"Scientists say a new scan technique could identify people at risk of collapsing and dying suddenly from a hidden heart condition.
Normally, in people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, signs of structural changes in the heart can only be picked up after death.
But University of Oxford researchers used microscopic imaging to spot the same patterns in living patients.
The condition is the top cause of sudden cardiac death in young people.
It is a common, inherited condition, affecting one in 500 people in the UK, which can be fatal in small numbers of people.
Footballer Fabrice Muamba had a near-fatal cardiac arrest during a match while David Frost's son Miles died suddenly while jogging aged 31, for example.
Yet many of those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM, have few or no warning symptoms - and some are able to lead perfectly normal lives. 
The research team focused on detecting those at risk of sudden death, by looking for abnormal fibre patterns in the heart which could lead to potentially deadly heart rhythms.
This is thought to affect around 1% of people with the condition. 
They can then have a small device implanted in their heart to kick-start it into beating again when an abnormal heart rhythm is detected.
Dr Rina Ariga, study author and cardiologist at University of Oxford, said: ""We're hopeful that this new scan will improve the way we identify high-risk patients, so that they can receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator early to prevent sudden death.""
She added: ""We now need to work on making this scan shorter and faster for patients so that we can test its utility in a large multi-centre study.""
Currently, calculating a patient's risk is based on the thickness of their heart wall, their family history, plus any unexplained collapses and abnormal heart rhythms.
The difference with the Oxford researchers' approach is that they used MRI scans to look at detailed images of the structure of the heart muscle to check for ""muscle fibre disarray"".
This suggests that heartbeats are not allowed to spread evenly across the heart's muscle fibres.
The study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, scanned 50 patients with HCM and 30 healthy volunteers and were able to see ""disarray"" in living patients with the heart condition that had previously only been found in patients after sudden cardiac death.
These patients were also more likely to have abnormal heart rhythms.
The technique, called diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging, is normally used on the brain - but advances mean it can now be used on the heart.
Dr Steven Cox, chief executive of charity Cardiac Risk in the Young, said: ""It is fantastic to think in the future these clinical findings could be identified in patients living with HCM and used to help in their routine diagnostic and treatments pathways."" 
Dr Cox said the key to identifying those at risk in the general population was through cardiac screening ""using the cost effective and non-invasive ECG [electrocardiogram] test"". 
This is available to book for under 35s via the charity's Test My Heart website. 
Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which helped to fund the research, said: ""Although further work is needed to refine and test this scan, its potential benefit to patients with HCM is huge. 
""This work is an excellent example of cutting-edge, research-led technology that could change the way we diagnose and treat heart and circulatory diseases.""",,,,

The gas - nitrous oxide - is the second most commonly used recreational drug in England and Wales after cannabis.
But the Royal College of Nursing said many people remained ignorant of the risks.
Problems can include breathing difficulties, dangerously-increased heart rate, and burns as well as death, the RCN said.
Legislation introduced in 2016 made it illegal to sell the gas for psychoactive purposes.
But enforcing the legislation has proved difficult because it is used in food products, such as whipped cream, and medicine.

Nitrous oxide use has been linked to 17 deaths in the last three years, according to official statistics, with around one in 11 16-to 24-year-olds using it last year.
The RCN said its members were concerned, as they had been seeing patients with injuries from taking the drug.
Stuart McKenzie, a clinical nurse manager at NHS Ayrshire and Arran, said: ""I think the prevalence of people using it is far greater than anyone would suspect.
""Parents of teenagers might also know about cannabis and legal highs, but if you asked them about the dangers of nitrous oxide, how many of them could confidently say what they were.""
The issue is set to be debated at its conference on Tuesday with the union wanting to see more public warnings, particularly in the club and festival scene.
RCN mental health lead Catherine Gamble said: ""It might give a short-term high, but the long-term damage can be nothing to laugh about.

Robyn used to ""get mortal"" (drunk) and ""end up at random parties"". But when she was pregnant, she vowed to change.
She stopped drinking and smoking marijuana, saying: ""I used to be pretty crazy. Being pregnant has calmed me down.""
Teen births have been falling nationally but rising in Middlesbrough.
Robyn's mother Shelly recalls one night when the police arrived at the house - yet again. 
""It was around midnight and the police knocked on the door - they were bringing Robyn home from a party.
""She'd drunk an entire bottle of vodka at an unknown man's flat, passed out, got into the bath and was found sprawled naked on the living room floor. She was 15.""
Robyn added: ""When I met my boyfriend and got pregnant I realised that that couldn't happen any more.
""I'm so excited to meet my baby girl - we had a gender reveal party and even though I would have been happy with a boy, I really wanted my own little girl. 
""When we popped the balloon and I saw the pink confetti, I cried with happiness."" 
Her daughter is due at the end of June. 
Shelly said: ""Robyn is actually the fourth generation of teen mams in our family. 
""I've told Robyn it's time to grow up now and she has - I'm proud of how she's changed for her baby.
""When Robyn was a bit older I went to Durham University and completed a degree in human science - I think of it as doing my life the other way around."" 
In Middlesbrough, there were 43.8 teen pregnancies per 1,000 girls in the year to December 2017, compared with an average of 17.9 in England and Wales.
The next highest rate was in St Helens in Merseyside with 37.1 pregnancies per 1,000 teenagers. 
Teenage pregnancy is linked to fewer life chances - a higher risk of the child and the parent living in poverty, an increased risk of infant mortality and a higher chance of the mother experiencing mental health problems. 
It is more then 15 years since the government launched its Teenage Pregnancy Strategy in response to England having one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Western Europe. 
Since then, the under-18 conception rate has dropped by 60% and the proportion of teenage mothers in education and training has doubled.
But in Middlesbrough over the two years from 2015 to 2017 it jumped from 36.5 to 43.8 - a rise of 20%.
Megan, who is also from Middlesbrough, was 17 when she learned she was 23 weeks pregnant with her baby boy. 
She said: ""My baby will be loved and cared for. 
""I've finished my college course in performing arts and after about a year out I plan to either go back to college or get a job. 
""Being a teenage mam won't stop me. I'm lucky - my family are supportive.""

""The school to university to career to house to marriage to children isn't possible or desirable for all young women, yet those who take a different route through life are positioned as irresponsible, or as having somehow failed. 
""Teenage pregnancy is understood as a death knell for any kind of career success rather than acknowledging that post-16 education and careers are still available for women in their 30s or 40s when their children are grown up and they have time to start a new career.""

In 2013, Liat Malka was a single, 35-year-old kindergarten teacher living in southern Israel, when she felt the urgency of her biological clock ticking.
""I was worrying about time passing and maybe missing out on motherhood,"" Liat says. ""So I went to the doctor and did some fertility tests.""
When the results came back, they suggested that the number of eggs Liat had left was low. The doctor warned that if she waited for the right person to come along she might not ever become a mother. 
""So right away I decided that I would do anything I could to have a baby as soon as possible,"" Liat says.
When Liat arrived home, she immediately went online to explore her options.
""I really wanted my child to know their father and that's not possible with a sperm donor,"" she says. 
Liat Malka and Julia Pozniansky spoke to Outlook on the BBC World Service 
Listen again here
But then Liat stumbled across an interview on YouTube that had been broadcast on TV news in 2009.  In it, a couple called Vlad and Julia Pozniansky explained that they were trying to obtain legal permission to have a child using sperm left by their son, who had died the previous year. They had already found a woman to be the mother of their son's child. 
Liat wondered if a similar arrangement might also be a good option for her: ""Because this way the child can know who their father was, know their history and have grandparents and family,"" she says.
She decided to contact the couple's lawyer to ask for more details - and was surprised to learn that although four years had passed since the interview had been recorded, Vlad and Julia still didn't have a grandchild and the woman selected to be the mother was no longer on board. 
Liat arranged to meet the Poznianskys and on the day of the meeting the couple brought with them an album filled with photographs of their beloved son, Baruch.
More than a decade after his death, Julia still finds it almost unbearable to talk about her ""brilliant, outstanding"" son.
At 23, while studying ecology at the Technion, a renowned university in Haifa, Baruch noticed a wound in his mouth that wouldn't stop bleeding. It was later diagnosed as cancer. 
Because chemotherapy can slow down or stop sperm production, some of his sperm was banked and frozen before he began treatment. He lost his hair and eventually doctors had to partially remove his tongue, leaving him unable to speak - but not before he made a wish.
""He said that if he died he wanted us to find an appropriate woman and use his sperm to have a child,"" Julia says.
Baruch died on 7 November 2008 at the age of 25. He was single and childless.
Almost immediately Julia set to work trying to fulfil her deceased son's wish.
Before his death he had created a biological will with the lawyer, Irit Rosenblum. Rosenblum has spearheaded the posthumous reproduction cause in Israel and Baruch was the first person in the world to create such a will, which made his biological legacy legally binding - in this case, the banking of his sperm for the purpose of fathering a child.
Julia's task was not only to find a woman to be the child's mother, but also to get permission from an Israeli court to gain access to the sperm. 
With Irit Rosenblum's help, Vlad and Julia eventually found an Israeli woman of Russian origin who they thought could be a mother to their grandchild. They went to court to obtain permission to use Baruch's sperm and won their case, but within a week or two the woman had met a new partner and withdrawn from their agreement.
""Another young woman came to us, a very nice one,"" Julia says. The woman's name was added to the court verdict, instead of the first woman, and she began the IVF process. But after seven rounds the woman had failed to conceive, leaving the finite supply of Baruch's sperm depleted. 
""I was ready not to live any more. But I decided that if I was going to live I had to return some happiness to my life, and some love,"" she says.
""I wanted my son to continue living - somewhere deep in my heart I wanted to return him physically - I thought maybe a boy would be born who would look like Baruch."" 
Uncertain whether she'd ever be able to fulfil Baruch's dying wish, and longing for a baby in her life, at 55 Julia started trying with Vlad for another child, using IVF and a donor egg.
When their son was born, Julia says it felt like breathing fresh air again.
Julia clearly remembers the day that she and her husband first met Liat in early 2013.
""She was a beautiful young woman. Black hair, red coat, and I loved her from the very beginning,"" Julia says. ""I saw that she was a good person.""
She showed Liat the album of photos of Baruch that she'd brought with her and Liat says she felt an immediate connection to him.
""Just looking at the pictures I already knew who this person was - such good eyes, the biggest smile you can ever imagine, surrounded with friends and very handsome,"" she says.  
""And it looked like he was really connected to his parents, because in every picture they are holding hands and hugging. I could see the love and the happiness in his eyes - there was no doubt he was a great person.""
As Julia showed Liat the photos, she talked about how much Baruch had loved life, how smart he was, and how sociable, how he'd loved cooking and what great friends he'd had.
In that moment Liat decided that she wanted Baruch, a man she had never met and who had died five years previously, to be the father of her child.
 Liat, Vlad and Julia signed contracts which gave Liat ownership of the sperm so that nobody else could use it subsequently, and the contract also formalised arrangements for Vlad and Julia to visit. 
""To protect our rights to see the child,"" Julia explains. ""We were doing it not only to fulfil Baruch's will, but also to have a dear, beloved grandchild.""
No money changed hands - something that was very important to Vlad and Julia, in order to prevent attracting the wrong type of person.
Julia and Liat then had to meet a social worker who questioned them about what conflicts they anticipated in their relationship and even about what would happen if they quarrelled over what the child would be named. Julia felt as though the whole judicial system was playing God, deciding if a human being would live or not, and she told the social worker as much. 
""And this nice woman felt really uncomfortable with my answer,"" she says.
Liat then began fertility treatment, but her first round of IVF was unsuccessful.
""There was just one egg,"" Liat says. ""That was a shock - I expected more - and then it didn't develop to be an embryo.""
Liat tried to remain hopeful, but despite being given an increased dose of the medication which encourages the ovaries to produce more eggs, on the second attempt again there was only one egg.
""They fertilised it and I had to wait for a day and then call to find out if it was developing into an embryo,"" Liat says.
This time there was good news. 
""I thought, 'Wow, maybe this is it?'"" 
The fertilised egg was transferred into Liat's womb. For a week she rested, waited and hoped, then took a pregnancy test and called the hospital for the results.
""They were yelling like, 'Yeah, you're pregnant!'"" Liat says.
Liat shared the exciting news first with her sister and then with Julia. Then, over the following few days, the seriousness of her situation began to sink in.
""I was in shock - I didn't think it was going to happen,"" Liat admits. ""So when it did I just couldn't believe it. I didn't even know Vlad and Julia that much - I'd only met them two or maybe three times.""
Liat was worried about how her own family would get along with Baruch's family - her parents had come to Israel from Morocco, while Vlad and Julia come from Russia. The two families are culturally very different, she says.
At this point she had not even told her own mother about meeting Vlad and Julia and the plan to become a mother to their dead son's child.
""I didn't want the burden of everyone's opinions, especially my mum's, so I had kept it a secret,"" she says. ""But when I called her to say I was pregnant she was happy - at least I was having a child!""
Liat's pregnancy progressed but her doubts didn't diminish. She was very stressed and couldn't cope with trying to forge a relationship with Vlad and Julia while trying to grow a baby. At night she would dream about how her child might look.
Julia, too, was worried. She wanted to be closer to Liat, but had to respect Liat's wishes and keep her distance.
""I spoke to one of my relatives, a very wise woman, and she said, 'Let her have her child and afterwards everything will be OK,'"" Julia says.
When Liat went into labour she didn't feel comfortable about calling Julia to share the news, and told her own mother not to come to the hospital that evening since a doctor had advised her it was unlikely the baby would arrive before morning.  
""But at midnight she had a feeling, took a taxi and arrived at the hospital at the last minute,"" Liat says. ""I was very happy that she came. She was in so much shock that she couldn't even speak. My two sisters were with me too, and I have a sister in the US who was on Skype and we put her on the shelf. It was a really amazing experience.""
Shira was born on 1 December 2015, more than seven years after her father had died. 
""She was exactly like she was in the dream,"" Liat says. ""She was so beautiful, I really couldn't believe it.""
Liat called Vlad and Julia to tell them the news.
""I felt that my heart started to beat again for the first time after my terrible loss,"" Julia says.
The photos of Baruch that Julia brought when she first met Liat are now kept at Liat and Shira's apartment in Ashkelon, and they often look at them together, talking about the man in the photos who is smiling back at them. Liat points out Baruch's blue eyes, just like Shira's.
""One day she told me, 'Maybe soon he will knock at the door and come to see us,'"" Liat says. ""So I said, 'No, he won't come.'"" 
Shira is now three. Her mother says she does sometimes worry about Shira not having a father.
""But today you have so many kinds of families,"" Liat says, ""This is just another one. Shira knows that she does not have a father, but she's very loved and she's very happy.""
And having fulfilled her dying son's last wish, Julia has no doubts about what she has done, and feels certain that Baruch would love his daughter too.
""She's beautiful, she's smart, she's happy, she's everything you could want from a child,"" Julia says. ""She's perfect, she's really perfect.""

Sepsis, or blood poisoning, is a serious complication of an infection, which can have devastating consequences if not treated quickly.
There were delays in spotting Tom Ray's sepsis.
He says more training is needed to avoid such tragedies.
Tom Ray was fit and healthy and living in Rutland in the East Midlands before he contracted sepsis at the age of 38 in 1999.
He had had a successful career in corporate banking and was in the process of setting up a business with his pregnant wife, Nic, when he fell ill. 
His sepsis - thought to be caused by a cut to his gum during a trip to the dentist, combined with a chest infection - came on rapidly and led to vomiting and a high temperature.
But it took five hours at the hospital he was admitted to before the condition was diagnosed.
He spent months in a coma, during which time his wife Nic gave birth to their second child, Freddy.
His recovery has been a long and gruelling process, involving years of plastic surgery.
He has had to learn to walk, drive and live day-to-day life with prosthetic limbs.
The family lost their house and he has struggled to work.
""It is not the life I wanted to lead. It is not the life I wanted for my children. I have had some terrible lows, but I have learnt to battle on.""
He puts that down to several factors. The ""amazing"" love and care provided by his wife and being mentally disciplined. ""I have learnt to control what goes into my mind. I only let positive thoughts go in.
""I also realised it is not all about me. I had to be there for my children - to help them with their school work and take them places. Terrible things can happen in life, but you can get through them.""
Now 57, Tom spends a lot of his time doing motivational speaking and campaigning to improve the way the NHS tackles sepsis. 
Together with his wife and Pippa Bagnall, a former nurse and NHS chief executive, he has formed Resilience and Co to raise awareness of the problem.
He often removes his prosthetic limbs to show and shock the audience into the realities of sepsis. 
""I would rather not do this - it is not good for your mental health constantly going over the most difficult experience of my life. But I want to make a difference. I want to speak for those who can't - the people who have died from sepsis.""
The Rays and Ms Bagnall are due to address the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) annual conference in Liverpool on Wednesday.
Top of their wish list is mandatory training on sepsis for all staff who work in the health service.
Ms Bagnall says: ""It should be so simple to spot. But the problem is staff still do not know enough about it - what to look out for. Hospitals have got better, but there are real gaps in the community. 
""We want all staff, from GP receptionists to nurses and doctors, to have to do it. It could just be an hour online. It could make all the difference.""
The call is being supported by the RCN. 
The RCN also wants to see a national checklist introduced to help spot the signs of sepsis in children. Hospitals already have one for adults, but RCN professional lead for children Fiona Smith says there have been delays of more than a decade for one for children.
In the meantime it has been left to hospitals to develop their own approaches.
Ms Smith criticised the ""fragmented"" approach and ""very slow"" progress.
Every year more than 50,000 people die after contracting sepsis. Many thousands more are left with disabilities and life-changing consequences.
Symptoms include: 
Symptoms in young children include:
With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, normally antibiotics, most people make a full recovery.

Aspirin thins the blood and so doctors have been cautious about giving it, fearing it could make bleeds worse. 
But The Lancet research suggests it does not increase the risk of new brain bleeds, and may even lower it. 
Experts say the ""strong indication"" needs confirming with more research.
Only take daily aspirin if your doctor recommends it, they advise.
Aspirin is best known as a painkiller and is sometimes also taken to help bring down a fever. 
But daily low-dose (75mg) aspirin is used to make the blood less sticky and can help to prevent heart attacks and stroke.
Most strokes are caused by clots in the blood vessels of the brain but some are caused by bleeds.
Because aspirin thins the blood, it can sometimes make the patient bleed more easily.
And aspirin isn't safe for everyone. 
It can also cause indigestion and, more rarely, lead to stomach ulcers. 
Never give aspirin to children under the age of 16 (unless their doctor prescribes it). 
It can make children more likely to develop a very rare but serious illness called Reye's syndrome (which can cause liver and brain damage).
The research involved 537 people from across the UK who had had a brain bleed while taking anti-platelet medicines, to stop blood clotting, including aspirin, dipyridamole or another drug called clopidogrel. 
The work is being presented at the European Stroke Organisation Conference in Milan.
The research cannot prove that aspirin prevents future strokes but it appears to be linked to a lower risk. 
Nor does it suggest that aspirin is always safe to take. 
But it hints that more patients - those with haemorrhagic or brain bleed strokes - might benefit from daily treatment.
It's not clear if the study findings will apply to all patients in real life. 
Lead researcher, Prof Rutsam Salman, from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""At the moment, people do not know what the right thing to do is. 
""Doctors are hesitant about giving aspirin or aspirin-like drugs to people who have had this type of stroke. 
""UK and European guidelines do not give any recommendation, because there hasn't been enough evidence.
""I think we have now confirmed safety with these findings.
""It certainly seems that aspirin is safe enough to give.""
Prof Salman recommended more work to see if aspirin might actually lower the risk of brain bleeds as well as clots. 
Prof Metin Avkiran, from the British Heart Foundation, which funded the research, said: ""Around a third of people who suffer a brain haemorrhage, also known as haemorrhagic stroke, do so when they are taking an anti-platelet medicine, such as aspirin, to reduce the risk of a heart attack or an ischaemic [blood clot] stroke. 
""We now have a strong indication they can carry on taking these potentially life-saving medicines after the brain haemorrhage without increasing the risk of another one, which is crucial new information for both patients and doctors.""
Anyone with concerns should speak to a doctor before considering changing medication, however.

With more urinals than cubicles, men - unlike women - rarely queue, a Royal Society for Public Health report says.
It blames the closure of hundreds of council-run toilets for deterring some people from leaving the house.
The government said it was down to councils to manage their resources and provide necessary services for people.
The Royal Society's report says that people with health problems or a disability are most affected by the lack of public conveniences.
It adds that public toilets ""should be considered as essential as streetlights, roads and waste collection"".
But it said the lack of facilities in the UK was affecting equality, mobility, fitness and other aspects of health - yet no-one wanted to pay for them.
In a survey of more than 2,000 adults for the report, two in five people with a medical condition requiring frequent trips to the toilet, said they didn't feel able to go out as often as they wanted because of ""loo leash"".
In some US states and Canada, attempts have been made to introduce ""potty parity"" legislation to reflect the longer amount of time women need when using the toilet.
Lorna Goudie, a 31-year-old library assistant based in Liverpool, has had irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) for 10 years. 
""If I go somewhere unfamiliar I can get quite stressed about where the toilets are and how quickly I can get to them,"" she says.  
""In a way it is like you are recovering from an upset stomach but are not quite sure if you are fully better, so you could need the toilet very quickly - for some people it can be like that all the time.
""So for example, I love the countryside and have friends who invite me on long walks, but I don't go because I don't like being far from the city.""
Lorna runs a local support group for people with IBS and says the issue comes up frequently. 
""It is getting very trendy at the moment to turn toilets into bars, but the fact is people really need them - whether you have IBS or not.""
A BBC map of public toilet provision in 2018 found there were 4,486 run by major councils in the UK, down from 5,159 in 2010.
And in 37 council areas, there were no public toilets provided at all.
The report said this was leading to people ""holding it in"" or urinating in the streets, which is unhygienic and could lead to illness from contamination.
The standard ratio of female to male toilets in the UK is 1:1 but because of higher numbers of urinals in male toilets, this is rarely achieved, the Royal Society says.
The report said equality of access to toilets was also important for transgender people.
A spokesperson for the Local Government Association said: ""Councils are doing everything they can to keep public toilets open, and this includes running community toilet schemes, which enable local businesses like pubs, restaurants and shops to make more clean, safe and accessible toilets available to the public.
""Faced with an £8bn funding gap by 2025 and growing demand pressures on adult social care, children's services and homelessness support, councils have had to make tough choices about how to manage dwindling resources."" 
A government spokeswoman said public toilets were ""a valuable community amenity"".
""Councils, not central government, are responsible for managing their own resources and providing the local services people need, including public toilets.""",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48364784,"Up to 50 patients, some with learning disabilities and autism who should be released, are stuck in secure units run by a mental health hospital charity. 
St Andrew's Healthcare, which treats up to 900 patients, told the BBC there was a lack of suitable community places. 
Footage of a teenager locked in seclusion, able to touch their parent only through a door hatch at one of its units, has been shown to the BBC.
The hospital said seclusion was used as an emergency response only.
St Andrew's Healthcare runs four private hospitals that specialise in caring for patients with severe mental health and learning difficulties - 90% of referrals are from the NHS.
Patients are supposed to be admitted to these assessment and treatment units (ATUs) for nine to 18 months but the average stay nationally is five years. 
Chief executive Katie Fisher told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme one patient had been detained for an extra 524 days after they should have been released. 
""It varies over time and of course the reasons for delays are complex,"" she said.
""This isn't someone sitting on something, who isn't doing their job properly.
""Maybe several attempts have been made to create a discharge and for several reasons that has fallen through.""
Last month, the programme reported that one St Andrew's Healthcare patient, Ayla Haines 26, had tried to kill herself after spending seven years in an ATU. 
Following this, Labour's shadow care minister, Barbara Keeley, announced an all-party parliamentary group to investigate mental health hospitals.
On Monday, research by the children's commissioner for England found too many children were being admitted to mental health hospitals unnecessarily - despite a government pledge to move up to 50% of such patients into community settings by March 2019. 
Ms Fisher said continuing to detain patients who no longer needed to be in ATUs was unacceptable,
""But actually, people's mental health and wellbeing can fluctuate over time, so it's not as simple as just saying someone needs to be here and someone doesn't need to be here.""
Hospitals use a seclusion room as a last resort if a patient is in extreme distress or is a risk to themselves or a member of staff.
In a damning report published this week, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) called for a review of every patient in long-term seclusion or segregation in mental health hospitals across the UK. 
The Victoria Derbyshire programme was given footage of a teenager reaching their arm through a door hatch to enable contact with their parents during a visit to a St Andrew's hospital. 
The parent told the programme the patient had been held in seclusion for months.
A recent CQC inspection of St Andrew's Hospital in Northampton found one patient had had repeated and prolonged periods of seclusion over 18 months.
The hospital said it would not comment on individual cases.
But Ms Fisher said: ""In some seclusion rooms for certain types of patients, there is the opportunity to for food and other things that patient might need to be given to them through an opening of the door, which means the door itself doesn't have to be opened. 
""The use of seclusion rooms is only ever used as an emergency response and if all other efforts of de-escalation, both verbal and low-stimulation rooms, have failed.""
Another CQC inspection report, published in 2016, found a technique called prone - or face-down - restraint was being used widely across wards at the St Andrew's hospitals.
Its use has reduced - but there were still more than 1,000 recorded incidents last year. 
Between 2016 and 2018, prone restraint was used by staff on patients 5,597 times.
This is despite a consultant psychiatrist at St Andrews telling the Victoria Derbyshire programme prone restraint should not be used. 
""It is something that is associated with death in some circumstances - certainly within the charity, we have reduced the amount of prone restraint that we use drastically over many years,"" said Paul Wallang.
But he added: ""Sometimes when somebody is restrained they will move into the restraint position in a prone. 
""If that happens, we immediately move them to supine, which is face-up, a much safer way to restrain - and all of our staff are trained in that technique.""
A government spokeswoman said: ""The NHS is committed to reducing numbers of people with a learning disability and autistic people who are inpatients in mental health hospitals by 35% by the end of March 2020.
""And through the [NHS] Long Term Plan, we will reduce numbers even further by investing in specialist services and community crisis care and giving local areas greater control of their budgets to reduce avoidable admissions and enable shorter lengths of stay.
""The CQC is also undertaking an in-depth review into the use of seclusion, segregation and restraint - which should only be used as a last resort - in order to improve standards across the system.""

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the cost of prochlorperazine rose from £6.49 per pack to £51.68, after suppliers agreed not to compete.
The drug is often prescribed to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
One of the firms named, Alliance Pharma, denied the allegations.
In a statement of objections, the CMA says that between 2013 and 2018, the annual cost of 3mg dissolvable prochlorperazine tablets increased from approximately £2.7m to £7.5m, even though the NHS dispensed fewer packs during that period.
It claimed that sharp increase was the result of four companies - Alliance Pharma, Focus, Lexon and Medreich - agreeing not to compete against each other for the supply of the prescription-only pills.
Alliance supplied prochlorperazine exclusively to Focus, which the CMA says then paid Lexon a share of its profits from the sales.
Lexon, the competition regulator alleges, then shared these payments with Medreich.
The CMA alleges that, before entering into this arrangement, Lexon and Medreich had been planning to launch their own jointly-developed prochlorperazine.
In a statement, Alliance said it had ""no involvement in the pricing or distribution of prochlorperazine since 2013, when it was out-licensed by the company to Focus Pharmaceuticals Limited on an exclusive basis as is normal market practice"".
The firm added: ""Alliance has not had control of or influence on, and nor has it benefited from, any price increases.""
The BBC has contacted Focus, Lexon and Medreich for comment.
The CMA's Ann Pope said: ""Agreements where a company pays a rival not to enter the market can lead to higher prices and deprive the NHS of huge savings that often result from competition between drug suppliers.
""The NHS should not be denied the opportunity of benefitting from an increased choice of suppliers, or lower prices, for important medicine.""
The companies concerned will now have the opportunity to respond to the CMA's provisional findings.
If it eventually determines that competition law has been broken, the CMA can impose a financial penalty of up to 10% of each company's worldwide turnover.",,,,

Public Health England said even one person missing their vaccinations was ""too many"".
There were 795 cases of mumps in the first three months of 2019, compared with 1,031 in the whole of 2018.
Most mumps cases are linked to teenagers mixing when they go to university.
A large outbreak was centred on Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham at the beginning of the year and similar increases in cases have been reported in Wales and Northern Ireland. 
The disease is caused by a virus that infects and causes painful swellings in the parotid glands under the ears. 
In rarer cases, it can lead to viral meningitis and swollen ovaries or testicles. 
Mumps is one of the infections the MMR vaccine protects against or at least lessens the symptoms of.
However, many of the students now at university were born at the peak of the MMR-autism scare around the turn of the century, when vaccination rates dropped.
The autism link, made by disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield, has since been completely disproved. 
""If you're going to university, now's the time to catch up if you missed out as a child,"" said Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at Public Health England.
Public Health England has also reported outbreaks of measles in London, the North West and the East of England.
In the first quarter of 2019, there were 231 confirmed cases.
The World Health Organization says we are in the middle of a global measles crisis. 
Cases in the UK are largely within communities with low-vaccination rates and are linked to travel to other countries with outbreaks. 
Dr Ramsay added: ""Measles can kill and it is incredibly easy to catch, especially if you are not vaccinated. 
""Even one child missing their vaccine is one too many - if you are in any doubt about your child's vaccination status, ask your GP as it's never too late to get protected.""
Helen Bedford, professor of child public health at UCL, said: ""Measles is a highly infectious, potentially serious disease and England has not escaped the recent increase in cases we have seen globally.  
""If you are unvaccinated or in doubt about whether you are protected, contact your GP practice.""

They say thousands of people could be at risk from lacerations, friction burns, fractures and ligament injuries. 
There were 30 serious hand injuries caused by dog leads last year in Cornwall alone, the British Society for Surgery of the Hand said.
One of those was to Jillian Tisdale, 65, who has two retrievers.
WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE OF FINGER INJURY FOLLOWS BELOW
She had just finished walking one of her dogs when it became distracted by another dog and ran off excitedly on the lead.
The lead ended up wrapped tightly around Jillian's middle fingers on her right hand, causing severe damage, including the ""degloving"" of her finger - when the skin and some of the soft tissue are ripped off.
She said the retractable lead she used acted like a ""filleting knife"", causing ""terrible pain"". 
She also suffered severe cuts and dislocated her index finger, after the incident several months ago.
Jillian needed surgery to remove the top part of her middle finger and a skin graft. She has been left with a shorter middle finger, as a result.
""I still can't form a proper fist yet and I'm continuing to do exercises to strengthen my hand,"" she says.
But she said she was planning to return to her hobbies of diving, mountain climbing, and even dog-walking, soon.
Jillian was treated by consultant surgeon Rebecca Dunlop, from Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, who also collected the data on hand injuries from dog leads.
She said she had noticed an increase in this type of ""devastating"" injury in recent years, which can need long-term treatment and means the fingers often do not return to normal.
Mrs Dunlop said: ""Having seen many serious injuries caused by dog leads and collars, I want dog lovers to be aware of the simple steps they can take to avoid severe damage to their hand.""
She said hand injuries could also be very costly ""through time off work and medical costs"".

Taking steroids to get a buff physique or anti-baldness pills to keep a full head of hair can damage fertility. 
It has been named the Mossman-Pacey paradox after the scientists who first described it.
They say it causes a lot of heartache in couples struggling to conceive.
""I noticed some men coming in to have their fertility tested and these guys were huge,"" says Dr James Mossman, now at Brown University in the United States.
He was studying for his doctorate in Sheffield when he made the connection with steroid abuse.
He told the BBC: ""They are trying to look really big, to look like the pinnacles of evolution.
""But they are making themselves very unfit in an evolutionary sense, because without exception they had no sperm in their ejaculation at all.""
Anabolic steroids mimic the effect of the male hormone testosterone in the body and are used as performance-enhancing drugs to increase muscle growth.
They are regularly used by bodybuilders. 
Prof Allan Pacey, from the University of Sheffield, added: ""Isn't it ironic that men go to the gym to look wonderful, for the most part to attract women, and inadvertently decrease their fertility."" 
Anabolic steroids fool the brain's pituitary gland into thinking the testes are going into overdrive.
So the glands react by shutting down the production of two hormones - called FSH and LH - which are the key hormones that drive the production of sperm.
The researchers say there is a similar theme in men using medication to prevent male pattern baldness.
The drug finasteride changes the way testosterone is metabolised in the body and can limit hair loss, but side effects can include erectile dysfunction and a hit to fertility. 
Prof Pacey told the BBC: ""I would say more anabolic steroid users are likely to become sterile than you would think - 90% probably.
""Baldness is a bit more hit-and-miss, but sales are going through the roof and that makes it an increasingly common problem.""
The measure of success in evolutionary terms is passing on your genes (instructions in your DNA) to the next generation. 
Dr Mossman said taking these vanity-based medications might make you more attractive but could turn you into ""an evolutionary dud"".
It is not the equivalent of the extravagant peacock's tail, which makes males more attractive to females and increases the chances of passing genes on to the next generation. 
There are some examples in the natural world where an animal sacrifices their ability to breed.
Some bird species perform co-operative breeding in which individuals forego having their own offspring to help raise the descendants of close relatives.
But even this can make sense in evolutionary terms as half of your genes are shared with siblings so they are still being passed on, just indirectly.
Dr Mossman suspects ""thinking you're more appealing to the opposite sex, but killing your fertility"" is probably unique to humans. 
Prof Pacey told the BBC: ""The irony is one thing, but I think the key message is for fertility patients.
""It keeps cropping up in clinics and the message is not getting out to young men that it's a problem and a bit of info could save them a lot of heartache.""

1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48397341,"There has been a sharp increase in cases of mumps this year in England - but the viral illness which can cause swollen glands (and, more rarely, testes) has been around for a very long time.
Way back in the 5th Century BC, Hippocrates is thought to be the first person to have recorded the symptoms of the disease.
The Greek physician described ""swellings... about the ears, in many on either side, and in the greatest number on both sides"".
His observations clearly point to the classic sign of mumps - the puffy-cheeked appearance which affects many, though not all, of those affected.
This is a result of the mumps virus causing the swelling and inflammation of one or both parotid glands, which sit in front of the ears.
It can lead to difficulty opening the mouth to talk, eat and drink.
And this recognisable symptom probably gave the illness its name.
Mumps is a strange word for an illness, and it has no clear origin.
It could come from the old English word for grimace or sulk - mump - or it may be linked to the Icelandic word for a mouth being filled too full - mumpa - and the Dutch for mumble, ""mompelen"".
However, the overriding impression is that the distinctive ""hamster face"" appearance of the illness has influenced its name.
But it is not the only part of the body that can swell up - in rare cases, the testes, the pancreas, the brain and the ovaries can too.
""It doesn't make boys sterile - that's a myth,"" says Prof Helen Bedford, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.
Mumps is, however, more serious and more painful the older you are.
Headaches, fever and ear pain often accompany the swelling.
Mumps has not only reappeared this year, despite the rise in cases.
Before the MMR vaccine - the second M stands for mumps - was introduced in the UK in 1988, eight out of 10 people developed mumps and most of them were children of school age.
At that time, there were five deaths a year from mumps, mainly due to encephalitis or swelling of the brain.
After then, the illness became relatively rare but it started coming back again in the 2000s, with the largest outbreak in 2005 rising to more than 43,000 cases in England and Wales.
Cases have never spiked like that again, but outbreaks are common and cases of mumps consistently outnumber measles and rubella cases each year.
Teenagers and young adults in colleges and universities are now the ones who tend to be affected - for several reasons.
They may be too old to have been immunised or offered the MMR, or may only have had one dose of the vaccine - or they had two doses, but the vaccine's protection against mumps has worn off.
""The mumps vaccine is not as effective as other bits of MMR, which is why it's important to have two doses,"" says Prof Bedford.
Close-mixing groups of young people in other countries are similarly affected by mumps outbreaks.
The virus is easily spread, through saliva or droplets in a cough or sneeze - a bit like colds and flu.
Prof Bedford says it is important to remember the impact of mumps (as well as measles and rubella) on children, and young people.
""Mumps can make children feel very unwell and stay in bed for days.
""It's not nothing. Perhaps we've lost sight of what these illnesses are really like,"" she says.
Thankfully, we have Hippocrates to remind us.",,,,

The liquid gel spacer increases the distance between the prostate and rectum to reduce the amount of radiation absorbed during treatment.
It is injected before treatment and stays in place during radiation therapy before being naturally absorbed.
The treatment will now be rolled out to 12 hospitals around the UK.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed in England each year.
When it is caught early enough, radiotherapy can be highly effective.
High-energy X-rays are targeted at the prostate, killing cancer cells and preventing them from spreading.
However, due to close proximity, nearby healthy organs can be affected resulting in side effects including rectal bleeding, erectile dysfunction, bowel and bladder damage.  
Alan Clarke, from Bristol, first had radiotherapy in 2011 but the cancer returned.
He was selected to be the first NHS patient to receive the spacer because he was considered to be more at risk of suffering side effects from a second course of radiotherapy.
Two syringes mix together the gel so that once injected, it sets within seconds. 
Prof Amit Bahl, consultant oncologist at the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""The space we have created means the rectum will not get the toxicity from the radiotherapy.

The newly-approved version instead places issues of gender incongruence under a chapter on sexual health. 
A World Health Organization expert said it now understands transgender is ""not actually a mental health condition"".
Human Rights Watch says the change will have a ""liberating effect worldwide"". 
In the latest manual, called the ICD-11, gender incongruence is defined as a marked and persistent incongruence between a person's experienced gender and assigned sex. 
In the previous version - ICD-10 - this was considered a gender identity disorder, in the chapter entitled mental and behavioural disorders. 
Dr Lale Say, a reproductive health expert at the World Health Organization, said: ""It was taken out from mental health disorders because we had a better understanding that this was not actually a mental health condition, and leaving it there was causing stigma. 
""So in order to reduce the stigma, while also ensuring access to necessary health interventions, this was placed in a different chapter.""
Commenting on the revisions, Graeme Reid, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights director at campaign group Human Rights Watch, said the changes would have a ""liberating effect on transgender people worldwide"".
He added: ""Governments should swiftly reform national medical systems and laws that require this now officially outdated diagnosis.""
Meanwhile, nine organisations working on gender identity said in a joint statement: ""It has taken us a long time to get here. Until a few years ago, removing pathologising categories affecting trans and gender diverse people from the ICD-10 list of mental disorders seemed impossible. 
""Today, we know that full depathologisation can be achieved and will be achieved in our lifetime.""
The statement added: ""Although placement in this chapter is an improvement, it is by no means perfect. For example, it is somewhat reductive to define trans health as related only to sexual health.''
The WHO's removal of gender identity disorder from its diagnostic chapter - or no longer classifying being transgender as a mental illness - has resulted in muted celebration and/or more questions from those who watch identity conversations.
Firstly, there is the issue of what the removal actually means in practical terms. 
Will the move be liberating for transgender people worldwide - particularly those in countries where activists speak of misdiagnoses and intimidation from medical staff when discussing gender identity? 
Will it truly remove stigma for marginalised communities if no further resources are funnelled into attitudinal education?
Then there is the term of gender incongruence (a desire to be of a gender other than one's assigned sex) that the World Health Organization still uses to describe transgender people. 
Language, especially when it comes to gender, matters. It is the incongruence part - defined ""out of place"" - that make some activists feel the WHO is not as progressive as this move would initially appear.
Yet other parts of the ICD were zoned in on by other minority groups. More than 50 intersex organisations signed a joint statement condemning the WHO for terming variations in sex development as ""disorders of sex development.""

Chelsie Thomas was admitted to Walsall Manor Hospital with the pregnancy in her right tube in March last year.
During an operation, the surgeon removed the left fallopian tube instead, which Chelsie, 27, said had ""destroyed everything"".
The hospital apologised and admitted an error was ""regrettably made"".
Ms Thomas' ectopic pregnancy was discovered after she experienced bleeding and went to the hospital - where she had been working as a healthcare assistant for nine years - on 7 March last year.
She had surgery the same day, where her healthy fallopian tube was removed.
Ms Thomas, who lives in Walsall, told the surgeon the scan showed the pregnancy in her right tube but said she was told: ""I'm a doctor, you should trust me.""
But a week later, when she was still in excruciating pain, she returned to hospital where the blunder was discovered.
She had to have her remaining fallopian tube removed and is now unable to have children without IVF treatment.

Ms Thomas, who already has a six-year-old son Riley, said her relationship with her partner broke down as a result of the surgery and she has also lost her job and is on anti-depressants.
She said the surgeon who operated on her ""shouldn't be allowed to touch another woman again"".
""I have had to explain [to my son] that he cannot have a brother or sister,"" she added.
Jenna Harris, Ms Thomas' solicitor at Irwin Mitchell, said the original procedure was ""carried out without appropriate due diligence and attention"".
Dr Matthew Lewis, the medical director at Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, admitted surgeons made a mistake and said ""our care fell below the standard that we would expect"". 
He said the trust worked with ""patients and their families, our own clinicians and staff to learn lessons and put systems in place to try and avoid such incidents"".

1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48446924,"Ultra-processed foods - such as chicken nuggets, ice cream and breakfast cereals - have been linked to early death and poor health, scientists say. 
Researchers in France and Spain say the amount of such food being eaten has soared.
Their studies are not definite proof of harm but do come hot on the heels of trials suggesting ultra-processed foods lead to overeating.
Experts expressed caution but called for further investigation. 
The term comes from a way of classifying food by how much industrial processing it has been through.
The lowest category is ""unprocessed or minimally processed foods"", which include: • fruit • vegetables • milk • meat • legumes such as lentils • seeds • grains such as rice • eggs
""Processed foods"" have been altered to make them last longer or taste better - generally using salt, oil, sugar or fermentation.
This category includes: • cheese • bacon • home-made bread • tinned fruit and vegetables • smoked fish • beer
Then come ""ultra-processed foods"", which have been through more substantial industrial processing and often have long ingredient lists on the packet, including added preservatives, sweeteners or colour enhancers. 
If a product contains more than five ingredients, it is probably ultra-processed, says Prof Maira Bes-Rastrollo, of the University of Navarra, citing a maxim.
Examples include: • processed meat such as sausages and hamburgers • breakfast cereals or cereal bars • instant soups • sugary fizzy drinks • chicken nuggets • cake • chocolate • ice cream • mass-produced bread • many ""ready to heat"" meals such as pies and pizza | meal-replacement shakes 
The first study, by the University of Navarra, in Spain, followed 19,899 people for a decade and assessed their diet every other year. There were 335 deaths during the study.
But for every 10 deaths among those eating the least ultra-processed food, there were 16 deaths among those eating the most (more than four portions a day).
The second study, by the University of Paris, followed 105,159 people for five years and assessed their diet twice a year.
It showed those eating more ultra-processed food had worse heart health. 
Rates of cardiovascular disease were 277 per 100,000 people per year among those eating the most ultra-processed food, compared with 242 per 100,000 among those eating the least. 
The rapid increase of ultra-processed foods over less processed foods, ""may drive a substantial burden of cardiovascular diseases in the next decades,"" said Dr Mathilde Touvier, of the University of Paris.
""[The] evidence is accumulating,"" said Dr Touvier, noting ""increasing numbers of independent studies"". Prof Bes-Rastrollo said she was ""very certain"" ultra-processed foods were bad for health.
Last year, a link was made with an increased risk of cancer.
The challenge is being 100% sure. The studies have spotted a pattern between highly processed food and poor health but they cannot prove that one causes the other. 
Those who ate the most ultra-processed food were also more likely to have other unhealthy behaviours, such as smoking, which the researchers tried to account for. 
But there's no guarantee everything relevant was covered, says Kevin McConway, a professor of statistics at The Open University.
""These studies do increase my confidence that there's something real behind these associations - but I'm still far from sure.""
The first trial of ultra-processed foods showed they led people to eat more and put on weight. 
Researchers at the US National Institutes of Health monitored every morsel of food that volunteers ate for a month.
And when given ultra-processed food, they ate 500 calories a day more than when they were given unprocessed meals.
Other suggestions include: 
These ideas still need researching.
While the term ultra-processed food may be new, the health advice will be very familiar: adopt a Mediterranean-style diet.
Such a diet includes plenty of minimally or unprocessed foods, such as fruit, vegetables, fish, nuts and seeds, beans, lentils and wholegrains, said Victoria Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation.
""This, along with exercising regularly and not smoking, has been shown to be beneficial for lowering risk of heart and circulatory disease.""
Measures such as taxation and marketing restrictions on ultra-processed foods, should be considered, said Prof Bes-Rastrollo, given the weight of evidence. 
There are certainly a lot of critics. 
The labelling of food as ultra-processed could be inconsistent, said Dr Gunter Kuhnle, an expert in nutrition and health at the University of Reading
""It is also not obvious why salami is considered to be ultra-processed, yet cheese, which often requires considerably more processing steps and additives, is not.  The classification combines a wide range of foods with very different potential impacts on health, which limits its usefulness as a basis for recommendations.""
The studies were published in the British Medical Journal.

1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48457401,"A number of US media giants have publicly stated they will reconsider filming in Georgia if the state's strict new abortion law takes effect.
Disney, Netflix and WarnerMedia have all objected to the legislation, which would ban abortion after a foetal heartbeat can be detected.
The so-called ""heartbeat bill"" has caused a furious backlash in Hollywood and led to calls for a boycott.
Georgia makes billions of dollars from film and television productions.
The state's bill seeks to make abortion illegal as soon as a foetal heartbeat is detectable. In most cases, this is at the six-week mark of a pregnancy - before many women even know they are pregnant.
It is one of a number of states to pass abortion restrictions in the past year, but they are expected to face legal challenges.
Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney says the law would make it ""difficult"" for the company to keep filming there.
Blockbusters like Black Panther and Avengers: Endgame, were recently shot in the state, due to its generous tax breaks for film productions.
However, Mr Iger said ""many people who work for us will not want to work there"" should the law go into effect.
""We will have to heed their wishes,"" he told Reuters.
WarnerMedia meanwhile said it would reconsider Georgia ""if the new law holds"", after Netflix announced on Tuesday it would ""rethink"" its productions in the state should the law take effect.
Earlier this week, Netflix said it would ""rethink"" its operations there with chief content officer Ted Sarandos explaining: ""We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,"" 
He said the streaming giant would ""work with the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] and others to fight it in court.""
Meanwhile, stars including Amy Schumer, Ben Stiller, Christina Applegate, Laverne Cox and Alec Baldwin wrote to the governor saying they would ""do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women"".
Comedy actress and writer Kristen Wiig also confirmed to CNN that her new comedy had pulled out of filming in the state while the executive producers of a new Amazon show The Power said it was no longer scouting for filming locations in Georgia because of the controversial bill.
Actor Jason Bateman, who stars in the Netflix show Ozark and in HBO's The Outsider, which are both currently filming in Georgia, told The Hollywood Reporter: ""I will not work in Georgia, or any other state, that is so disgracefully at odds with women's rights"".
""Right now we are watching it very carefully,"" said Disney's Bob Iger, adding he didn't ""see how it's practical for us to continue to shoot there.""
Disney's prospective withdrawal would be a huge blow to the state. Recently, Disney's Marvel Studios filmed portions of both Black Panther and Avengers: Endgame in Georgia. 
Georgia - which offers up to 30% tax breaks - has become a magnet for film and TV productions, employing more than 90,000 people.
Website Film LA analysed a sample of the 100 top-grossing feature films released at the US box office in 2017 and found Georgia was tied for second place, behind California, as a location with the UK, each with 15 films in the top 100 in 2017. 
British location manager Steve Mortimore has worked with both Disney and Netflix and scouted for films including World War Z, the forthcoming Wonder Woman sequel and Ridley Scott's All The Money in the World.
He told the BBC the clash over Georgia's abortion law could have ""massive ramifications"".
Aside from Georgia's generous tax breaks for filmmakers, he said, ""they have trained so many people to work in the industry, and so many experts have moved there who will have to move away again"".
Speaking about Disney and Netflix's threats to pull out of Georgia entirely, he told the BBC: ""I'd be surprised if they went ahead and pulled out unless they had a plan B or C.
""Those big Marvel films, they need huge spaces, 100,000 to 150,000 sq ft sound stages with all the facilities and they are limited. I know that Europe is absolutely fully booked up, there isn't anywhere else"".
In 2014, the British-based Pinewood studios opened Pinewood Atlanta, spanning 700 acres and providing 18 sound stages. It has declined to comment on the news reports, but Mortimore said it could be be ""very painful for them"". 
He claimed that London has now displaced Hollywood as the film industry's new capital, adding ""the space just isn't available, people are queuing to film [in the UK] for the next three or four years"".
""It's an opportunity for somewhere else,"" he said. ""Maybe LA can step in. They have huge TV productions but its a chance to stick their flag in the sand and say they are a major hub for movies again, which they lost to London.""
Recent productions based in Georgia include: Godzilla: King of Monsters, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, Black Panther, Pitch Perfect 3, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Stranger Things, Ozark and The Walking Dead.
It is one of several US states to pass new, stricter laws on abortion, the latest being Louisiana.
The new law prevents abortions in almost all circumstances once an embryonic heartbeat can be detected. 
Critics have pointed at what they see as an orchestrated challenge to a decades-old US Supreme Court ruling that protected a woman's right to choose an abortion.

Baby Saybie weighed the same as a large apple when she was born at 23 weeks and three days in December 2018.
Fighting for life, she was transferred to the intensive care unit at Sharp Mary Birch Hospital in San Diego, California.
Doctors told Saybie's parents she had just hours to live. 
But five months on, she was discharged weighing a healthy 5.6 pounds (2.5kg), confounding all expectations.
A nurse who cared for Saybie as she battled for survival said her recovery and release earlier this month was a ""miracle"".
The Tiniest Babies Registry said Saybie is thought to be the world's smallest surviving premature baby.
The previous record was held by a baby girl from Germany, born weighing 252g (8.9oz) in 2015, according to the registry, operated by the University of Iowa.
A baby, born weighing just 268g (9.45oz) in Japan earlier this year, is thought to be the smallest boy to have survived premature birth.
Saybie's mother gave birth to the little girl by emergency C-section three months ahead of schedule after she was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia - a pregnancy complication involving high blood pressure which can prove fatal for mother and baby.
In a video released by the hospital, the mother described the birth as the ""scariest day of my life"".
""I kept telling them: 'She's not going to survive. She's - I'm only 23 weeks [pregnant]',"" the mother, who has chosen to remain anonymous, said. 
Her birth was so premature, doctors considered her a ""micro preemie"" - a baby born before 28 weeks' gestation. Babies are typically born between 37 and 42 weeks into pregnancy, the hospital said.
She was so small she could ""fit in the palm of the hands of her care team"", it said.
Her survival, doctors believe, could be attributed to the fact that she suffered no serious complications after birth.
""Saybie experienced virtually none of the medical challenges typically associated with micro preemies, which can include brain bleeds, and lung and heart issues,"" the hospital said.",,,,
1905,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48431858,"Instagram users are debating the social media platform's censoring of images of healed self-harm scars. 
Some people who have recovered from self-harm are finding images of themselves are being taken down or blurred if scars are on view, and believe this is because of a change in policy by the platform.  
However, others who have recovered, or are recovering, have posted that they can find pictures of scars troubling.
Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, told the BBC in February that the platform was going to change its policy to ""not allow any graphic images of self-harm"", following the death of Molly Russell. 
Molly took her own life in 2017 and when her family looked into her Instagram account, they found distressing material about depression and suicide. Molly's father Ian says he believes Instagram is partly responsible for his daughter's death.
Under the hashtag #youcantcensormyskin, people all over the world have been discussing what imagery is acceptable and what is not. 
In a post addressed to Instagram, artist and mental health advocate Hannah Daisy, from London, asked the site to stop ""deleting photos of people with self-harm scars"".
""None of these photos are doing harm, they in fact show there is life after self-harm, there is recovery, hope. By taking down these images you are telling all of them and others that their body is never going to be accepted."" 
She continued: ""This is directly hurting people in recovery who have come so far and deserve so much more respect from such a massive platform.""
The post has prompted people from as far afield as Australia to share their experiences of times when their own images have been censored.  
Aria Sandvik, who has scars on her arms following nine years of self-harm, said she has had two photos blurred recently, including one she was sharing with her followers to say she had not harmed herself for seven years. 
The 28-year-old, from Bergen in Norway, told the BBC: ""I post about self-harm because I don't want people to be ashamed of their scars. 
""I believe that when Instagram censors scars, they are saying that 'people do not want to see your scars', and that can be a massive slap in the face for people in recovery who are building up to showing off their skin again.""
Aria's image of her scars was blurred with the guidance, ""Sensitive content - This image contains sensitive content that anyone may experience as offensive or unpleasant"". 
Aria says that subsequent reposts of this image have not been censored by Instagram.

Within the same discussion, some people with a history of self-harm have said that they may be upset by seeing images of scars.
One male user wrote: ""Sometimes seeing people post their self-harm scars is a little triggering for me,"" but ""recovery should definitely be encouraged.""
While a woman from Oregon in the US made the distinction between ""purposely"" taken photos of scars and ""live your life"" images.  
""You're allowed to live your life normally with cuts and scars,"" she wrote. ""Direct pictures of self-harm cuts or scars should be deleted, but pictures of you living your life with them showing is different and should be allowed.""
The #youcantcensormyskin hashtag was started by 19-year-old Chloe Rose, from London, who has previously self-harmed. Until two years ago, she would ""never show"" her arms because of people staring at her or making ""horrible comments"", but she is now open about her skin and mental health. 
She says she aims to ""inspire others"" by ""being brave and talking"" about her struggles. She believes Instagram is ""forcing"" people with visible scars to ""hide"".   
Instagram has told the BBC that it does allow content relating to self-harm for the purpose of recovery, including healed scars. 
It says it aims to balance the need to remove harmful content speedily, but also allow people to use the platform in a positive and supportive way.  
Instagram says that if it makes a mistake and removes content which should not come down, then it works quickly to restore it.

Sixty new cases were reported in the past week, bringing this year's total to 971 cases in 26 US states - the highest since 1994.
The disease was declared effectively eliminated from the US in 2000.
Recent outbreaks have been attributed to foreign travellers spreading it to those lacking vaccinations in the US.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement on Thursday: ""If these outbreaks continue through summer and fall, the United States may lose its measles elimination status. 
""That loss would be a huge blow for the nation and erase the hard work done by all levels of public health. 
""The measles elimination goal, first announced in 1963 and accomplished in 2000, was a monumental task.""
The statement added that previously between three and four million Americans were diagnosed with the sometimes-fatal illness each year, leading to an estimated 400-500 deaths and 48,000 hospitalisations.
Earlier this year, Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases testified to lawmakers that more must be done to prevent the spread of the disease.
""I consider it an irony that you have one of the most contagious viruses known to man juxtaposed against one of the most effective vaccines they have,"" he said. 
""Yet we don't do and have not done what could be done - namely eliminate, eradicate the virus.""
This year's tally of 971 means the US has already broken the 1994 record - 963 infections - in only the first five months of 2019.

""I had my appendix out and I remember I came round out of the anaesthetic screaming, the pain was something else."" 
It was the start of a ""horrendous"" three years of investigation before ""they came to the conclusion through a process of elimination, it was nerve damage"".
Over the next 30 years, Alison had more than 50 injections, known as cryoblocks, to freeze the site of her abdominal pain, but none of them stopped the pain for more than six months. 
This left her needing high doses of painkillers which left her unable to eat or drink - and she ended up on a feeding tube which led to her losing weight, and her health deteriorating.   
But she says she always tried to stay positive, which was instilled in her by her mum.  
""No matter how bad things have been, I've always been able to find a positive at the end of the day. That isn't saying that I didn't have some very, very low moments.
""I miscarried seven times - six of which were definitely down to the pain. So not only have I paid the price - but also those potential lives."" 
She managed to have two children in the gaps between treatment, and now has three grandchildren. 
The eldest burst into tears the first time she saw Alison without an eating tube, ""as that, for her, wasn't normal granny"".
Five years ago, a cryoblock caused a collapsed lung, and Alison was referred to consultant neurosurgeon Girish Vajramani at the University Hospital Southampton. 
""Alison is one of the most challenging patients I have ever known,"" he says.  
""She had undergone 50 cryoblocks over 30 years, which is unprecedented, and resulted in her referral to me when this proved too dangerous.""
The team at Southampton fitted her with a stimulation implant along her spinal nerve, but it only reduced her pain by 50%. 
Alison went on to have 20 procedures to implant further electrodes, as well as correcting leads which had moved out of place.
She also had to wear a body brace for two years to try to keep the leads in position. 
With hyper-mobile joints, her body didn't make the right type of scar tissue to keep the electrodes in place. 
Trying to cuddle her new twin granddaughters while wearing the body brace was one of her lowest points, she says. 
After the medical team had exhausted all options available, they sought opinions from around the world, but the options were limited.
In a last-ditch attempt to get rid of her pain, Mr Vajramani inserted a paddle implant, combined with a spinal cord stimulator, to create a hybrid model. 
They were implanted in two operations in December 2018. 
""When they turned on the devices and they all worked, I don't know who had the biggest grin on their face - them or me,"" Alison says. 
Within five weeks she was off all her pain medication.
""I can't quite believe it and I can't believe what they did to get everything sorted,"" she says 
""I still can't stop grinning. I'm going around with a permanent Cheshire cat grin on my face because I just cannot believe it. 
""Because I was a 17-year-old, and now I'm a granny.""
Now 56, she says ""life is wonderful"" being pain-free, as she is finally ""able to eat and drink and enjoy the social side of life"".
And she hopes her story can ""give hope to others that no matter how long you face adversity, things can get better"".
She has a low-level buzz in her body and has to charge herself up twice a week by holding two different discs to parts of her body.  
""It's a standing joke that granny has to charge herself and there have been jokes about bionic granny,"" she says.

The report sets the ambition of recruiting an extra 40,000 nurses over the next five years.
It aims to do this through a combination of:
The plan for the link-up with Mumsnet has yet to be finalised, but is understood to involve promoting the opportunities that exist to go back to nursing.
A national return-to-practice scheme was set up in 2014 and is now being expanded. It offers catch-up training and a route back for nurses and support staff who have let their professional registrations lapse.
While the plan focuses heavily on nurses, it also acknowledges more doctors and support staff will also be needed.
It comes amid mounting concern about the number of vacancies in the health service.
The 40,000 nurses target would only be enough to fill the current number of unfilled nurse posts.
The plan sets a target of reducing the overall vacancy rate for all staff to 5% by 2028 - it is currently over 8%.
Dido Harding, chair of NHS Improvement, which is leading the work on the People Plan, said it was clear there were ""challenges"" with staff.
""I want front-line NHS staff to know we have heard their concerns about the pressures they face and we are determined to address them.
""The NHS needs more staff. But that, on its own, is not enough.
""We need to change the way people work in the NHS and create a modern, caring and exciting workplace.""
Health Secretary Matt Hancock added: ""We must make the NHS an employer to be proud of.""
But shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said that the plan was ""ducking the big challenges"".
He said the bursary for nursing students should be restored and legislation was needed to ensure safe staffing levels on wards.
Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation think tank, said staffing was the ""make or break issue for the NHS"".
But she said health leaders were operating with ""one hand tied behind their back"", as it was not yet clear how the plan would be funded.
Patricia Marquis, of the Royal College of Nursing, added: ""This document begins to tackle the real issues but many will reserve final judgement until funding levels and practical details are revealed.""

Andy Ruiz Jr's astonishing win against Anthony Joshua looks like a victory for anyone who's been mocked for carrying a bit too much timber.
To the untrained eye, the Mexican certainly looked hopelessly out of shape - with slo-mo replays merely highlighting his wobbly torso.
But Newsbeat's been finding out how all that fat might actually help you fight.
""In a sport like heavyweight boxing there are certainly scenarios where carrying extra body fat can be beneficial,"" says sports nutritionist Dr Mayur Ranchordas.
He's worked with anyone from pro-boxers Gavin and Jamie McDonnell to diver Tom Daley - and says it's all about recognising the delicate balance between muscle, fat and fitness.
""When we train athletes in the lab the first thing we do is measure their body composition - how much muscle mass they are carrying and how much fat mass they have around it. 
""If you want to become a good cyclist, extra body fat is of no use whatsoever because that additional weight doesn't translate into performance. In boxing it can.
""If you're an extra 20 kilograms heavier - even if that weight is coming from fat - the opponent is going to feel your punch a lot more,"" he explains.
So extra weight can enhance power. But, of course, there is a trade off: fitness and agility.
""If you are carrying extra body fat then your heart rate is going to be higher and you're going to have to use more energy to move around.""
Before a fight boxers go into training camps where, usually, the aim is to lose fat mass and increase muscle mass. 
To tone up, basically.
But Dr Ranchordas says - as long as an athlete is fit enough to handle the extra weight - the fat can be helpful.
""If your ability to produce speed is great, your punching power is phenomenal and your fitness levels are very, very good - getting you to lose an extra 15 kilos of fat is probably not going to help.""
And that brings us back to Ruiz.
""Ruiz is carrying a lot of body fat - but don't get me wrong he's carrying a lot of muscle mass at the same time. He's not just a fat blob.
""So how does he differ from an overweight guy down the street? That guy might weigh the same - but underneath the fat he's carrying nowhere near as much muscle.""

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48496652,"The first people to be gene-edited - a pair of baby twin girls - may have been mutated in a way that shortens life expectancy, research suggests. 
Prof He Jiankui shocked the world when he genetically altered the twins to try to give them protection against HIV. 
But a study in Nature Medicine shows people who naturally have the mutation he was trying to recreate were significantly more likely to die young.
Experts said Prof He's actions were ""very dangerous"" and ""foolish"". 
Prof He was targeting a gene called CCR5. 
It is a set of genetic instructions that are important for how the immune system functions. 
However, they are also the doorway that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) walks through to infect cells. 
Mutations to CCR5 essentially lock the door and give people resistance to HIV. 
So, Prof He made embryos in an IVF clinic and then used gene-editing technologies on them to alter the CCR5 gene. 
The resulting girls - known as Lulu and Nana - were born last year. 
The problem is CCR5 has a bigger role in the body than just making people vulnerable to HIV.
It is active in the brain and in fighting off other infections, particularly flu.
The study, at the University of California, Berkeley, looked at nearly 410,000 people in the UK. 
It showed those who had only the mutated version of CCR5 were 20% more likely to die before they turned 78.
""In this case, it is probably not a mutation that most people would want to have,"" said Prof Rasmus Nielsen, from UC Berkeley.
""You are actually, on average, worse off having it."" 
Fellow researcher Dr Xinzhu Wei said the gene-editing technology, known as Crispr, was still too risky to be using on children.
""The Crispr technology is far too dangerous to use right now for germ-line editing,"" she said. 
The implications for Lulu and Nana are still unclear. 
""It is impossible to predict if the mutations carried by the twin girls will have any effect,"" said Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Institute.
Not everyone who carried the mutations in the study died young but it was more likely.
And life expectancy depends on a complex mix of the DNA you are born with and the world you live in. 
To further complicate things, Prof He mutated CCR5 in a similar rather than identical way to people who have HIV resistance. 
Prof Lovell-Badge said the study ""shows once more that He Jiankui was foolish to choose CCR5 to mutate"".
There was universal condemnation by scientists when Prof He made the announcement in November. 
Some described the experiment as ""monstrous"".
And he was criticised for experimenting when the risks to otherwise healthy children were unclear and for acting against Chinese law.
There was also anger because HIV can be treated and there was barely any risk of it being passed from the HIV-positive father to his children.
The Chinese authorities investigated and concluded that Prof He had acted illegally in pursuit of ""fame and fortune"".
Prof He has always defended his experiments and at a summit in Hong Kong said he was ""proud"" of his gene-editing work.

Recently, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey hit the headlines when he claimed to eat just one meal a day. Social media was abuzz, with many critics calling it an extreme diet. But perhaps he was just following the latest trend. 
According to a survey by the International Food Information Council Foundation intermittent fasting (IF) was last year's most popular diet. 
Intermittent fasting can take many different forms but it always involves periods of time where you are taking in very little food, at regular intervals.
Fans of intermittent fasting claim it's a good way to lose weight, and a summary of studies into the method, published in the Annual Review of Nutrition in 2017, found that 11 out of 16 trials reported some weight loss. 
''The reason for that is simple mathematics, as you are restricting calories,'' says Dr Linia Patel, a registered dietician and spokeswoman for the British Dietician Association.
However, the study found that some patterns of fasting were not advisable: alternate-day fasting led to intense hunger and was therefore considered impractical.
Fasting has been practised throughout history for religious, cultural and spiritual reasons, but as a way of eating it goes back much further.
Dr Patel explains that if we look at our ancestors, they had periods of enforced fasting. Hunter-gatherers only had food when they killed or collected it, so fasting was part of their everyday reality.  
But nowadays we are constantly exposed to plentiful foods. We also lead far less active lives. Together, these factors have caused an obesity epidemic.
Simply telling people to eat a healthy, balanced diet doesn't seem to work, according to Dr Patel. 
""People love rules,"" she says. ""I think bringing in a little discipline and having periods where we are not eating is a positive thing."" 
Unlike most diets, IF doesn't exclude specific food groups, such as fat, sugars or carbohydrates.  All you need is a clock. Perhaps that is part of its appeal. 
For Shanae Dennis, a 26-year-old journalist, it was the simplicity that appealed.  
""I started intermittent fasting because I really wanted a quick, simple and easy diet. Being told to just eat between 12 and 8pm was really easy to follow so I was interested."" 
""In the beginning I thought I could really eat whatever I want, but soon I realised that for it to work I had to eat healthily,"" says Shanae.
This is a common misconception, says Dr Patel. 
""In my clinical practice I find that a lot of people are not doing intermittent fasting properly,"" she says. ""For example they might keep the calories below 500 on fasting days but then they go and feast on the other days.
''That's dangerous from two points of view: you are not going to get the calorie deficit and lose weight. You need to eat sensibly."" 
So it's not a feast and famine thing. That's not going to work.
In order for it to be a safe, effective and healthy way of eating, the food consumed during ""eating windows"" needs to be of high nutritional value. 
Scientists emphasise that those on IF diets should include essential fats from oily fish, nuts and seeds, lean sources of protein, whole-grains and starchy carbohydrates and plenty of fruit and vegetables to supply enough dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals. 
Calorie-controlled diets all have a similar impact on weight loss, but the diet that is really successful is one that people can sustain in the long-term. 
One of the difficulties with sticking to a diet is craving forbidden foods, and with IF that is perhaps less of a problem. 
""When I am on a no-carbohydrate or low carbohydrate diet all I see is pasta and rice everywhere, but now I don't crave certain food groups because nothing is restricted,"" says Shanae. 
She has been following the 16:8 diet for four months now and finds it easier to keep up than the 5:2 diet, during which she gets very hungry. 
""The hardest thing is to not reach for the breakfast muffin,"" says Shanae.
Imahn Robertson, 26, has been following an IF diet for over four years. 
""When I first started I did struggle, the body naturally craves foods at all times. But after I got into a routine it was okay,"" says Imahn. 
""There is temptation, don't get me wrong. If I am tempted I will occasionally break my fast and adjust my fasting period the next day."" 
However, Imahn admits that her diet has affected her social life. 
""I only eat between 12 and 8pm - if someone schedules a dinner for nine o'clock, I will go to the dinner but just drink water.
""What makes it difficult is that people are very judgemental,"" she says. ""I find it easier to do intermittent fasting when I am single, not when I am in a relationship."" 
Freelance cameraman Colum O'Dwyer, 27, has been practising IF for a couple of years now. He eats two large meals a day, between 12 and 8pm. 
""I like the discipline that comes with it,"" says Colum. ""It gives me a structure which is sorely needed when you manage your own time.
""I feel I'm always at risk of procrastinating by having overly elaborate breakfasts or lunches, so going from three meals a day to two frees up time and allows for greater productivity."" 
For Colum it's also important to minimise sugar, to avoid a sugar rush - and subsequent crash.  
Dr Patel says that mood swings - caused by a change in insulin levels - can be a consequence of fasting, depending on what you are used to eating. 
""If you have a diet that is very high in refined carbohydrates and you snack a lot, of course fasting is going to mean that you will be irritable,"" says Dr Patel.
 IF can be unsuitable for people with certain health conditions.
People with advanced diabetes, history of eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, those suffering from chronic diseases and pregnant or breastfeeding women should not attempt intermittent fasting. Fasting should not be attempted unless they are under the close supervision of a physician. 
People who have stomach ulcers, should not fast either.
This kind of dieting has gained popularity in the last 10 years or so, but it has not been around for long enough to prove that it's any better or worse than other diets, says Dr Patel. 
""We don't have massive trials but the evidence in this area is increasing. It's not black and white yet but what we are seeing from the existing human studies that we have is that there are positive attributes when done properly.""",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48509969,"Cases of sexually transmitted infections are increasing in England.
In 2018, there were 447,694 new diagnoses of STIs, a 5% increase on the 422,147 in 2017. 
Gonorrhoea increased the most - by 26% to 56,259 cases, the largest number since 1978.
There were 7,541 cases of syphilis - a 5% increase on 2017.
High-risk groups include young people and men who have sex with men.
The most commonly diagnosed STIs were:
The number of gonorrhoea cases has been increasing for years among both men and women, despite repeated warnings from public health doctors about the risks of unprotected sex. 
Sometimes referred to as ""the clap"", it is a bacterial infection passed between people through unprotected sex. 
Sex, condoms and having that chat with a new partner
It is not spread by toilet seats or sharing baths or towels. 
Some people have no symptoms but can pass it on to their sexual partner. 
It can be treated with antibiotics, although there have been recent reports of some cases of hard-to-treat ""super-gonorrhoea"" that are resistant to the usual choice of drugs.
People with any of the symptoms of gonorrhoea - a yellow or green discharge from the vagina or penis, or pain urinating - should visit their GP or a sexual health clinic for a test. 
Gonorrhoea can cause serious long-term health problems, including infertility in women. 
Experts are worried that many people are not getting tested for STIs when they should be.
Some may be too embarrassed to seek help - but cuts to services are also a concern.
Dr Gwenda Hughes, from Public Health England, said: ""The rise in sexually transmitted infections is concerning. 
""No matter what age you are, or what type of relationship you are in, it's important to look after your sexual health. If you have sex with a new or casual partner, make sure you use condoms and get regularly tested.""
Dr Olwen Williams, president of British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said sexual health services were at breaking point. 
""Recent years have unfortunately seen severe and damaging cuts to sexual health service funding, jeopardising our ability to meet these challenges at a critical time,"" she said. 
""The continuing escalation in gonorrhoea and syphilis diagnoses must be addressed as an urgent health priority, otherwise there is the potential for devastating consequences to the wellbeing of the wider population and the health system as a whole.""
Screening for chlamydia continued to decline in 2018, with just over 1.3 million young people tested.
Meanwhile, new cases of genital warts continued to decline.
Experts say this is due to the HPV vaccine - a jab offered to teenage girls (and soon boys too) and some adults in high-risk groups to protect against some strains of human papilomavirus, which are also linked to cervical cancer.",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48495313,"A ""pumping"" patch containing millions of living, beating stem cells could help repair the damage caused by a heart attack, according to researchers. 
Sewn on to the heart, the 3cm (1in) by 2cm patch, grown in a lab from a sample of the patient's own cells, then turns itself into healthy working muscle.
It also releases chemicals that repair and regenerate existing heart cells.
Tests in rabbits show it appears safe, Imperial College London experts told a leading heart conference in Manchester. 
Patient trials should start in the next two years, the British Cardiovascular Society meeting heard.
A heart attack happens when a clogged artery blocks blood flow to the heart muscle, starving it of oxygen and nutrients. 
This can damage the heart's pumping power and lead to incurable heart failure. 
Heart failure affects about 920,000 people in the UK. 
Researcher Dr Richard Jabbour said: ""One day, we hope to add heart patches to the treatments that doctors can routinely offer people after a heart attack. 
""We could prescribe one of these patches alongside medicines for someone with heart failure, which you could take from a shelf and implant straight in to a person.""
Prof Metin Avkiran, from the British Heart Foundation, which funded the research, said: ""Heart failure is a debilitating and life-changing condition with no cure, making everyday tasks incredibly difficult. 
""If we can patch the heart up and help it heal, we could transform the outlook for these people.""",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-48252939,"When Elly Kitaly gave birth to her son she found out he had Down's syndrome. She realised that the condition was so ignored in her country, Tanzania, that there was not even an adequate word in her language, Swahili. 
This is Elly's account of her journey to find out why.
Waiting for an internal flight at Dar es Salaam's airport, a young accountant started making conversation with me. 
""Why are you flying to Arusha?"" he asked.
I told him I was going to meet a friend I had made on Instagram. She is a mother, like me. Her son is four, like mine, and just like my son Chadron, he has Down's syndrome.
""What's Down's syndrome?"" he asked.
This is a question I get often in Tanzania. It doesn't matter how educated you are, no-one seems to know what it is.
I geared myself up to give my well-practised explanation.
I wanted to switch into our language, Swahili, but I knew I had to keep to English because there isn't a good-enough word for Down's syndrome in Swahili. 
Mlimbuko dalili dumazi - this term is used in the Swahili dictionary for disabled people but I never hear anyone use it in real life. Doctors aren't even aware of it. ""Dumazi"" translates as dwarf and I have a suspicion that is because that is a translation of the word down - as in down low or short. This is a mistranslation because, while one of the symptoms can be stunted growth, Down's syndrome actually gets its name from the doctor who first observed all its characteristics together - John Langdon Down. 
Taahira - this is the term I hear used most often. Its English equivalent is retard. Just like retard it is a highly offensive insult. But unlike in English, it hasn't been replaced by a term like ""learning disability"". Other insults with a similar meaning are ""mazazeta"" and ""zuzu"".
Mtindio wa ubongo - this is the most socially acceptable term and you'll hear officials use it, but it isn't accurate as it means cerebral palsy. 
Ndondocha - this slang loosely means zombie, as in someone who has been possessed. It refers to the belief that witch doctors can cast spells to make people mentally disabled. It can also be used to mean someone who has been cursed by their ancestors.
My language is a reflection of my country - it can sometime feel like Down's syndrome (DS) doesn't exist in Tanzania.
Take my fellow passenger at the airport.
I explained to him that there are some common physical signs of DS, like slanted eyes and a flat nose. 
He looked blank. So I showed him pictures and he said he hadn't seen people like this before. 
We boarded our flight and the conversation came to an end but it got me thinking. 
Looking back, I realised that growing up, I'd never seen a person with DS either. Not at school, not in the market, and not at church.
I was barely aware of the condition until I gave birth to my own son. 
I remember frantically Googling it in my hospital bed. 
Listen to Don't Hide My Son, on The Documentary, on the BBC World Service, on 4 June

I learnt that the most common form of Down's syndrome is trisomy 21, trisomy meaning third chromosome. You can think of chromosomes as the instruction manuals for how to build your body. It's typical to have 23 instruction manuals, each in duplicate, but people with trisomy 21 have an extra, third, copy of manual 21.
Crucially, I learnt that this extra chromosome comes about as a result of random events during the development of the embryo, egg or sperm cells. 
If it's random, it can occur just as much in Tanzania as any other country. 
Given that, why hadn't I, or my new accountant friend, seen anyone with DS in public?
With this question in mind, I arrived in Arusha and met my Instagram friend, Magreth Paschal, for the first time in real life.
As we sat at her home admiring her plants from her floristry business, she told me the first she had heard of the condition was when her son was diagnosed. 
Like me, she hadn't seen people with DS at all when she was growing up. 
She suspected that this was because parents had been shamed into hiding their children. 
The reason she held this suspicion was because of something that happened to her when her son Jotham was a baby. 
A customer of hers had made a shocking accusation in a text message.
She'd kept the message and read it out loud to me: ""Shame on you for going to the witch doctor and sacrificing your son just so that you can get rich.""
I had heard of this idea before because I had been told that people had said similar things about me. 
It's a complicated belief to get your head around.
Some people in Tanzania think that people have DS because their parents have gone to the witch doctor to cast a spell to make themselves rich and have given their own child's mental capabilities as a sacrifice. 
Magreth was incredibly sad that someone would make such an accusation about her. 
""After I received the text, I couldn't even continue to feed the baby. I just cried and cried. It was the worst experience of my life.""
When she went out to the park with her son she started noticing people staring at her. 
""Back then I was not comfortable to go out in public with my son because some people looked at me as if I'm a sinful person,"" she told me.
She felt people judging her most when she was driving with Jotham in the car - in a town where many people couldn't ever dream of owning a car in their lifetime.
""That's when you give them the answer that you have used your son for the money ritual.""
Sitting across from Magreth, I was filled with anger. I found myself shouting: ""I want the world to know that we did not go to the witchdoctor. 
""That isn't how we ended up with children with Down's syndrome.""
While the accusations made against parents are outrageous, if those parents do give in to the shame and hide their children, the consequences are heartbreaking. 
By locking their children away, these parents are denying them the opportunity to socialise and learn.
Source: Global Down Syndrome Foundation 
Tanzanian organisations working with people with DS include: The Pearl of People with Down Syndrome foundation and Chadron's Hope Foundation.
The condition can lead to smaller stature and a learning disability. But our children with DS do learn, it just takes a bit longer.
Magreth and I have a shared love for videos on social media that prove this.
There was one that blew my mind and I couldn't wait to to tell her about - US actor and campaigner with DS, Frank Stephens' speech at congress had gone viral.
I had never seen someone with DS speak as eloquently as him before. I got in touch with Frank to ask him what circumstances had led him to be such an accomplished public speaker.
He was clear - it was a result of his parents involving him in everything when he was growing up.
Locking up children isn't just restricting their opportunities. It can actually create more disabilities.
One physiotherapist, Godfrey Kimathy, told me when he was working in Magreth's region he found a seven-year-old girl who couldn't walk or talk or go to the toilet, not because she had DS but because she had been locked up her whole life.
Her parents had locked their daughter up because their neighbours believed they had made her that way in order to become rich. 
But Godfrey said he couldn't even see the wealth that the neighbours were talking about. 
Magreth went down a different route - she became defiant against this stigma.
She now takes Jotham everywhere and by doing so she hopes to change her world.
And I want to change my world too by proposing the introduction of a new Swahili term - ""Traisomi ishirini na moja"" it's a direct translation of trisomy 21 - that extra chromosome.",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48528058,"Doctors and the public are at odds over the symptoms of constipation, leaving some people without the advice or treatment they need, researchers say.
While medics think infrequent bowel movements are an important sign, less than a third of the public does, a study found.
The King's College London team said a new definition for constipation was needed, based on patient experiences.
""This shows the poo taboo is over,"" charity Guts UK said.
Constipation is a very common condition, affecting around one in seven people who are otherwise healthy.
It means having difficultly opening or emptying the bowels, and passing stools - but the way it is diagnosed varies widely.
The researchers say this list of six groups of symptoms could help form a new definition of constipation:
The researchers surveyed 2,557 members of the public, 411 GPs and 365 gastroenterology specialists and published the results in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.
They found that what most people think of as symptoms of constipation aren't included in any official diagnostic criteria.
These include:
While most people who said they had constipation had symptoms that matched the official criteria, one in three 'healthy' patients didn't recognise their symptoms of constipation at all.
And doctors and the public don't seem to agree on the signs to look out for either, the study found.
Medics placed lots of emphasis on infrequent bowel movements, as a symptom, but only half of people who said they had constipation actually experienced this symptom.
Dr Eirini Dimidi, study author from King's College London, said: ""Our research may indicate that people who seek help for symptoms of constipation don't always have them recognised, diagnosed or managed.""
She said constipation was usually caused by a lack of fibre or fluid in the diet but it could also be a sign of another underlying problem, such as bowel cancer, diverticular disease or coeliac disease.
Dr Dimidi said it was ""always important to consult your doctor if you experience gut symptoms"".
Listening to what patients say about constipation is important, said Julie Harrington, from charity Guts UK.
""Patients are the experts, by experience, and when they come together with specialists, that's the sweet spot.""
Not all constipation is the same, and different people have different symptoms, she added.
""Bowel problems are less likely to be picked up than other problems because people wait 6-12 months out of fear and embarrassment. 
""You have to tune into your body."" 
This is difficult to answer - it can vary dramatically from person to person.
In the study, seven bowel movements a week was the average among people who weren't constipated.
But experts say three bowel movements a day to three a week qualifies as normal.
So you need to know what's normal for you - and then look out for changes. 
Most people recognise the problem themselves and try to solve it by increasing the fibre in their diet and drinking more fluid, according to NHS advice. 
Fibre is present in wholegrain bread, wholegrain pasta, fruit, nuts, pulses and cereals.
Taking more exercise and eating regular meals can also help. 
You can buy laxatives from the chemist if diet and lifestyle changes aren't working.
But it's important to see your GP if the problem persists, and you have other symptoms.",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48527798,"The ultimate limit of human endurance has been worked out by scientists analysing a 3,000 mile run, the Tour de France and other elite events.
They showed the cap was 2.5 times the body's resting metabolic rate, or 4,000 calories a day for an average person.
Anything higher than that was not sustainable in the long term.
The research, by Duke University, also showed pregnant women were endurance specialists, living at nearly the limit of what the human body can cope with.
The study started with the Race Across the USA in which athletes ran 3,080 miles from California to Washington DC in 140 days.
Competitors were running six marathons a week for months, and scientists were investigating the effect on their bodies. 
Resting metabolic rate - the calories the body burns through when it is relaxing - was recorded before and during the race.
And calories burned in the extreme endurance event were recorded.
The study, in Science Advances, showed energy use started off high but eventually levelled off at 2.5 times the resting metabolic rate.
The study found a pattern between the length of a sporting event and energy expenditure - the longer the event, the harder it is to burn through the calories. 
So people can go far beyond their base metabolic rate while doing a short bout of exercise, it becomes unsustainable in the long term. 
The study also shows that while running a marathon may be beyond many, it is nowhere near the limit of human endurance. 
""You can do really intense stuff for a couple of days, but if you want to last longer then you have to dial it back,"" Dr Herman Pontzer, from Duke University, told BBC News.
He added: ""Every data point, for every event, is all mapped onto this beautifully crisp barrier of human endurance. 
""Nobody we know of has ever pushed through it."" 
Can exercise reverse the ageing process?
During pregnancy, women's energy use peaks at 2.2 times their resting metabolic rate, the study showed.
The researchers argue the 2.5 figure may be down to the human digestive system, rather than anything to do with the heart, lungs or muscles. 
They found the body cannot digest, absorb and process enough calories and nutrients to sustain a higher level of energy use.
The body can use up its own resources burning through fat or muscle mass  - which can be recovered afterwards - in shorter events.
But in extreme events - at the limits of human exhaustion - the body has to balance its energy use, the researchers argue.
Dr Pontzer said the findings could eventually help athletes.
""In the Tour de France, knowing where your ceiling is allows you to pace yourself smartly.
""Secondly, we're talking about endurance over days and weeks and months, so it is most applicable to training regimens and thinking whether they fit with the long-term metabolic limits of the body.""

The 39-year-old, who has two boys of her own, has carried surrogate babies three times for two other couples.
She told BBC Scotland's The Nine: ""There are so many heartbreaking stories of people who have gone through things like stillbirth, miscarriages or cancers that have left them infertile or unable to carry. I just thought 'I want to help someone'.""
Ms Kelly, from Glenrothes in Fife, said she had to explain to her own sons that the other women's ""tummies were broken and they couldn't carry a baby"". 
""The boys have always known they are not coming home with that baby, it's someone else's baby,"" she said.
Surrogacy comes in two forms - gestational, where the surrogate mother is implanted with an egg and sperm; and traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate's own egg is used.
It is legal in the UK but experts say the laws are outdated and need to be improved.
In particular, reform bodies think the intended parents should become legal parents as soon as the child is born.
Currently it involves a lengthy court process to get the required Parental Order.
Ms Kelly, whose surrogate children were from the intended mother's eggs, said it often took several months for the order to be granted.
""Until that goes through I would be still responsible for that child in the eyes of the law,"" she says.
Ms Kelly adds: ""Watching the baby being born and watching the couple's faces when they realise they've become parents, it's magical. 
""It's so rewarding to see them with their family that grew inside me. I see them as miracle babies.""
That would be the case for Niomi Allan, from Wishaw in North Lanarkshire, who was diagnosed at the age of 16 with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.
""I was born without a womb,"" she says.
""I have always known that surrogacy is the only route to having our own biological children.""
Niomi, 27, says she suppressed the fact when she was a teenager but when she got married ""it really hit home"".
With her partner Sam, Niomi has now embarked on a ""rollercoaster"" journey towards surrogacy.
She says: ""We've fortunately found a surrogate who is looking to carry for us.
""We had to go through our own IVF, which we did here in Scotland, then flew over for egg retrieval in the Czech Republic and we created embryos that are frozen over there ready for our surrogate to go over.
""We've been over for our first transfer but unfortunately it failed this time for us, so hopefully we'll go back out soon for another.""
In the UK, the number of parental orders made following a surrogate birth has tripled from 121 in 2011 to 368 in 2018. 
The true number of surrogacy arrangements may be even higher as there is no obligation to seek such an order.
Niomi said: ""We have to put in a parental order to make sure it is myself and my husband who go on the birth certificate.
""Six weeks after a baby is born to six months you can apply for parental order and then it takes a wee while after that for it to be granted.
""It will be our biological child so it is important it is us on the birth certificate to begin with.""
The Law Commission of England and Wales as well as the Scottish Law Commission are proposing to allow intended parents to become legal parents when the child is born.
This would be subject to the surrogate retaining a right to object for a short period after the birth.
And they have called for the creation of a regulator to oversee surrogacy agreements and a national register to allow the children to access information about their origins.
The commissions also said there was a lack of clarity around surrogacy payments. 
The law currently permits intended parents to pay ""reasonable expenses"" to the surrogate, however this is unclear and difficult to apply in practice.

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48542403,"One million new sexually transmitted infections (STIs) occur every single day, the World Health Organization has estimated.
That means more than 376 million new cases annually of four infections - chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis, and syphilis.
The WHO highlights a lack of progress in stopping the spread of STIs, and says its figures are a ""wake-up call"".
Experts are particularly concerned about the rise in drug-resistant STIs.
The WHO regularly evaluates the global impact of the four common sexually transmitted infections.
It looks at published research and collects reports from its workers in countries around the world.
Compared with its last analysis in 2012, the WHO reports ""no substantive decline"" in the rates of new or existing infections. 
It suggests around one in 25 people globally has at least one of these four STIs, with some experiencing multiple infections at the same time.
The figures suggest that among people aged 15-49 in 2016 there were: 
Trichomoniasis is caused by infection by a parasite during sex. Chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhoea are bacterial infections.
STI symptoms can include discharge, pain urinating and bleeding between periods. However, many cases have no symptoms.
Serious complications can include pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women from chlamydia and gonorrhoea, and cardiovascular and neurological disease from syphilis. 
If a woman contracts an STI when she's pregnant, it can lead to stillbirth, premature birth, low birth-weight and health problems for the baby including pneumonia, blindness and congenital deformities.
Dr Peter Salama, of the WHO, said: ""We're seeing a concerning lack of progress in stopping the spread of sexually transmitted infections worldwide.
""This is a wake-up call for a concerted effort to ensure everyone, everywhere can access the services they need to prevent and treat these debilitating diseases.""
Practising safe sex, particularly through condom use, and better access to testing are both crucial, the WHO says.
In terms of treatment, bacterial STIs can be treated and cured with widely available medications. 
But syphilis treatment has been made more difficult because of a shortage in the specific kind of penicillin needed, and there has been an increase in cases of so-called ""super-gonorrhoea"" which is almost impossible to treat.
Dr Tim Jinks, head of Wellcome's Drug Resistant Infection programme, said: ""Untreatable cases of gonorrhoea are harbingers of a wider crisis, where common infections are harder and harder to treat. 
""We urgently need to reduce the spread of these infections and invest in new antibiotics and treatments to replace those that no longer work.""",,,,

She is one of a number of women whose lives have been turned upside down after having a contraceptive implant inserted into their fallopian tubes.
The Essure implant is designed to stop eggs reaching the womb.
It was removed from the UK market in 2017. Its manufacturer, Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, said the decision was ""purely commercial"".
As of January, selling and distributing Essure was banned in America, after restrictions were imposed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
However, healthcare providers can still implant Essure up to one year from the device's date of purchase.
Before it was discontinued, many women experienced severe pain and discomfort, and many of them still do.
Alana Nesbitt, 39, from west Belfast, said the implant ""feels like there's a knife inside you - it's awful"".
The mother-of-two says the pain started a few months after she had the coils fitted in 2012. She initially went to her doctor with suspected appendix pain, but was later referred to the gynaecology department.
She is now on an NHS waiting list for a hysterectomy, when she will finally have the implant removed.
""It's really hard to take in,"" she told BBC News NI.
""You grow up thinking that Mother Nature will eventually get you to the menopause, but you don't ever think that will be taken from you.

""Leaning down can be sore, walking can be crippling sometimes and I've ended up in A&E so many times because of the pain.""
The small implants are inserted into the fallopian tubes where they trigger inflammation, causing scar tissue to build up and eventually block the tubes, known as a hysteroscopic sterilisation.
""The pain would be like being stabbed from the inside out, electric shocks, being pregnant without being pregnant - I wouldn't wish it on anybody,"" Ms Speers told BBC News NI.
""It's kept quiet, brushed under the carpet, but sterilisation is the worst thing I've ever done. My mental health has just gone down the toilet.""
There have been a small number of incident reports for patients in Northern Ireland, according to a Department of Health (DoH) spokesperson.
The DoH said it advised health and social care trusts that Essure had lost its CE certificate in 2017 and asked trusts to quarantine existing stock and suspend the use of the product.
""Patient safety is the department's highest priority and we encourage the reporting of any adverse incidents with medical devices to Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre regardless of how long ago the implant was inserted,"" it said.
The manufacturer did not seek to renew its CE marking - which demonstrates a product's conformity with European health, safety and environmental standards - after regulatory concerns were raised by the European Union.
But Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, which manufactured the product, told BBC News NI that women who still have the implants in place ""may continue to confidently rely on the device"".
In a statement, the company added: ""The benefit-risk profile of Essure has not changed, and we continue to stand behind the product's safety and efficacy, which are demonstrated by an extensive body of research, undertaken by Bayer and independent medical researchers, involving more than 200,000 women over the past two decades.""
Kelly George, from Crossgar in County Down, got the Essure implant in March 2014, after the birth of her youngest son. She has since found out that she is allergic to nickel, which the Essure implant contains.
""I was fine initially but then I started getting night sweats and within a few weeks my skin started flaring up,"" she told BBC News NI.
""I've had really bad brain fog too - I'm on another planet and I was never like that before. It's one of the main symptoms that people complain about.""
Ms George had her fallopian tubes removed in November and underwent a hysterectomy last Friday.
""It has badly affected my life - I'll be glad to see the back of it all.""",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48547983,"The world is entering ""a new phase"" where big outbreaks of deadly diseases like Ebola are a ""new normal"", the World Health Organization has warned. 
Previous Ebola outbreaks affected relatively small numbers of people. 
But the Democratic Republic of Congo is dealing with the second largest outbreak ever, just three years after the world's largest one ended.
The WHO said countries and other bodies needed to focus on preparing for new deadly epidemics. 
There have been 2,025 cases of Ebola and 1,357 deaths from the virus during the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
The largest outbreak, in West Africa in 2014-16 affected 28,616 people mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. There were 11,310 deaths.
Yet the 12 outbreaks between 2000 and 2010 averaged fewer than 100 cases.
So why are modern outbreaks so much bigger?
""We are entering a very new phase of high impact epidemics and this isn't just Ebola,"" Dr Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme told me.
He said the world is ""seeing a very worrying convergence of risks"" that are increasing the dangers of diseases including Ebola, cholera and yellow fever.
He said climate change, emerging diseases, exploitation of the rainforest, large and highly mobile populations, weak governments and conflict were making outbreaks more likely to occur and more likely to swell in size once they did.
Dr Ryan said the World Health Organization was tracking 160 disease events around the world and nine were grade three emergencies (the WHO's highest emergency level). 
""I don't think we've ever had a situation where we're responding to so many emergencies at one time. This is a new normal, I don't expect the frequency of these events to reduce.""
As a result, he argued that countries and other bodies needed to ""get to grips with readiness [and] be ready for these epidemics"". 
The outbreak in DR Congo continues to worry health officials. 
It took 224 days for the number of cases to reach 1,000, but just a further 71 days to reach 2,000.
Tackling the disease has been complicated by conflict in the region - between January and May there were more than 40 attacks on health facilities. 
Another problem is distrust of healthcare workers with about a third of deaths being in the community. It means people are not seeking treatment and risk spreading the disease to neighbours and relatives.
Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust, said the world needed to get better at preparing for such outbreaks. 
""With Ebola in West Africa, that was the mobility of people and porous borders - that is now the world we live in, that won't stop,"" she said.
Climate change could lead to more outbreaks like cholera in Mozambique after Cyclone Idai, she said. But she hoped diseases resulting from humanitarian crises would not be a new normal. 
""Preparedness needs to be better, we can see movement of populations and climate change, a lot of this we can see coming, and we need more resources to plan and prepare.""

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48580037,"Hundreds of UK men are trying out a new screening test for prostate cancer to see if it should eventually be offered routinely on the NHS. 
The test is a non-invasive MRI scan that takes images of the inside of the body to check for any abnormal growths. 
Scientists running the trial say it will take a few years to know if MRI will be better than available blood tests and biopsies at spotting cancers. 
NHS England said it would review this ""potentially exciting"" development.
The UK currently doesn't offer routine screening because there is no reliable test. 
A blood test, called PSA, can check for high levels of a protein that can sometimes indicate that the person might have prostate cancer, but it is not always accurate. 
About three in four men with a raised PSA level will not have cancer and the test can also miss more than one in 10 cancers. 
Men with a raised PSA may need more checks, such as a biopsy. This involves taking small samples of tissue from the prostate gland, using a needle, so that they can be examined under the microscope. 
In some cases, this can miss a cancer that is there, fail to spot whether it is aggressive, and cause side-effects, including bleeding, serious infections and erectile dysfunction.
MRI is non-invasive. It might be a way to make prostate cancer testing more reliable and maybe even do away with the need for biopsies altogether, researchers hope.
A recent UK trial in men with high PSA levels showed more than a quarter could be spared invasive biopsies.
The experts from University College London who are running the screening trial hope MRI will detect serious cancers earlier while reassuring the majority of men that they don't have cancer. 
Prof Mark Emberton and colleagues say MRI is a good tool because it is relatively cheap, widely available and reliable. 
Men found to have possible signs of cancer on the scan would be sent for more tests.
Prostate cancer kills about 11,800 men each year in the UK.
It usually develops slowly so there may be no signs or symptoms for many years. 
The prostate is a small gland that sits underneath the bladder and surrounds the urethra - the tube men urinate through. 
The chances of developing prostate cancer increase with age. Most cases develop in men aged 50 or older.
Men whose father or brother was affected by prostate cancer are at slightly increased risk themselves.
For many men with prostate cancer, treatment is not immediately necessary - doctors may suggest watchful waiting or surveillance.
More aggressive prostate cancer will need immediate treatment, which includes surgery and radiotherapy.
Co-researcher Prof Caroline Moore said: ""We know that at the moment around 6,000 men a year are diagnosed with late-stage cancer, where it is not curable. 
""And we know that if we could detect those men at an earlier stage, where it would be curable, we would be in a much better position. 
""The finer details are why we need this first study to work things out.""
An NHS England official said: ""NHS England is already rolling out some of the latest developments in MRI scanning for prostate cancer diagnosis and care. 
""This new test is potentially an exciting development that the NHS will look at as more evidence becomes available.""
Karen Stalbow, from Prostate Cancer UK, said: ""This trial could provide an exciting step towards our ambition for a national screening programme that enables men to get the early prostate cancer diagnosis that can save more lives.
""If the results are positive, then MRI scanning could offer a non-invasive first stage of prostate cancer diagnosis in the future.
""Anything that offers men an easy and more effective way to be checked for prostate cancer is a good thing and we await the results with interest.""",,,,

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-48582027,"Giving blood is something that comes with a lot of rules.
But there are also a lot of myths and half-truths that people believe. 
The number of men giving blood has dropped by 24.8% over the past five years, and the number of women giving blood has dropped by 6%, according to NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT). 
They're asking for more donors - and the chances are you're eligible. 
So what actually are the rules around giving blood? 
Myths around blood donation are something NHSBT is used to dealing with - and a few years ago a survey was commissioned to find out what misconceptions people had. 
It found that 3% of the more than 2,000 adults they asked thought being vegetarian could stop people from donating. 
The concern comes down to iron - a key component in blood - and a worry that vegetarian diets contain less of it. 
If your blood is low in iron, you won't be allowed to donate for your own safety. 
But as long as you follow a well-balanced diet you should get enough iron in your body. 
You can still give blood if you get a tattoo or a piercing, contrary to what 20% of people surveyed by NHSBT believed. 
There is a rule though: you have to wait four months from the date of your tattoo or piercing before donating. 
And if you give blood between four months to a year after having a tattoo or piercing, staff at the donation centre might have a few extra safety checks to do.
The average adult has around 10 pints of blood in their body.
Making a donation uses about one pint, and your body works quickly to replace all the fluids and cells that have been lost. The blood you've donated is usually replenished within 24 hours. 
Your body is incredible - it can make around 2m new red blood cells every second, according to NHSBT.
You should be completely recovered from any infection for at least 14 days before giving blood - and if you've been on antibiotics you'll have to wait seven days after finishing your medication before donating. 
If you're on specific medical treatment, check with your local blood donation centre to see if you're eligible to give blood. 
You can give blood without a waiting period unless...
You're a man who's had sex with another man in the last three months.
You've had sex with a partner who's injected any type of drugs within the last three months.
You're a sex worker - although you may be accepted if you've not received money or drugs for sex in the past three months.

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48581317,"A ground-breaking study in Bangladesh has found that using data from mobile phone networks to track the movement of people across the country can help predict where outbreaks of diseases such as malaria are likely to occur, enabling health authorities to take preventative measures.  
Every year, malaria kills more than 400,000 people globally - most of them children.
Menpaw Mro lifted his young daughter on to his shoulders and began the long journey to the nearest hospital, in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, first on foot, then by boat and finally in a small motorised rickshaw.
Time was desperately short. 
For several days, he had assumed the fever afflicting six-year-old Rum Rao Mro was not serious and she would soon recover at home, in their village in this remote region of Bangladesh.
Instead, the fever steadily worsened, putting her life in danger.
""She could not sleep, she was crying all the time and had breathing difficulties,"" he says.
They never reached the hospital. Rum Rao died on the last leg of the journey. She'd been suffering from severe malaria.
Although in many areas of Bangladesh the number of people falling ill or dying from the malaria has dropped dramatically in recent years, it remains a persistent problem in the Chittagong Hill Tracts - with the region recording the highest number of cases in the country.
If these stubborn pockets of malaria were now to be tackled successfully, it would open up the tantalising possibility of Bangladesh finally being able to declare itself free of the deadly disease.
But doctors in the Hill Tracts believe they have only a short window of time to achieve this, because the parasites carrying the disease are becoming increasingly drug resistant. Many anti-malarial medicines now have no impact.
This drug resistance originated in Cambodia and has now spread to Myanmar, which shares a border with the Chittagong Hill Tracts, as do parts of eastern India.
""It's concerning because the malaria figures in India and Myanmar are worse than ours,"" says Dr Kamrul Hasan, who works in one of the main hospitals in the Hills Tracts. ""Their rate of infection is much higher than ours… that's why there is the possibility of the disease spreading into our country.""
But now help is at hand from an unexpected source: the mobile phones of millions of Bangladeshis.
It is part of a project based in the Chittagong region that for several years has been anonymously tracking the movements of people in the area using the data from their mobiles.
The big data provides an accurate picture of where they've travelled to in the region and beyond, making it possible to predict where malaria outbreaks are likely to occur.
While malaria is caused by mosquitoes biting people and in so doing introducing malaria parasites into the bloodstream, the insects themselves have a very short range of travel.
It is humans travelling to different parts of the country who can spread the disease. If they are carrying malaria parasites, these can be passed in to the local populations through mosquito bites. 
Thousands of kilometres away in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, the phone company Telenor collates all the anonymous data and sends it to be analysed by academics at Harvard School of Public Health and a research unit in Thailand run by specialists from Oxford and Mahidol universities.
""This is the first time we are using the mobile data to address the mobile and migrant population within the country,"" says Dr Mohammed Akataruzzaman, of Bangladesh's National Malaria Elimination Programme.
""This kind of big data through the mobile phone recording and also patient surveys about the disease will obviously help with the elimination of malaria within the country."" 
The different types of data, including medical information provided by the Bangladesh ministry of health, are used to create risk maps indicating the likely locations of malaria outbreaks so the local health authorities can then be warned to take preventative action, including spraying insecticides and stockpiling bed nets and medicines to protect the population from the disease. 
""I believe it is extremely important to use accurate information about travel patterns in order to understand how these diseases spread,"" says Kenth Engo Monsen, Telenor's senior research scientist.
""And a mobile operator has that information, So if you are truly going to eliminate these threats, then you also have to a use this information. It's one piece of the puzzle.""
That is a view shared by Dr Caroline Buckee, of Harvard School of Public Health, who says that understanding where parasites move to and from in Bangladesh is a major step forward.
""This is going to be absolutely critical to achieve elimination [of malaria],"" she says.
And this innovative use of big data could be used to help tackle other diseases, according to Mr Monsen, who believes the Bangladesh project could change the way mobile data will be used in the future.",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-48259367,"Jen Wight lived in fear of mental illness after her elder sister, Jo, was sectioned when they were teenagers. But by the age of 36 she had a good job, was happily married and had just given birth to a healthy baby. It seemed that she had been worrying for no reason. 
People always said we were like two peas in a pod. We were so similar that people would come up to me in the street and say, ""Hey, Jo! How're you doing?""
There were three years between us, but we were really close. Even when we were teenagers, Jo always wanted to include me and would take me out with all her cool friends. 
We had a very secure, happy childhood growing up in Stamford Hill, north London. There was no history of mental illness in our family, so when Jo became ill at 18 it was quite a shock. 
The first time she went into hospital she was there for nine months. I would go and visit her in the psychiatric ward at Homerton Hospital, but a combination of the very strong medication she was on and the illness itself had completely taken her personality away. My beautiful, kind, loving, creative sister was gone.
I kept my head down and made sure not to upset Mum and Dad or cause them any more problems. They did as much as they could to support me and shield me from what was happening with Jo, but it was very, very hard. I missed her so much. I always had a box of tissues beside my bed because I'd cry at night, the tears falling sideways and filling up my ears. 
Somehow I came to the conclusion that because I had a schizophrenic sister I would end up the same - Jo and I were so similar that I was convinced that it must be in me, as it was in her.
So on 15 March 1993, three years to the day since Jo had been sectioned, I spent the whole day in bed crying at my student house in Brighton, waiting for it to happen to me. I was 18, as Jo had been, and I felt so sad. The funny thing is, I'm a rational person - I was doing a science degree - yet I was completely convinced I was going to go mad that day, just like Jo. 
But nothing happened, and, with the passing of time, my fear of going mad ebbed away.
By the time I was 29 I was living back in London. I'd had a number of boyfriends but no-one that I'd wanted to settle down with, so I told all my friends that I was ready to meet someone and my friend Harriet said, ""I know just the guy!""
Kai was so good-looking, so intelligent and so kind. We moved in together after a year.
Unlike me, he'd always wanted to have children and gradually I came round to the idea. I really, really wanted to be with him, and as more and more of our friends started to have kids I was surprised by the strong love I felt for them.
At the tail end of 2008 we'd quit our jobs in London and moved to Australia, and we were living in Sydney when our baby son arrived in January 2012.
In those first crazy weeks after my son was born I was mostly incredibly happy. I really had no experience whatsoever of looking after a baby, but before the birth I'd read this fantastic book, written by a midwife, which covered everything. There was a bit about postnatal depression which I remember reading and thinking, ""That's not going to happen to me - I've been through tough times and been really sad, but I've never got depressed."" 
But on my third night in hospital after I'd had my son I was so exhausted that I couldn't sleep and things began to feel like they were unravelling in my mind. My thoughts were racing, my heart was beating too fast and I began to panic that I was going mad. In the middle of the night, after hours feeling paranoid and crying, I eventually pressed the call button for help. 
The nurse who came said, ""This is all totally normal. Almost all women go through this after their baby is born. You're exhausted and your hormones are plummeting, you just need a good cry.""
Relief flooded through me. I cried and cried and cried for hours on end. It felt like my tears were washing away my very worst fear, the one that had dogged me for more than 20 years. I'd been as close to madness as I was going to get and I hadn't gone mad.

When we left hospital it felt like I had started my life anew with my lovely baby and my beautiful husband. We were living in a flat on the waterfront in Sydney and for a while everything seemed wonderful.
I felt light and free, and quite euphoric. It seemed as though the part of my brain that had been unconsciously taken up with worrying about going mad for all those years was now free and available for other things. 
I wrote lists and lists of everything I wanted to achieve, planned trips abroad, and spent hours surfing the net - though most people with a newborn baby wouldn't have time for such things.
Neither of us realised that anything was wrong. At some point, Kai did say to one of his friends that he was slightly worried because I was acting a bit crazy, but his friend just said, ""My wife was exactly the same, they all go a bit crazy when the baby comes."" 
As the weeks went by I was sleeping less and less, and as the highs got higher, lows also started appearing. I started having arguments with Kai that would go on and on until we were exhausted by them, I was feeling really irritable and anxious about going out, and really struggled with breastfeeding. I'd really wanted to breastfeed my son, but by week five I was expressing milk and bottle-feeding him it instead because the pain had become unbearable.
The 22nd anniversary of Jo's breakdown was approaching when the psychosis hit me. Kai and I had taken our son to the doctor for his six-week checks, and as I flicked through a magazine in the waiting room I became convinced that I was the actress Cameron Diaz and had secretly moved to Australia to have my baby.  
Soon afterwards, at a group for new mums, a nurse became alarmed by my behaviour. I was laughing uncontrollably and told her I was too excited to sleep, my words tumbling out over one another. At the end of the session, when Kai arrived to collect me and our son, the nurse urged him to ring the mental health crisis team straight away.
I was terrified that they would section me, but they asked how I was feeling and if I'd had any thoughts of harming my son or myself, and then prescribed me a sedative to help me sleep.
After they'd left they called Kai to tell him not to leave me on my own with my son, or on my own full stop. Some people would be really freaked out if somebody said that about their wife, but Kai never transmitted anything to me, he just carried on taking care of us. But when he did tell me, some time later, that they'd thought I might harm our son I was completely devastated.
I was having more and more strange thoughts, as well as periods of elation followed by crushing anxiety. They started talking about postpartum psychosis and put me on an antipsychotic drug - the same drug that Jo had taken when she first became ill. I felt frightened and hopeless, I was one step closer to being just as ill as her. 
The delusions came and went: I was going to find a cure for cerebral palsy; Barack Obama was coming to Australia to discuss how to catch paedophiles with me; I could control dogs with my mind. I was so wrapped up in what was happening in my head that I didn't really realise how much Kai was struggling. He was doing all the night feeds, the daytime feeds, nappy-changing and bearing all the responsibility for my son and me, with no family support.
He'd sit in our bedroom listening to me moving around the flat in the middle of the night, bone-tired but fearful of what I might do. Sometimes he'd find me in our son's room with the lights blazing, staring down at the baby or picking him up out of bed, after he'd spent hours trying to settle him.
Finally, I pushed Kai too far. In the middle of one of our arguments, I opened the front door of our apartment, stepped on to the landing outside - five storeys up - and flipped my leg over the handrail. Kai screamed at me and pulled me away from the edge. 
NHS: Postpartum psychosis
I don't remember that happening, Kai only told me when I was much better. He was horrified and furious, but it made him realise that I had to go into hospital.
In the car I was scared. I pictured padded cells and straitjackets, electrodes being attached to my head, electricity scrambling my brain. 
Thankfully Kai and my son were allowed to stay with me, but after a week I discharged myself. The delusions seemed to have passed and I just wanted to get home and try to get to grips with being a new mum again. But I'd only been out of hospital for a week when the depression came.
The doctor told us it's very common to experience depression after a period of mania and delusions, but that was the start of months of grinding misery. The pain was so bad on my really bad days that I considered suicide as a way out. Terrible thoughts went round and round in my head.
""I can't cope with this pain, I have to do something, that's the only thing I can do, I can't do that, I can't cope with this pain..."" 
The only thing stopping me from acting on those thoughts was the hurt that I would cause Kai, my son and my family. But then I felt so guilty that as a parent I could even consider doing that to my child, that I felt even worse.
Progress was slow and painful, but gradually, once I was on an effective dose of antidepressants, I felt as though I was returning to normal. The best thing was when I realised I'd started to really enjoy being with my son, rather than being frightened of looking after him.
One of the silver linings of being ill with psychosis is that it's helped me understand Jo's experience. She's 46 now and she's crafted a life for herself - cooking, growing things in her garden and making cards for the local charity shops. She absolutely adores my son. She sends him little parcels and paints him pictures, but her illness is an enormous burden for her and life is very hard.
I tried my best when I had depression, but I wasn't the mother that I would've been otherwise - I didn't laugh, and though I tried to sing it was just too hard. I worried that my lack of love and care in those early days might somehow have damaged my son's development, but a child psychologist told us that she thought the bond between us was good and that perhaps the more significant thing that my illness had done was affect my confidence as a parent. 
I've put lots and lots of effort in and now my relationship with my son is so much better. We've both changed, him and I. He's seven and I get so much joy from being with him. When you've had the extreme pain of severe depression, felt suicidal and got through it, normal life and the little things just seem so wonderful. For me, being a mum is getting better and better with each passing year. 
Kai and I went through a horrendous experience together, but we survived it and that's made us stronger - we feel almost bombproof now. But I wouldn't have any more children, mainly because I want to minimise the risk of experiencing depression like that again. And we are just really, really happy - we love being a family of three.

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-48597421,"A man who is one of six brothers all infected by contaminated blood has told how four of his siblings died.
Giving evidence to the inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal, John Cornes said he was infected with Hepatitis C during treatment for haemophilia. 
He said his family had been ""ripped apart mentally"" and two of his children had changed their surname due to the stigma.
The inquiry is being held in Leeds until 21 June.
It is looking at how thousands of patients were given infected blood products during the 1970s and 1980s in what has repeatedly been called ""the worst treatment scandal in the history of the NHS"".
Some 4,800 people with haemophilia were infected with Hepatitis C over two decades. More than 2,000 are thought to have died.
Mr Cornes, 58, from Kings Heath, Birmingham, told the hearing three of his brothers were infected with HIV and died in the 1990s. 
Gary, 26, died in 1992, Roy, also 26, died in 1994 and Gordon, 40, in 1995.
Another brother, who was also infected with Hepatitis C, died two years ago.
Mr Cornes said Roy unwittingly ""infected a girl with HIV and she died before he died"". 
""The press got hold of it and came down on the family, they ripped the family apart mentally,"" he said.
Mr Cornes said they were known as ""the scumbags"" or ""the Aids family"" in Birmingham, with 50 reporters hiding in hedges at Gary's funeral to take photographs. 
Gary's wife also contracted HIV and died in 2000, he added.
He said: ""I have got a load of nephews and nieces from the brothers who have died and I have nephews that haven't got a mother or a father.
""So it's affected at least 30 of my family, so I am here to represent not just the infected, but also the affected.""
He compared the treatment of his family to what the Irish community went through in Birmingham in the aftermath of the 1974 pub bombings.
He said: ""If you were Irish you would be beaten up, there was a real bad atmosphere. 
""What happened to our family was exactly the same thing, the 'Aids family'. It wasn't their fault and it wasn't our fault, what happened to us.""
Mr Cornes, who started to receive treatment for haemophilia in the late 1970s, said that as children ""the only treatment was transfusions with ice cold packs to stop the bleeding"".
When asked if he was given any warnings about potential problems with the treatment, he replied: ""We weren't given none.. we didn't know anything about viruses or anything like that.""",,,,

The death is the first in Uganda, amid a deadly outbreak in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. Officials said his grandmother and younger brother also had the disease. 
The Ugandan government is now reporting seven suspected cases of Ebola.
The boy is said to have travelled across the border with his family from DR Congo on Sunday.
He was then taken to a Ugandan hospital after exhibiting symptoms, including vomiting blood, officials said.
The World Health Organization (WHO), citing Uganda's Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng, announced on Twitter that the boy had died on Tuesday.
More than 2,000 cases have been recorded in DR Congo in the last 10 months - most of which have been fatal. 
Fifty people in Uganda are suspected to have come into contact with the seven people known to have contracted the deadly disease, the Ugandan government said.
The government has suspended mass gatherings including market days and prayers. Market days in the town of Kasese attract an estimated 20,000 people at the border area.
Uganda's health ministry and the WHO said a rapid response team had been dispatched to identify others at risk and to follow up on eight other possible cases.
Uganda has already vaccinated about 4,700 health workers against the disease, according to a joint statement by WHO and Ugandan health officials.
The outbreak in DR Congo is the second biggest in history, with a significant spike in new cases noted in recent weeks. Nearly 1,400 people have died of the disease since August.
Only once before has an outbreak continued to grow more than eight months after it began - that was the epidemic in West Africa between 2013 and 2016, which killed 11,310 people.",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48595961,"Strobe lighting at music festivals can increase the risk of epileptic seizures, researchers have warned.
The Dutch team said even people who have not been diagnosed with epilepsy might be affected.
Their study was prompted by the case of a 20-year-old, with no history of epilepsy, who suddenly collapsed and had a fit at a festival.
The Epilepsy Society said festivals should limit lighting to the recommended levels.
Epilepsy is a condition that affects the brain. There are many types, and it can start at any age. 
Around 3% of people with epilepsy are photosensitive, which means their seizures are triggered by flashing or flickering lights, or patterns.
The Health and Safety Executive recommends strobe lighting should be kept to a maximum of four hertz (four flashes per second) in clubs and at public events.
The researchers studied electronic dance music festivals because they often use strobe lighting.
They looked at data on people who needed medical care among the 400,000 visitors to 28 day and night-time dance music festivals across the Netherlands in 2015. The figures included 241,000 people who were exposed to strobe lights at night-time festivals.
Thirty people at night-time events with strobe lighting had a seizure, compared with nine attending daytime events.
The team, led by Newel Salet of the VU Medical Centre in Amsterdam, writing in BMJ Open, said other factors could increase the risk of seizures.
But they added: ""Regardless of whether stroboscopic lights are solely responsible or whether sleep deprivation and/or substance abuse also play a role, the appropriate interpretation is that large [electronic dance music] festivals, especially during the night-time, probably cause at least a number of people per event to suffer epileptic seizures.""
They advise anyone with photosensitive epilepsy to either avoid such events or to take precautionary measures, such as getting enough sleep and not taking drugs, not standing close to the stage, and leaving quickly if they experience any ""aura"" effects.
Mr Salet told BBC News: ""If a person has no predisposition for epilepsy, then factors like strobe lighting will not have any effect. However, most people are unaware of this predisposition they might have: more than a couple of cases explicitly reported this to be the first time they experienced an epileptic fit."" 
Clare Pelham, chief executive at the Epilepsy Society, said: ""The festival season has become something of a rite of passage. We would encourage festival organisers to at least warn visitors that they are using strobe lighting so that festival-goers can decide whether it will be safe for them to attend before buying their tickets.
""But it would be really life-affirming, in these days when we aspire to inclusivity, if organisers could do the responsible thing and keep the strobe lighting at a rate that should not pose a risk.
""The festival season is all about having a good time, but that should include everyone together, in a safe and supportive environment.""",,,,

Nearly 1,400 people have died in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Dr Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, said the epidemic was the worst since that of 2013-16 and has showed ""no sign of stopping"". 
Two people have also died in neighbouring Uganda, the first cases of Ebola reported in the country.
A five-year-old boy infected with the virus died on Tuesday and his 50-year-old grandmother died on Wednesday, the Ugandan health ministry said.
The Ugandan government has reported at least six other suspected cases of the virus.
In a statement, Dr Farrar said the spread was ""tragic but unfortunately not surprising"". He warned that more cases were expected, and a ""full"" national and international response would be needed to protect lives.
""The DRC should not have to face this alone,"" he said.
Since the first case of Ebola in DR Congo last August, nearly 1,400 people have died - around 70% of all those infected. 
The outbreak is the second-largest in the history of the disease, with a significant spike in new cases in recent weeks.
Only once before has an outbreak continued to grow more than eight months after it began - that was the epidemic in West Africa between 2013-16, which killed 11,310 people.
Efforts to contain the spread have been hindered by militia group violence and by suspicion towards foreign medical assistance. 
Nearly 200 health facilities have been attacked in DR Congo this year, forcing health workers to suspend or delay vaccinations and treatments. In February, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) put its activities on hold in Butembo and Katwa - two eastern cities in the outbreak's epicentre.
In Uganda, a five-year-old boy died of the virus on Tuesday, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Officials said his grandmother and younger brother also had the disease. The boy is said to have travelled across the border with his family from DR Congo on Sunday. He was then taken to a Ugandan hospital after exhibiting symptoms, including vomiting blood, officials said.
Seven other cases have been confirmed in the country, and Uganda's government said 50 people were suspected to have come into contact with those infected.
Analysis by James Gallagher, Health and Science Correspondent, BBC News
Cases of Ebola appearing in another country are always a significant and worrying development. The key question now is how far has the virus spread in Uganda?
Has it been contained to just the family that crossed the border from DR Congo or has it spread more widely? This is a moment that Uganda has long prepared for and, hopefully, measures such as pre-emptively vaccinating healthcare workers will lower the risk of Ebola spreading.
This outbreak is already the second largest in human history and some have predicted it could take up to two more years to bring to an end. The WHO has twice ruled that this Ebola outbreak is not a yet global emergency. Its Emergency Committee will meet again on Friday.
In Uganda, mass gatherings including market days and prayers have been cancelled. Market days in the town of Kasese attract an estimated 20,000 people at the border area.
Uganda's health ministry and the WHO said a rapid response team had been dispatched to identify others at risk.

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48612363,"Ashleigh White's son Noah became seriously ill with neonatal herpes after being infected with HSV-1, the highly contagious ""herpes simplex virus"" that causes cold sores in adults. It is sometimes known as the ""kiss of death"" because of the way it is passed on.
HSV-1 in babies is rare and can be prevented, but if kissed by a person who has a cold sore, a young baby can become seriously ill with the virus, as their immune system has not fully developed to fight it off.
Noah was just four weeks old when Ashleigh, who's from Barnsley, noticed he was starting to display the symptoms of neonatal herpes.
""His eye started to get a bit swollen and crusty, and a few days later blisters appeared, so we took him to the doctors and we were referred straight to hospital,"" Ashleigh told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast.
At first the doctors did not diagnose Noah with neonatal herpes, but Ashleigh had seen a post on Facebook from someone raising awareness of HSV-1, and persisted in telling the doctors that Noah had the virus.
""He did become very ill,"" she said. ""I did manage to catch it in time before it did go systemic and start shutting down all his vital organs. It was around his eye and there were fears of him going blind."" 
Neonatal herpes is a rare condition, and according to the World Health Organisation, it occurs in an estimated 10 out of every 100,000 births globally, but can lead to lasting neurologic disability or death. The virus is common among adults.
Dr Liz Bragg, a paediatrician at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, told 5 Live Breakfast: ""Once you've got [the virus] you've got it forever. Between 50 and 90% of people in the world have had it and have got it living inside them. It's not infectious unless you've got an outbreak.""
She also had advice for parents of newborn babies on how to avoid infection: ""In the first month of life, you really do not want to be going to crowded places - you don't want to be handing the baby around because their immune system is less good at fighting off infection.""  
Once he was diagnosed, Noah was sent to Sheffield Children's Hospital and was given regular antiviral drugs for two weeks. He was then put on preventative antiviral drugs for another six months.
""All in all, the total time he spent in hospital was around two and half months,"" said Ashleigh.
Ashleigh posted Noah's story on Facebook and it was shared more than 10,000 times.
""I've had a lot of messages from other parents thanking me for trying to raise awareness of how dangerous it actually is.""

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48613789,"Shops offering tattoos and piercings pose an infection risk, and laws on who works in them should be tightened, say public health experts.
At present, anyone in the UK can set up a parlour and offer procedures without proper training, a report from the Royal Society for Public Health says.
But with one in five adults now having a tattoo, more should be done, it says, to protect the public.
NHS England said higher standards were ""long overdue"".
""It shouldn't be left to pick up the pieces from dodgy tattoo parlours who don't take infection control seriously,"" its medical director Prof Stephen Powis said.
The Royal Society's report looks at so-called special procedures - tattooing, cosmetic piercing, acupuncture and electrolysis - which have all grown in popularity in recent years.
The procedures involve piercing the skin and, without good care by the technician and customer, bacteria and other organisms can get into the body, risking infection.
The report describes how a teenager with an infection in an ear-piercing ended up being put on a drip and having the top of her ear removed.
Infections can come from microorganisms living on the skin or those introduced to the body through dirty needles, the report says. These can include hepatitis, tuberculosis, syphilis and HIV.
Outbreaks of infection have been linked to tattooing and piercing in the UK and all four special procedures have caused allergic reactions, it adds.
While most people don't experience any negative effects, a survey of nearly 900 people found a small number did (18%) - with the most common issues being burning or swelling afterwards.
Two per cent said they contracted a skin infection while one in 10 of those with side effects said they needed medical treatment.
In the same survey, 98% of people said training in infection control should be a legal requirement for anyone carrying out the procedures.
But this does not currently exist anywhere in the UK. 
Different parts of the country have different laws and regulations in place.
Wales is the only part of the UK where a compulsory licensing scheme for tattoo parlours and others offering similar services is being planned.
This means technicians who offer the procedures will need to have an approved infection control qualification, and this information will be put into a national database.
This stops technicians moving counties and setting up new businesses if they have a poor history of infection. 
Scotland also has a licensing scheme for business owners but there is no requirement for technicians to have a qualification.
In most areas of England and Northern Ireland, business only have to fill in a registration form to open up a shop. The report says these systems are ""outdated and do not provide any reassurance to the public that the business they are visiting is safe"".
The Department of Health and Social Care in England said local authorities had the power ""to regulate the hygiene and cleanliness of tattoo and piercing providers if they judge there is a risk to health and safety"". 
A spokesperson said: ""We are committed to improving the safety of cosmetic procedures through better training for practitioners and providing clear information so people can make informed decisions."" 
Ministers recently launched a campaign to make sure people were fully aware of the risks of cosmetic procedures.
The Royal Society for Public Health's report calls for:
Shirley Cramer, chief executive of RSPH, said: ""We would call on the rest of the UK to follow the example set by Wales to ensure infection control and other health risks are minimised, by introducing a mandatory licensing scheme which will require practitioners in place to ensure that the risk of complications is reduced.""
Prof Powis said: ""Getting a tattoo or piercing might appear cool, but ending up with hepatitis or sepsis certainly isn't.
""All organisations involved need to take their responsibilities seriously, particularly when it comes to young people, and higher standards are long overdue."" 
NHS England has called for all providers of cosmetic procedures, such as fillers and injections, to be officially registered by the new Joint Council for Cosmetic Practitioners. 
Plastic surgeons support the call for non-surgical cosmetic procedures to be restricted to over-18s, unless there is a medical need.
But the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons said they didn't go far enough.
""The risks associated with cosmetic fillers are far-reaching and, if not administered correctly, the complications can be severe and even life-changing. 
""Practitioners must be fully qualified to not only prevent infection, but ensure that only a regulated, high-quality filler product is administered to patients that have been made fully aware of the risks of their procedure.""",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48596605,"The infection of up to 30,000 people with contaminated blood has been called the biggest treatment disaster in NHS history. Thousands have died.
A public inquiry has been taking evidence about the scandal and is due to hear from Health Secretary Matt Hancock.
People with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders were given blood infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses, during the 1970s and 1980s.
It was the result of a new treatment intended to make their lives better. A clotting agent called Factor VIII was introduced to help their blood to clot.  
Before this, patients faced lengthy stays in hospital to have transfusions, even for minor injuries.  
People who had blood transfusions after an operation, or childbirth, are also thought to have been exposed.    
About 5,000 people are believed to have been infected - but some estimates put the number at 30,000. Nearly 3,000 people have died.  
The UK was struggling to keep up with demand for the Factor VIII blood clotting treatment, so supplies began to be imported from the US.    
But much of the human blood plasma used to make it came from donors such as prison inmates and drug-users, who sold their blood.
These groups were at higher risk of blood-borne viruses.
However, at the time, HIV had not been diagnosed and understanding about hepatitis was still developing.
The risk of contamination was raised further because Factor VIII was made by pooling plasma from up to 40,000 donors and concentrating it.   
By the mid-1980s, once it was clear HIV was blood-borne, the products started to be heat-treated, to kill the viruses. 
But questions remain about how much was known before this time.
Despite these precautions, some of the contaminated blood products remained in circulation and continued to be used.
Screening of all blood products began in 1991. 
And by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk.
The UK-wide inquiry was launched after years of campaigning by victims, who claim the risks were never explained and the scandal was covered up. It is being led by former judge Sir Brian Langstaff.
One of the first to take the stand in 2019 was Derek Martindale, who has haemophilia. He was 23 when he was diagnosed with HIV and given a year to live, in 1985. He survived but his brother - who was also infected with HIV - did not.   
The inquiry has also heard from victims' relatives including Liz Hooper, who lost two husbands, both of whom had been given infected blood.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give evidence.
""This is the first time a serving [UK] cabinet minister will have given evidence in front of victims and their families,"" said Su Gorman, whose husband Steve Dymond died aged 62 in December 2018 of organ failure linked to hepatitis C.
Ministers from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already given evidence.
Financial compensation for the families of victims has been an ongoing question, with UK nations offering different levels.
In March, Cabinet Office minister Penny Mordaunt announced compensation for victims' families in England would be increased, to bring it in line with other parts of the UK.
There have been thousands of cases of people being given infected blood in the US. 
But other countries also imported blood products during the 1970s and 1980s. 
In Europe, cases in France, Ireland, Portugal and Italy have been identified. Japan, Canada, Iran and Iraq have also been caught up in the scandal.
In the US, companies that supplied infected products have paid out millions of dollars in out-of-court settlements.
In other countries, politicians and drug companies have been convicted of negligence. 
None of that has happened in the UK - although victims have been given limited financial support.
At the opening of the inquiry, it was announced that criminal trials could follow.",,,,

Three suspected Ebola patients have also run away from an isolation centre in south-western Uganda.

On Friday the World Health Organization (WHO) will decide whether the outbreak should now be deemed a global health emergency.
The grandmother had lived in DR Congo, where her husband recently died of Ebola. Her daughter had travelled from Uganda, where she lives with her Ugandan husband, to the Congolese town of Beni with her children to help care for him.
After the grandfather died they all travelled on Sunday to Uganda's Kasese district, where the five-year-old son and his grandmother then subsequently became sick and later died.
The three-year-old son is now confirmed to have Ebola. He, his parents and two of his siblings have been repatriated at their request to DR Congo, Uganda's health ministry says.
Twenty-seven people are said to have been in contact with the three confirmed cases in Uganda. They have been restricted to their homes and will be vaccinated against Ebola.
The people who fled from a hospital isolation unit had been found to have high temperatures when they crossed the border from DR Congo to the Ugandan district of Kanungu, which is about 150km (93 miles) south of Kasese. Medical workers did not get a chance to take samples of their blood to send for testing before their escape.

This isn't the first time the virus has struck the country. Outbreaks in 2012, 2007 and 2000 have prompted the health ministry to build capacity, says Director of Clinical Services Dr Charles Olaro.
Public health information campaigns broadcast to at-risk areas have been key in preventing the spread since the first case of Ebola was reported over the border in DR Congo last August. Mass gatherings, including market days and prayers, have been cancelled. Market days in the town of Kasese attract an estimated 20,000 people at the border area.
Uganda's health ministry and the WHO said a rapid response team had been dispatched to identify others at risk. The country has already vaccinated about 4,700 health workers against the disease, according to a joint statement by WHO and Ugandan health officials. Ebola screening centres are in operation along the border with DR Congo as well as other major entry and exit points.
Authorities have identified 22 high-risk districts - places that are close to the border and have high levels of movement - and deployed medical monitors to spot and manage any cases they find.
A database of experts is on hand to deal with different scenarios, the health ministry says, and Uganda also benefits from the expertise of health workers it deployed to contain previous outbreaks in West Africa.
Nearly 1,400 people have died over the last 10 months - around 70% of all those infected. 
The outbreak is the second-largest in the history of the disease, with a significant spike in new cases in recent weeks.
Only once before has an outbreak continued to grow more than eight months after it began - that was the epidemic in West Africa between 2013-16, which killed 11,310 people.

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48637688,"The World Health Organization has decided not to declare a global emergency over the Ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The WHO said Ebola was ""very much an emergency"" in the region, but it did not pose a global threat.
However, it was damning of countries for giving less than half the money needed to deal with the disease.
The deadly outbreak - the second largest in history - has killed more than 1,400 people. 
This week cases were detected across the border in Uganda, though the virus is not yet spreading there.
Declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern is one of the most important acts the WHO can take. 
It has done so only four times before - including for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa which killed more than 11,000 people. 
Such a decision usually means getting more money and healthcare workers to tackle an outbreak - or political support to stop the fighting to let medics get the job done. 
This was not a straightforward decision.
Dr Preben Aavitsland, the acting chair of the WHO's emergency committee, said there was extensive debate and differing views at the emergency meeting. 
The outbreak met some of the criteria for a global emergency as it was both an extraordinary event and risked international spread.
However, he said efforts on the ground ""would not be enhanced"" by declaring an emergency. 
Dr Aavitsland said: ""This is not a global emergency, it is an emergency in DRC, it is a severe emergency.""
But he warned declaring an emergency could lead to border closures or airlines refusing to fly to DRC, which could do more harm than good.
""There is nothing to gain, but there is a lot to lose,"" he said.
The WHO has previously discussed whether the Ebola outbreak in DRC should be declared an emergency on two occasions. 
Both times it decided not to, in part because Ebola was deemed a threat in only in the region rather than internationally. 
The outbreak started in August 2018 and is affecting two provinces in DRC - North Kivu and Ituri.
More than 2,100 people have been infected and over 1,400 have died. 
It took 224 days for the number of cases to reach 1,000, but just a further 71 days to reach 2,000.
There are some positive signs with the number of new cases slowing - there were 54 cases in the past week compared with 88 in each of the two previous weeks. 
However, 54 cases is still more than the totality of many Ebola outbreaks. 
Tackling the disease has been complicated by conflict in the region - between January and May there were more than 40 attacks on health facilities. 
Another problem is distrust of healthcare workers with about a third of deaths being in the community rather than at a specialist Ebola treatment centre. 
It means those people are not seeking treatment and risk spreading the disease to neighbours and relatives.
Two people have died from Ebola in neighbouring Uganda - a five-year-old boy and his 50-year-old grandmother. 
They were members of a family that crossed the border from DRC.
While the WHO says such cases are of ""grave concern"" is says there is no evidence of the virus spreading in Uganda. 
Twenty-seven people are said to have been in contact with the infected family. They have all been restricted to their homes and will be offered the Ebola vaccine.
The WHO is clear that more needs to be done. 
It said that between February and July it needed $98m to tackle the outbreak, but it was facing a shortfall of $54m.
Sir Jeremy Farrar, from the Wellcome medical research charity, said: ""A step up in the response with full international support is critical if we're to bring the epidemic to an end and ensure protection for the communities at risk. 
""The response in DRC remains overstretched and underfunded.""",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48254137,"Medicine has always been personal to some extent - a doctor looks for the best way to help the patient sitting in front of them. 
But with advances in technology, it is becoming possible to use the most unique of characteristics - our genomes - to tailor treatments for individuals.
Genomes are made up of a complete set of our DNA, including all of our genes, and are the instruction manual on how to build and maintain the 37 trillion cells in our bodies. 
Any two people share more than 99% of their DNA. It's the remaining less than 1% that makes us unique, and can affect the severity of a disease and effectiveness of treatments.
Looking at these small differences can also help us understand the best way to treat a patient for a range of diseases - from cancer and heart disease to depression.
Cancer is the most advanced area of medicine in terms of developing personalised treatments.  
In the UK, differences in the DNA sequence are being used by the NHS to help doctors prevent and predict cancer.  
For example, women with an increased risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer have been identified by screening for changes to the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. 
Mutations in these genes increase a woman's risk of breast cancer by four-to-eightfold and can explain why some families see many relatives with the disease. A BRCA1 mutation gives women a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of 40-50%.
Screening has helped women make informed choices about treatment and prevention - for example, whether to have a mastectomy.
It is steps like these - splitting patients into ever smaller groups to identify the best treatments - that is taking us towards personalisation.
For certain cancers, measuring gene activity is becoming commonplace. 
Gene activity is a little like the dimmer switch on a light - it can be set to low, high or anywhere in between. Measuring this allows us to see how active a particular gene is in a tissue or cell. 
In breast cancer, a test measuring the activity of 50 genes in tumours can be used to guide decisions about whether the patient will benefit from chemotherapy. 
To extend this approach to other cancers, researchers are switching off all of the genes in hundreds of tumours grown in the laboratory. In doing so, scientists are looking for cancer's weaknesses - to try to produce a detailed rule book for precision treatment. 
The development of such techniques raises the question: how far can personalisation go?
For illnesses like heart disease, diabetes and infectious diseases, a combination of genetic, lifestyle and life events also play a part.
This means that information about small differences in the DNA sequence alone will not be enough to predict susceptibility and outcome.
Measuring the activity of our genes also captures information about current stresses to the body. For example, certain genes will have a higher or lower activity depending on the type of infection. 
Looking at gene activity could also provide important clues as to how to best treat a patient.
One life-threatening illness where these techniques could help is sepsis.
It is a condition in which the immune system damages its own organs when trying to fight an infection.
Anyone can develop sepsis and it kills 52,000 people each year in the UK - more than breast, bowel and prostate cancer combined. Worldwide, a third of patients who develop sepsis die. 
To save lives, general antibiotics are given first to reduce the infection. A blood test is done to find out which particular bacteria have caused the sepsis, so a more targeted antibiotic can be given. 
More like this
But these blood tests take precious time and cannot always identify the bacterium causing the infection. 
In our research, we are looking at gene activity in sepsis patients' immune systems, to give us clues as to why different people respond in different ways. 
We hope to pinpoint which part of their immune systems are not working properly - helping doctors decide how other drugs could be used.
This demonstrates how personalised medicine could be used for short-term treatment in intensive care, as well as for longer-term illnesses like cancer.
One challenge personalisation faces is speed - measuring what is happening in our genes is currently a slow, laboratory-based process. 
In order to be most effective in a medical setting, we need to be able to measure gene activity in a patient's blood instantly. 
New technology like the microelectrode biosensor device - which flags real-time critical changes in the blood - is being developed to make rapid analysis a reality. 
Through such advances it is hoped that genomic information, including gene activity, could become part of a GP's toolkit.
Given recent advances in research and technology, the information in our genomes is likely to be used more and more often and in settings beyond cancer.
Researchers are looking at the genetic links to depression and anxiety, to help them understand the causes and develop new personalised treatments.
They are also accessing large datasets like the UK Biobank to use the small differences in DNA sequence to identify people at high risk of a heart attack later in life.
It is unlikely that information from your genome will result in a ""personalised pill"" being manufactured just for you.  Rather it could help doctors to tailor the right combination of medicines to treat the right person at the right time.

The weight gain is particularly marked in children whose parents divorce before they are six, the study found. 
Researchers from the London School of Economics and Political Science analysed data on 7,574 children born between 2000 and 2002. 
The authors say their findings back calls for better health support for families going through a break-up. 
The paper suggests a range of reasons why children might put on weight after a divorce, both economic and non-economic. 
They include: 
 The information on the children was collected by the UK Millennium Cohort Study, which followed the lives of a representative UK-wide sample of children born at the start of the new millennium. 
The children were surveyed at the ages of nine months, three years, five, seven, 11 and 14, although this particular study excluded the data collected at 14, as the researchers wanted to focus on the period before adolescence. 
Of the children studied, 1,573 - or about one in five of the total - had seen their parents separate by the time they were 11. 
The study also looked at the children's heights and weights, ages and genders to calculate their body mass index (BMI) - a widely used measure of whether individuals are a healthy weight, overweight or obese. 
The results showed that children of separated parents gained more weight during the 24 months after their parents separated, than children whose parents stayed together over the same period. 
And children of separated parents were more likely to become overweight or obese within 36 months of the separation, the study found. 
The paper says the results underscore the idea that parental separation is ""a process with potentially long-lasting consequences"". 
The authors suggest that, as the study stopped when the children were 11, the data might underestimate the full extent of the children's weight gain over time ""because the magnitude of this association becomes stronger as the time since separation increases"". 
The authors argue that efforts to prevent children at risk from gaining weight should start soon after separation. 
""Intervening early could help to prevent, or at least attenuate, the process that leads some children to develop unhealthy obesity,"" they write. 
The study focused on the consequences of the first separation of children's biological parents, so children whose parents were later reconciled were not included in the analysis.

About 200 people a year in Scotland are recorded with the disease but the true number is thought to be much higher.
The disease is a bacterial infection spread by a bite from an infected tick.
Scotland's chief medical officer has written to all of the country's NHS boards and GPs urging them to be vigilant about Lyme disease.
Catherine Calderwood's advice comes amid an increase in the number of cases of the debilitating condition
She said doctors should be alert to the risks if the patient has a history of walking in the outdoors in areas where there are ticks.
Ms Calderwood said it was hard for GPs because a patient's symptoms could be vague - tiredness, muscle ache, maybe a runny nose - and the likelihood of it being Lyme disease was quite small. 
There is a distinctive rash which is shaped like a bullseye but not everyone gets one and this can make diagnosis tricky.
Health guidelines say for most people a course of antibiotics is an effective treatment but many claim they have a chronic form of the disease that persists with severe symptoms.
Such a condition is not widely accepted by doctors. 
Morven-May, from the Black Isle, is now 26 but she was just 14 when she suddenly fell ill.
""I was hugely into mountain biking, horse riding, I'd go up Munros at the weekend,"" she told the BBC Disclosure programme Under The Skin. 
""I was in training for climbing up the Mountain Morven up in Caithness. I was one of these really annoying people who never, ever stopped. I just kept going. I just bounced everywhere.""  
All that changed when what started off feeling like the flu became more serious.
She said: ""I'd fall asleep in the school bus and I would come home and I would just collapse in a heap on the couch. I literally got up, went to school and collapsed in utter exhaustion each day. 
""It got to the point where I had to leave school at 16 because by the time I got home from school each day I was so weak I couldn't physically walk."" 
Her doctors believed she was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome but then a neighbour - who had experienced Lyme disease - intervened.
Morven-May said: ""They'd seen me struggling to walk, and they said to my mother 'have you considered Lyme disease?'.
""She really researched it and she presented that research to the doctors and to specialists that I saw, and they refused again to accept that it could be Lyme disease because all my blood tests kept coming back as being negative."" 
It was eventually confirmed by a Lyme disease expert at a private clinic in England.
Morven-May said: ""She clinically diagnosed me after investigating my history and then she ordered blood tests which went to America and to Germany, and they came back positive with Lyme disease.""
It is now nine years since she started treatment but she said her life was still ""completely dominated"" by the disease. 
""There's not a single second in which I feel like it's not in control of me, and that it's not monopolising my body,"" she said.

Lyme was only recorded for the first time in the 1970s, by doctors in the USA. 
Reported cases are on the rise in the UK and and the Highlands have been identified as a hot spot for infections.
Dr James Douglas, a GP in Lochaber, regularly sees patients with the disease. 
He told BBC Scotland's Disclosure that the tick bite would be the first obvious sign but if the bacteria went deeper into the body it could cause quite significant illness. 
""It can affect primarily the nervous system, so it can start causing paralysis,"" he said. 
""It can affect the joints and when it gets to this stage antibiotics certainly can get rid of the bacteria but in a percentage of people they're left with some really quite debilitating symptoms for quite some considerable time.""
Dr Lucy Gilbert, from the University of Glasgow, is a leading expert on ticks and Lyme disease.
She said that when she was bitten her doctor refused to accept it could be Lyme disease.
Dr Gilbert said: ""It was really frustrating, because I knew I had it. I'd found a tick on me, I knew it was the right type of tick, it had been on for at least 24 hours, it was from an area where I knew other people had got Lyme disease previously. I'd got the bullseye rash, which is supposed to be diagnostic.""
Later, another doctor did prescribe intravenous antibiotics and she made a full recovery.
Most doctors say that definitive evidence of chronic or long-term Lyme disease has not been established.
Dr Douglas said there were ""scientific uncertainties"" in understanding how different people's immune systems responded to the bacterium. 
He said: ""I think what's happening is the bacteria is no longer there but I think their immune system is still very active and that's where they're getting these symptoms from because of the activity of the immune system, and almost the body kind of fighting itself.""

""It galls me every time I hear an advert on the radio asking for people to give blood, when there's a huge section of society that is just denied that for no good reason,"" says David - not his real name.
He is a sexually active gay man who donates blood to the NHS several times a year. 
""I grew up in a family who gave blood regularly and instilled in me that that was the right thing to do,"" he tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
""I did it before I started having sex with men - and I carried on doing it afterwards because, for me, that was the right thing to do.""
In 2017, rules were relaxed in England, Scotland and Wales to allow men who have sex with men to give blood after abstaining from sexual activity for three months. 
Previously, they had to wait a year - which remains the case in Northern Ireland.
NHS Blood and Transplant - the organisation that looks after blood in England - says the timeframe exists because, while all donations are screened, ""there is a period of time following contact with any infection when it would not be detected by our screening tests"".
The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs  (SaBTO) - which advises UK health departments - recommended the changes after concluding new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules.
It followed campaigning from LGBT organisations. But for some, it is still not enough.
David says the law remains ""rooted in deep homophobia"".
""I don't see why I should be denied the rights to help fellow people,"" he says.
""Certainly I don't think the people whose lives I've potentially saved would complain.""
Asked why he takes the risk, knowing medical professionals believe it unsafe, he says he practises safe sex and is tested more frequently than heterosexual people. 
""No straight person I know goes and gets checked every six months,"" he says.
David, like other men the programme spoke to that knowingly breach the rules, says he takes the Prep drug every day - which can prevent users from contracting HIV.
However, SaBTO's guidelines says those who have used PrEP within the previous three months cannot be accepted because of concerns about how it might impact on HIV screening results.
Su Brailsford, a consultant in health protection at NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), says it is ""very concerned"" by the programme's findings.
Donating before three months is not illegal and while the NHSBT does have strategies in place to protect blood supply, it cannot currently stop people such as David donating if they lie during donor health checks.
Ms Brailsford says: ""The safety of the seriously ill people who receive blood is our number one priority. 
""Blood donation exists for patients, not for blood donors.
""Anyone can acquire a blood-borne infection or a sexually transmitted disease but some people have an increased risk of exposure.
""At a population level, men who have sex with men have a higher risk.
""Using protection like a condoms or Prep can reduce this risk but may not eliminate it. 
""We have to consider not only the donor but also the potential risks of their partner.""
""All donors have to complete the donor health check when they come to donate - so it's not just men who have sex with men who we ask about what sort of sex they've been having.""

The safety of the UK's blood supply has recently been in the spotlight.
Families have been giving evidence in an inquiry examining why thousands of people in the 1970s and 80s were given infected blood products from high-risk sources - with many contracting hepatitis B or C or HIV.
But times have changed and blood screening has improved, leading many to suggest the three-month wait to donate should be reduced further.
The campaign group Freedom to Donate campaigns on this issue.
But for the charity's Ethan Spibey, ""it's not helpful"" for individuals to break the rules.
Ryan - not his real name - has been donating blood, against the rules, for nearly 10 years. 
He says the rules makes him feel he is not good enough and his blood does not matter.
""It's not nice that you're almost discriminated against and you know that you are doing something that you shouldn't be doing,"" he says.
""But at the same time, morally, you are helping somebody else by giving blood.""
Ryan gives blood after promising his mother he would continue to medically donate whatever he could, shortly before she suddenly died.  
He says he would not consider abstaining from sex in order to give blood and he takes precautions over his sexual health.
Asked whether he was worried other people giving blood would not be as careful, he said there would always be a risk - including with heterosexuals.
""How many heterosexual people have sex without contraceptive devices or condoms or anything? How much risk are they taking?"" he asks.
""I don't think that who I choose to have sexual relations with, or fall in love with, should have any bearing on giving blood.""

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-48667771,"A mother has laid bare the ""brutal reality"" of bringing up her adoptive son after he was left damaged by exposure to alcohol in the womb.
Judith Knox says her 12-year-old son has a range of behavioural problems as a result of Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD).
It is estimated that as many as 172,000 people could be affected by the disorder in Scotland.
But Ms Knox said it took six years for her son to be properly diagnosed. 
FASD is an umbrella term that describes the adverse physical and emotional conditions that affect people whose mother drank during pregnancy.
A new support service for parents and carers, called FASD Hub Scotland, has now been launched.
Ms Knox, who does not want to name her son or identify him through recent pictures, said the service was long overdue.
She told BBC Scotland: ""This has put a lot of strain on the family.
""Your parenting is always being scrutinised and he just wants 100% of your attention, 100% of the time.""
The 51-year-old and her ex-husband adopted their son at the age of seven months and he quickly began to exhibit a raft of worrying behaviour.
This included biting his fingers until they bled in a bid to stave off sleep, picking plaster from the walls to eat and ignoring the range of toys his family had bought him. 
Her son was eventually diagnosed with FASD at the age of six, after doctors initially wrongly thought he had Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. But his behaviour continued to push his family to their limits. 
""It was difficult then and it is still difficult,"" said Ms Knox, who is based in Fife.
""Sometimes you go around covering up bruises, that is the brutal reality. 
""He has huge problems with social interaction, he is very intense and a lot of children find that difficult. 
""He can also get involved in risky behaviours because of his disability, because of a lack of impulse control and it can lead down a road of vulnerability.""
She added: ""People have stopped and taken videos of my son taking a meltdown and us trying to protect ourselves.
""If we go out for the day we have to have a plan B, C, D and E.""
The NHS recommends the safest approach for pregnant women is not to drink alcohol at all to keep risks to their babies to a minimum.
The risks occur when alcohol passes across the placenta from the mother to the developing foetus.
The foetus cannot process alcohol effectively until the liver is fully developed and high levels of alcohol can affect the development of organs and the brain.
It is thought foetuses are most at risk during the first three months of pregnancy when organs are forming - but damage can occur at any time.
Those affected by FASD can have a range of issues, such as differences in their facial features as well as learning and behavioural difficulties.
It is estimated approximately 3.2% of babies born in the UK are affected by FASD, which is nearly four times the rate of autism, but it often goes undiagnosed or is misunderstood by doctors and the public alike. 
Children looked after or adopted are at significantly increased risk of having FASD, with 75% of children referred for adoption having a history of alcohol exposure during pregnancy, according to Scottish government figures. 
Ms Knox said that, despite the severe challenges with her son's behaviour, he remained very caring and described him as ""charming and very funny"".
She added the teenager, who is a resident at a specialist support school, plays the drums and guitar, which is when he is at his happiest.
Looking to the future, she said her aspirations for him were simple. 
""I hope he can tell the time, deal with money and keep himself safe and not end up in a bad situation,"" she said.
The FASD Hub Scotland will provide direct support services for people affected by, or living with, FASD.
Ms Knox, who will work on the new service being launched by Adoption UK Scotland, said it would be a boon for people in her situation.
""I was given no information about the condition or where I could go for help and advice,"" she said. ""At that time, I knew of no other parent or carer in the same position and I felt very alone and isolated.""
Project Lead Aliy Brown added: ""We cannot cure FASD, but many people can live very successfully with it, if provided with the right support at the right time."" 
The support service has been given £140,000 by the Scottish government.
Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick said: ""A diagnosis of FASD is difficult for families and we can't underestimate the challenges each diagnosis brings.   
""It is vital that we recognise the needs of this group of children and young people and ensure that the right support is available to them and their families when they most need it.""",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-48674909,"African countries with small to medium-sized economies pay far more money for less effective drugs, a leading health expert has told BBC Newsday.
In countries such as Zambia, Senegal and Tunisia, everyday drugs like paracetamol can cost up to 30 times more than in the UK and USA. 
Drug markets in poorer countries ""just don't work"", said Kalipso Chalkidou from the Centre for Global Development. 
She said ""competition is broken"" due to a ""concentrated supply chain"". 
Ms Chalkidou, director of global health policy at the organisation, co-authored a report on drug procurement that concluded that small to middling economy countries buy a smaller range of medicines, leading to weaker competition, regulation and quality. 
It says richer countries, thanks to public money and strong processes for buying drugs, are able to procure cheaper medicines.
Poorer countries, however, tend to buy the most expensive medicines, rather than cheaper unbranded pharmaceuticals which make up 85% of the market in the UK and US. 
The very poorest countries are not affected when foreign donors purchase medicine on their behalf, meaning their over-the-counter medicines remain at low cost.
""In the middle it's very problematic,"" Ms Chalkidou said. 
Low- to middle-income countries ""have little ability to negotiate prices down and quality assure products"" and there are lots of mark-ups, often due to taxes and corruption. 
She said less stringent regulation meant the quality of the drugs was also not as high. 
""Without regulation, people perceive the products don't work, so pay extra money for things they think will work and won't work either,"" Ms Chalkidou explained.  
The report recommends greater global co-operation and reforming World Health Organisation policy as well as policy in targeted countries to improve procurement practices.",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-48186856,"Vaccines have saved tens of millions of lives in the past century, yet in many countries health experts have identified a trend towards “vaccine hesitancy” – an increasing refusal to use vaccination.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is so concerned that it has listed this trend as one of the 10 threats to global health in 2019.
Before vaccines existed, the world was a far more dangerous place, with millions dying each year to now preventable illnesses.
The Chinese were the first to discover an early form of vaccination in the 10th Century.
Eight centuries later, British doctor Edward Jenner noticed how milkmaids caught mild cowpox, but rarely went on to contract the deadly smallpox.
In 1796 Jenner carried out an experiment on eight-year-old James Phipps.
The doctor inserted pus from a cowpox wound into the boy, who soon developed symptoms.
Once Phipps had recovered, Jenner inserted smallpox into the boy but he remained healthy. The cowpox had made him immune.
In 1798, the results were published and the word vaccine - from the Latin 'vacca' for cow - was coined.
Vaccines have helped drastically reduce the damage done by many diseases in the past century.
About 2.6m people were dying from measles every year before the first vaccination for the disease was introduced in the 1960s. Vaccination resulted in an 80% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2017 worldwide, according to the WHO.
Only a few decades ago, paralysis or death was a very real concern as millions fell victim to polio.  Now polio has almost disappeared. 
Suspicion of vaccines has been around almost as long as modern vaccines themselves.
In the past people were sceptical for religious reasons, because they thought vaccination was unclean, or because they felt it infringed on their freedom of choice.
In the 1800s so-called anti-vaccination leagues popped up across Britain, pushing for alternative measures to fight disease, such as isolating patients. 

In the 1870s, the first anti-vaccination group in the US started after a visit by a British anti-vaccination activist, William Tebb.
One of the key figures in the recent history of the anti-vaccination movement is Andrew Wakefield.
In 1998, the London-based doctor published a report falsely linking autism and bowel disease to the MMR vaccine.
Even though his paper was discredited and Wakefield was struck from the medical register in the UK, there was a drop in the number of children vaccinated after his claims.
The issue of vaccines is being increasingly politicised too.
Italy’s interior minister Matteo Salvini has allied himself with anti-vaccination groups.
US President Donald Trump, without evidence, appeared to link vaccinations to autism, but has recently urged parents to get their children vaccinated.
The biggest global study of attitudes to immunisation, conducted by the Wellcome Trust in 2019, suggested that distrust of vaccines was highest in Europe, with France the most sceptical. 
When a high proportion of the population is vaccinated it helps prevent the spread of disease which in turn provides protection for those who have not developed immunity or who cannot be vaccinated. 
This is called herd immunity and when it breaks down there is a risk to the wider population.
Last year in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, USA, fliers were distributed wrongly claiming links between vaccines and autism.
That same community has been at the centre of one of the largest outbreaks of measles in the US in decades.
England’s most senior doctor warned last year that too many people were being fooled by misleading information about vaccines on social media, and US researchers found that Russian bots were being used to sow discord online by posting false information about vaccines.
The proportion of the world’s children who receive recommended vaccines has remained unchanged at 85% for the past few years, according to the World Health Organization.
The WHO says vaccines continue to prevent between two and three million deaths worldwide every year.
The biggest challenges to vaccination, and the lowest rates of immunisation, are in countries with a recent history of conflict and extremely poor healthcare systems, including Afghanistan, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
But the WHO has also identified complacency as a key issue in developed countries; put simply people have forgotten the harm a disease can do.",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48690733,"Speaking during a live BBC debate, Jeremy Hunt - one of the candidates to replace Theresa May as Conservative Party leader and prime minister - said: ""I think, having been responsible for health and social care, that some of the cuts in social care did go too far."" 
Social care is the day-to-day support given to people who need extra help because of old age or disability or other health condition. 
That can be help at home with things like washing and dressing, taking medication and getting around, or full-time accommodation in a care home.
In the UK, publicly funded social care is mainly paid for by local councils, not the NHS. 
In 2017-18, local authorities in England spent £21.3bn on social care, down from £22bn in 2010-11.  
This formed part of wider cuts to spending in the aftermath of the 2008 recession.  
Social care is a devolved matter so, as Health Secretary from 2012-2018, Mr Hunt was responsible only for England's care system. 
Unlike the NHS, in England social care is not universally free - it's means-tested. So while we're talking about state-funded services here, a lot of people have to pay for at least some of their care. 
Since 2010, the overall grants councils in England receive from central government have been cut by about half, and their overall spending power - once they've topped up their budgets from local taxes and charges for things like parking - by just under a third. 
Spending on adult social care fell by about 10% between 2010 and 2013. 
It has since has crept back up again, following the introduction of the social care precept - a council tax rise which is ring-fenced to be spent on care, bringing the overall cut since 2010 to 5%.  
There has also been more money going to councils' care budgets from the NHS as part of something called the Better Care Fund -  a shared budget between the health service and local authorities designed to decrease the number of elderly people staying in hospital unnecessarily due to a lack of care waiting for them at home. 
So spending on social care has fallen, but a lot less dramatically than overall council budgets. That's because it comes with lots of legal duties, so the extent to which care budgets can be cut is limited. 
As a result, councils have been spending a growing proportion of their budgets on social care for both adults and children.
Local authorities spent 34% of their budget for public services on adult social care in 2009-10. By 2017-18 the average share going on adult social care was 41%.
Last year about 40% of this budget was spent supporting working-age adults, and 60% on elderly care. 
While funding has been protected more than for some other services, this comes in the context of growing demand. 
We're living longer and more people are living with complex conditions which mean they need some level of support. So even with the same amount of money to spend, councils' budgets are being squeezed. And this demand is forecast to keep growing.  
Social care has proved difficult to reform in the past, with report after report leading to little substantive change.

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-47912563,"Lee Donald didn't think she would see her 21st birthday.
She had struggled with an eating disorder from the age of 13 and at her lowest point made herself sick more than 10 times a day.
But she successfully hid her problem throughout her teenage years because her weight was considered normal.
She explains: ""I maintained a normal weight for years and that's very common with bulimics in particular, to be able to maintain a normal weight.""
Now 37, Lee believes many eating disorders go unnoticed because they are so commonly associated with being a low weight.
""There's no definitive eating disorder weight,"" she says, adding that for her, the illness was ""not really about weight"".
Instead, it was ""much more about control and self harm"".
Binge eating and bulimia are the most common types of eating disorders in the UK with studies showing that 80-85% of people with eating disorders are not underweight.
Despite this, two in three adults are more likely to name being thin as a sign of an eating disorder, according to a survey by the charity Beat.
Rebecca Willgress, from Beat, says: ""It is important that we challenge stigma and stereotypes, educating that eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, not physical, can affect people of all ages, genders and backgrounds and that you cannot spot an eating disorder by simply looking at someone.
""The sooner someone gets treatment for an eating disorder, the better their chances of a rapid recovery, and it is essential that no one is denied care because they are deemed 'not thin enough'.""
For Lee, it wasn't until she had significantly dropped weight in the space of a year for friends to realise something was wrong. 
She was 19 at the time and working as a water sports instructor in France.
Lee recalls: ""I was thinking I was being sneaky being sick after meals, but actually my friends who were concerned about me followed me and they realised I was being sick.
""They told the centre manager and I got sent home. It was the worst thing that could possibly happen. 
""I wasn't deemed safe in case I passed out when I've got kids doing water sports.""
But Lee continued to be in denial about her bulimia despite the shock of losing her job.
She did not manage to get her eating disorder under control until she was 29.
When her health started to deteriorate, she realised she had to address her problem. She had always been a physically active person but she began to struggle to maintain this.
""My energy was very low. I found it very difficult to feel full - if I had food in my stomach and I felt full, I really, really struggled with it. I had to be sick.""
She describes beginning to feel faint regularly and not being able to think about anything other than being sick, which also led to her losing four front teeth.
""I was so sick of being sick.""
But getting better was a more difficult task than she thought it would be: ""I remember speaking to my sister, she was one of the first people to know, and she would ask 'how many days have you managed now?' and I'd count the days. 
""I'd say 'I've not been sick for five days', 'I've not been sick for six days', and then I'd be sick again.""
Lee sought help from counsellors, psychiatrists, a life coach, as well as being an outpatient and attending group meetings.
But it wasn't until she qualified as a personal trainer that she was able to get her life back on track.
Lee, who is married with two children, uses her experience to help others beat their eating disorders.
She says: ""If people are overweight, others seem to just think 'you're eating too much', whereas they actually could be really struggling with an eating disorder. In essence, regardless of whether somebody is overweight or obese, it is an eating disorder at the same time.
She adds: ""People who have issues with bingeing and being sick, it's totally normal for them to have a healthy weight. That doesn't mean to say they don't have an eating disorder and they're not having lots of problems.""

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48703955,"Working long hours is linked to an increased risk of stroke, researchers say.
Long hours were defined in the French study as more than 10 hours on at least 50 days per year. 
People who did long hours for more than a decade were at the greatest risk of stroke, they suggest.
But the UK's Stroke Association said there were lots of things people could do to counteract the effects of long hours, like exercising and eating well.
The researchers, from Angers University and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, looked at data on age, smoking and working hours from a population study of more than 143,000 adults.
Just under a third worked long hours, with 10% working long hours for 10 years or more.
Overall, 1,224 had had a stroke.
Writing in the American Heart Association's journal Stroke, the researchers say people working long hours had a 29% greater risk of stroke, and those doing so for 10 years or more had a 45% greater risk.
Part-time workers and those who suffered strokes before working long hours were excluded from the study.
Dr Alexis Descatha, who led the research added: ""The association between 10 years of long work hours and stroke seemed stronger for people under the age of 50. This was unexpected. Further research is needed to explore this finding.
""As a clinician, I will advise my patients to work more efficiently and I plan to follow my own advice.""
This study looked at numbers, rather than reasons, but other research has found people who run their own businesses, CEOs and managers seem less affected by long hours - as opposed to those working irregular shifts and nights, or who have job-related stress. 
Dr Richard Francis, head of research at the Stroke Association, said: ""There are lots of simple things you can do to reduce the risk of a stroke, even if you work long hours. 
""Eating a healthy diet, finding the time to exercise, stopping smoking and getting the recommended amount of sleep can make a big difference to your health.""",,,,

Mike Simpson, 62, from Durham, says his cancer is now ""on the run"".
The therapy, called CAR-T, is a ""living drug"" that is tailor-made for each patient using their body's own cells 
Doctors at King's College Hospital, London, said some patients were being completely cured in a way that had ""never been seen before"". 
CAR-T is the pinnacle of personalised medicine as it has to be developed for each individual patient. 
Firstly, parts of the immune system - specifically white blood cells called T-cells - are removed from the patient's blood.
They are frozen in liquid nitrogen and sent to laboratories in the United States. 
There, the white blood cells are genetically reprogrammed so that rather than killing bacteria and viruses, they will seek out and destroy cancer. 
They are now ""chimeric antigen receptor T-cells"" - or CAR-T cells.
Millions of the modified cells are grown in the lab, before being shipped back to the UK where they are infused into the patient's bloodstream. 
The whole manufacturing process takes a month. 
As this is a ""living drug"", the cancer-killing T-cells stay in the body for a long time and will continue to grow and work inside the patient.
Mike Simpson was one of the first NHS patients to be treated. 
He was diagnosed with large B-cell lymphoma - a type of blood cancer - in 2015 when he returned from a holiday with a stiff and swollen neck. 
Two bouts of chemotherapy initially controlled his cancer, but each time it returned. 
By the end of 2018, he was given less than two, unpleasant and probably painful, years to live. 
""If this treatment wasn't offered to me, I'd be saying goodbye in a relatively short period of time,"" he told the BBC.
He started the treatment in February and follow-up scans show the CAR-T therapy is working.
He added: ""I feel the treatment really is being effective, that we've got the cancer pretty much on the run.
""Obviously I'm really happy about that and optimistic for the future and glad that I committed to the treatment.""
However, it is still too soon to know whether the therapy has been completely successful.
Up to 200 patients a year like Mike could benefit from the therapy. 
This is a new therapy and very long-term data is still lacking.
Clinical trials have shown that 40% of patients had all signs of their otherwise untreatable, terminal lymphoma eliminated from their body 15 months after treatment.
""It is a very exciting new development and it gives new hope to a lot of our patients,"" Victoria Potter, consultant haematologist at King's College Hospital told the BBC.
She added: ""It's amazing to be able to see these people, who you may have not been able to give any hope to, actually achieving remission. 
""And that is a situation we have never seen before and it's an incredibly impressive change in the treatment paradigm.""
Mike says the side-effects of his treatment were worse than either of his two batches of chemotherapy. 
Short-term neurotoxicity, where the brain and nerves are affected, can lead to confusion, difficultly speaking and a loss of consciousness.
There are five days after the treatment, when Mike was on intensive care, that he cannot remember at all. 
Other side-effects include fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. 
""It might be a magic bullet, but it hurts,"" said Mike.
His brain function is back to normal, but Mike says fatigue means he's not ready to go back to work. 
This truly personalised medicine - made from and for each individual patient - is unsurprisingly expensive.
The official list price for this CAR-T therapy, called Yescarta, is more than £280,000 per patient. 
A deal has been struck between NHS England and the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, but how much this is costing remains confidential.
Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said: ""CAR-T shows huge promise and it is fantastic to see that patients in the NHS are among the first in the world to benefit. 
""The start of this treatment marks the beginning of a new era of personalised medicine.""
CAR-T has so far shown the most promise in blood cancers including types of lymphoma and leukaemia. 
The first NHS patient to receive it was 11-year-old Yuvan Thakkar, who has a form of leukaemia.
""Solid cancers"" - those that form tumours like lung cancer or melanoma - have been more challenging.
One reason the blood cancer work has been easier is down to acceptable collateral damage.
CAR-T cells have to target proteins that stick out from the surface of a cancerous cell.
Cancerous B-cells (a type of immune cell in the blood) have a protein called CD19 on the outside, but so too do healthy B cells. 
So CAR-T therapies that currently target CD19 are wiping out healthy and cancerous cells. 
This is an acceptable amount of collateral damage as the rest of the immune system is still there and drugs can help plug the gap. 
The same is not true in other cancers - you cannot destroy the lungs to kill lung cancer, or the skin to kill melanoma.
So more precise targets are being developed and are entering clinical trials.

When you have a health concern, who do you turn to?
A Wellcome Trust survey recently found that 73% of people around the world would most trust a doctor or nurse for medical advice. In the UK, that figure stands at more than 90%.
According to the survey, a person's age and gender has no impact on whom they most trust for medical advice; nor does recent internet use have any bearing.
Education is the only factor measured that affects whom we trust the most to give medical guidance.
Andrew Dugan, from Gallup - the analytics company that conducted the global survey - said: ""People who had only completed primary education were much less likely than those with the equivalent of a university or college degree to trust a doctor or nurse the most. 
This trend was noticeable even after taking into account how wealthy a country is.""
More than a quarter of people surveyed globally said they would most trust someone other than a doctor or nurse for health advice. The most common alternative was family and friends.
Beyond Today: What happens when you get health advice from Instagram?
In 10 countries - six of them in Africa - at least one in 10 people place their greatest trust in 'traditional healers' when seeking medical advice. 
In Niger, one in five people said they would trust a religious leader the most.
People in these countries were typically among the least trusting of scientists, doctors or nurses. 
Health misinformation in Africa has long been a concern. The fact-checking organisation Africa Check was set up in the wake of misinformation spread in Nigeria about the polio vaccine.
Africa Check's Lee Mwiti said the scale of false health claims that their teams encounter in the four countries where they work is significant, among them debunking quack cancer cures and rumours of ""life-saving cough CPR"". 
Mr Mwiti said the spread of misinformation was ""of great concern on the continent because people do change their behaviour on the strength of their implied claims"".
Social media has given rise to a range of wellness vloggers and bloggers, dispensing health advice despite limited medical experience.
Often search engines play a key role when ruminating over a health concern - so do the big tech firms do anything to ensure people seeking help online receive reliable information?
In a statement, Google said: ""Our goal with Search is to deliver relevant results from the most reliable sources available and, particularly for sensitive topics like health, we have refined our systems to prioritise results from more authoritative sources.""
Yet, when it comes to vaccines, the survey suggests internet searches seem to fuel mistrust in official advice.
""People who have sought information about science, medicine or health in the last 30 days are less likely to agree that vaccines are safe,"" says Lara Clements, from the Wellcome Trust.
""It raises interesting questions about whether they are finding the information they need or whether the information they are finding is making them more hesitant about vaccine safety.""
Read more about the results of the Wellcome Global Monitor.
People in the UK showed relatively strong trust in vaccines, compared with the rest of Europe. 
Last year Public Health England found that 93% of parents in England have confidence in the immunisation program. Their survey asked which sources people trust for information about immunisation: social media, the internet and the media in general were trusted the least.

Experts warn public mistrust of vaccines means the world is taking a step backwards in the fight against preventable infectious diseases, and a study by the World Health Organisation, the biggest global study into people's attitudes on immunisation, shows trust is worryingly low in some regions. 
The BBC World Service has been looking at the issue across the globe in three days of special coverage.  
Prof Beate Kampmann, director of the Vaccine Centre at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, answers questions about vaccinations sent in by readers of BBC News, following a Facebook Live question-and-answer session on Wednesday.
Diane: How do you inform the misinformed?
There is no easy answer. The problem is the misinformed tend to communicate with each other and perpetuate the misinformation. 
There is a lot of objective vaccine information available from Public Health England, for example, which can be accessed via their website. Vaccine centres - like ours at the London School, or the one at the University of Oxford - will also have spaces for people to look up information which has been put there by scientists.
Threlsar: Is there any standard vaccination to prevent tuberculosis?
The only vaccine in use is BCG and it works, but not well enough. We are trying very hard to make a better one but it's taking time.
Sharena: Is there any vaccine for dengue fever?
Yes, but it cannot be given to very young children.
Asmah: Is the HPV vaccine only effective for young women who aren't sexually active?
Ideally the vaccine should prevent infection with the human papilloma viruses, and that is best done before women - or men- become sexually active. This is the priority of the HPV vaccination program right now.
Myrddin: Do children get more jabs in America?
You mean in comparison to the UK? No, the same vaccines are recommended as in many other countries. 
Sometimes the preparations vary but essentially the vaccines work against the same diseases. 
If you compare with some other, less resourceful countries then, yes, kids in the USA will get more vaccines than kids in, let's say, Liberia.
Marjolein: Why does the NHS not recommend vaccination for adults who are unvaccinated unless they are travelling to an area with an outbreak?
In the context of the measles outbreak actually it has been recommended that anyone who has not had two doses of the vaccine should get vaccinated, no matter what their age.
Yvonne: Why do they insist on mixing all the vaccines together? And how much research has gone into the long term effects of mixing three or four vaccines together?
The idea of mixing the vaccines together is to prevent too many injections. Each time vaccines are combined they need to be tested to check they do not interfere with each other and all remains safe and effective. Only then are the combination vaccines licensed. 
People worry about ""overload"" but this isn't an issue - just by going out onto the London tube we are exposed to thousands of germs every day. 
Even if a child was given 10 vaccines at once, it would only use about a thousandth of their immune system.
Jean: Why can't we give separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella? Surely that would alleviate some parental concerns and increase uptake of vaccination?
It makes no sense as far as the body's immune response is concerned, and it requires multiple injections- not too nice for the kids. There really is no need to split these components - the combination is safe and effective and we need to put this issue to bed. 
Jack: Why do you think people are so afraid of vaccines? Who could possibly benefit?
I think their insights into the serious consequences of diseases have reduced so much because we do not see them anymore in countries where vaccines have been regularly used for a long time. Hence, people only see they might have a sore arm or a bit of a fever but cannot compare that against the experience of the ""real"" disease. 
It would be a shame to have to wait until the diseases are back to convince people vaccines actually work and have already saved countless lives.
Jim: Do vaccines work as well for older people?
As we age so do our immune systems and the memory, not just in the brain! Hence, we sometimes do not respond to vaccines - or infections - in the same way as when we were young. 
We are doing research to see how we can best optimise the vaccines for the elderly, as they also need protection, and be effective at any stage of life.
Kam: Why isn't it a legal requirement for vaccines to be given?
It is in some countries but in the UK it is not mandatory as we believe the evidence is so good that people should be persuaded. 
There might be situations where that has to change but for now it would be good to win the argument through persuasion.
Maggy: Why isn't it mandatory for children to be vaccinated before attending any schooling?
Not in the UK - it is in the US, Australia, currently in Italy also- it's a bit of a moving field
Jaafar: What safety guides do companies follow in making these vaccines? And how do we know that said company is a reliable company?
In order to gain licensure, international regulatory authorities such as the FDA (USA) and the EMA (Europe) have to approve the product - this can only happen when the international safety standards are met.
Alvin: Does the vaccine wear out? And are the vaccines properly tested? 
Vaccines have to conform to international safety standards. Their production is monitored and the clinical trials before they can get a license are done to international so-called good clinical practice.
Vaccines have a sell-by date for a specific batch that was made in the factory and need to be used before that's come up.
Protection can wear out for some vaccines, which is why we often need so called ""boosters"" to refresh the memory of the immune system and generate more antibodies. How many doses are needed throughout life depends on the type of vaccine.",,,,

A ban on energy drink sales to under-16s, clearer calorie labelling and a crackdown on junk food advertising were all promised by ministers when they launched the revamped obesity strategy.
But a year on none of the key measures has been introduced in England.
Both Labour and campaigners said it showed progress had stopped - but the government said it was still on track.
Among the steps being highlighted by Labour and the Obesity Health Alliance are:
Ministers promised each would be consulted on by the end of 2018.
But the government has yet to commit to any of them - with the voucher scheme still to be discussed.
Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, acknowledged work had been done despite the ""complex political environment"", but she added more action was needed quickly if the government was to achieve its target of halving childhood obesity by 2030.
""The clock is ticking,"" she said.
Labour's shadow public health minister, Sharon Hodgson, said it represented ""snail's pace progress"" by a government distracted by the ""botched Brexit negotiations"".
""One year on since the plan was published, the government's so-called commitments to childhood obesity remains mere window dressing,"" she said.
But ministers maintained progress was being made, pointing to the introduction of a tax on sugary drinks as a sign of the government's commitment.
The Department of Health and Social Care used the one-year anniversary of the refreshed strategy - the original one was published in 2016, but updated two years later to include clear commitments on action - to trumpet projects that were getting under way in local areas with the help of councils.
They include:

1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48756732,"An experimental new urine test can reveal if men with early prostate cancer will probably need aggressive therapy or can be left untreated but monitored, UK researchers say.
Current PSA blood tests cannot do this, meaning many men experience unnecessary worry, investigations and treatment.
The prostate urine risk (PUR) test looks for genetic markers to give a more accurate assessment.
Trials in 537 patients suggest it can reliably sort men by risk.
It is one of a number of new tests - including other urine-based ones, as well as blood tests and scans - scientists are pursuing to improve prostate cancer detection.
A combination of checks rather than one single test may ultimately prove to be the best approach, experts say.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer affecting men in the UK, with 47,000 new cases a year. 
A PSA test can give confusing results, which is why routine prostate screening is not yet offered to men. 
About 75% or three in every four men who get a positive PSA test result are not found to have cancer when they go for a follow-up biopsy. 
And PSA misses the cancer in about 15% of men with prostate cancer.
It also cannot show whether a cancer will probably go on to cause harm. 
Prostate cancer often grows slowly to start with and may never cause any problems. 
But men with aggressive tumours need treatment to stop it spreading.
Shea Connell, who led the research, at the University of East Anglia and the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, said a bigger trial was now planned. 
He hopes the urine test could become available for doctors to use within three years - as an add-on to PSA testing. 
""Prostate cancer is more commonly a disease men die with rather than from,"" he said.
""Unfortunately, we currently lack the ability to tell which men diagnosed with prostate cancer will need radical treatment and which men will not.
""A policy of 'active surveillance' has been developed as a way to combat this uncertainty but it requires invasive follow-ups and constant reminders that a patient has a cancer with an uncertain natural history.
""This results in up to 50% of men on active surveillance self-electing for treatment - whether they need it or not.
""It's clear that there is a considerable need for additional, more accurate, tests.""
Georgina Hill, from Cancer Research UK, said the findings, published in BJU International, were ""promising"" but needed confirming in more patients before the test could be offered routinely. 
Dr David Montgomery, from Prostate Cancer UK, said: ""More research now needs to be done to see how accurate this is compared to the newer, non-invasive methods being offered, such as multi-parametric MRI scans.""",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48752929,"San Francisco has become the first US city to ban sales of e-cigarettes until their health effects are clearer.
Officials on Tuesday voted to ban stores selling the vaporisers and made it illegal for online retailers to deliver to addresses in the city.
The Californian city is home to Juul Labs, the most popular e-cigarette producer in the US.
Juul said the move would drive smokers back to cigarettes and ""create a thriving black market"".
San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, has 10 days to sign off the legislation, but has indicated she will. The law would begin to be enforced seven months from that date, although there have been reports firms could mount a legal challenge.
Anti-vaping activists say firms deliberately target young people by offering flavoured products. Not only is more scientific investigation into the health impact needed, critics say, but vaping can encourage young people to switch to cigarettes.
Earlier this year the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the national regulator, issued proposed guidelines giving companies until 2021 to apply to have their e-cigarette products evaluated.
A deadline had initially been set for August 2018, but the agency later said more preparation time was needed.
San Francisco's City Attorney, Dennis Herrera, who campaigned for a ban, praised the move and said it was necessary because of an ""abdication of responsibility"" by the FDA in regulating e-cigarettes.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of US teenagers who admitted using nicotine products rose about 36% last year, something it attributed to a growth in e-cigarette use.
Under federal law, the minimum age to buy tobacco products is 18 years, although in California and several other states it is 21. 
Juul previously said it supported cutting vaping among young people but only in conjunction with tougher measures to stop them accessing regular cigarettes.
The company's small device, just longer than a flash drive, has about 70% of the US vaping market.
San Francisco's ban would ""drive former adult smokers who successfully switched to vapor products back to deadly cigarettes"", said Juul spokesman Ted Kwong. It would also stop adult smokers switching and create a ""thriving black market"".
""We have already taken the most aggressive actions in the industry to keep our products out of the hands of those underage and are taking steps to do more."" 
Traditional tobacco products will ""remain untouched by this legislation, even though they kill 40,000 Californians every year,"" he said. 
Juul, 35%-owned by Marlboro maker Altria Group, has already withdrawn popular flavours such as mango and cucumber from retail stores and closed its social media channels on Instagram and Facebook.",,,,
1906,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48770808,"San Francisco has become the first US city to ban sales of e-cigarettes. Yet in the UK they are used by the NHS to help smokers quit - so what is the truth about the safety of e-cigarettes?
They work by heating up a liquid that usually contains nicotine, propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerine, and flavourings. 
Users inhale the vapour produced, which contains nicotine - the addictive element in cigarettes.
But nicotine is relatively harmless compared with the many poisonous chemicals contained in tobacco smoke, such as tar and carbon monoxide.
Nicotine does not cause cancer - unlike tobacco in normal cigarettes, which kills thousands of smokers every year.
That's why nicotine replacement therapy has been used for many years by the NHS to help people stop smoking, in the form of gum, skin patches and sprays.
Doctors, public health experts, cancer charities and governments in the UK all agree that, based on the current evidence, e-cigarettes carry a fraction of the risk of cigarettes. 
One independent review concluded vaping was about 95% less harmful than smoking. Professor Ann McNeill, who wrote the review, said ""e-cigarettes could be a game changer in public health"".
However, that doesn't mean they are completely risk free. 
The liquid and vapour in e-cigarettes can contain some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke, but at much lower levels.
In a small, early study in the lab, UK scientists found the vapour could lead to changes in the lung's immune cells.
It is still too early to work out the potential health effects of vaping - but experts agree they will be significantly lower than cigarettes.
There is currently no evidence that vaping can harm other people.
Compared with the proven harms of second-hand tobacco smoke, or passive smoking, the health risks of e-cigarette vapour are negligible.
In the UK, there are much tighter rules on the content of e-cigs than in the US.
Nicotine content is capped, for example, just to be on the safe side, whereas in the US it is not.
The UK also has stricter regulations on how they are advertised, where they are sold and to whom - there is a ban on sale to under-18s, for example.
The UK is taking a very different approach to the US on e-cigarettes - but its position is very similar to that of Canada and New Zealand.
The UK government views e-cigarettes as an important tool to help smokers give up their habit - and the NHS may even consider prescribing them free to those who want to quit.
So there is no chance of sales of e-cigarettes being banned, as in San Francisco.
There, the focus is on preventing young people from taking up vaping rather than reducing the numbers of people who smoke.
A recent report from Public Health England found that quitting smoking was the main reason for people to use e-cigarettes.
It also says there is no evidence they are acting as a gateway into smoking for young people.
Professor Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK's expert in cancer prevention, says the ""overall evidence points to e-cigarettes actually helping people to give up smoking tobacco"".
There are signs that rules on e-cigarettes in the UK could be relaxed further.
With smoking rates falling to about 15% in the UK, a committee of MPs has suggested bans on vaping in some buildings and on public transport should be relaxed.",,,,

Vaccination against the human papilloma virus, which causes most cervical cancers, began over a decade ago.
A Lancet review of 65 studies covering 60 million people showed a fall in HPV cases and in pre-cancerous growths.
Over decades, this should translate into a significant fall, and possible eradication, of the cancer they said.
Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust said the data should boost faith in the jab.
Source: NHS Choices
There are 3,200 cases of cervical cancer and 850 deaths from the disease each year.
The review covered studies in 14 high-income countries, including the UK. They looked at HPV rates, plus cases of genital warts and pre-cancerous cells in the cervix called CIN.
It found that when rates were compared before vaccination started and eight years after:
It also showed people who were not vaccinated benefited. Cases of genital warts in boys aged 15-19 fell by almost 50%, and also significantly in women over 30.
Rates fell more in countries where a wider age group was vaccinated and where coverage was higher.
Public Health England principal scientist Dr David Mesher said: ""We are seeing reductions in HPV strains and in cervical disease as well, so there is every suggestion there will be reductions in cervical cancers too.""
Prof Marc Brisson, from Laval University, Canada, who led the review, said: ""We will see reductions in women aged 20-30 within the next 10 years.""
He said cervical cancer elimination - defined as fewer than four cases per 100,000 - ""might be possible if sufficiently high vaccination coverage can be achieved and maintained"".
Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust said the findings ""clearly showed"" the impact of HPV vaccination.
""This study furthers the growing evidence to counteract those who don't believe that this vaccine works, which is now extremely encouraging,"" said chief executive Robert Music.
""We sincerely hope this will boost public faith in the HPV vaccine, so that more lives can be saved and we get closer to a world where cervical cancer is a thing of the past.""",,,,

It warns that even baby food marked ""no added sugar"" often contains sugars from honey or fruit juice.
Parents should offer bitter flavours too, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health recommends.
This will guard against tooth decay, poor diet and obesity.
The recommendation is one of many included in a report on how to improve the health of children in the UK.
Reducing child obesity is a key priority in all parts of the UK, with England and Scotland committing to halving rates by 2030.
Targeting food high in sugar and fat is an important part of that aim, following the introduction of a tax on sugary drinks in England in 2018.
The report says the government should introduce mandatory limits on the amount of free sugar in baby foods.
Many can contain high levels of sugar added by the manufacturer or present in syrups and fruit juices, it says, despite labels suggesting otherwise.
The report says infants should not be given sugary drinks. Instead, they should have sugar in a natural form, such as whole fresh fruit, milk or unsweetened dairy products.
Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said products for weaning babies often contained a high proportion of fruit or sweet-tasting vegetables.
""Pureed or liquid baby foods packaged in pouches also often have a high energy density and a high proportion of sugar,"" she said.
""If sucked from the pouch, the baby also misses out on the opportunity to learn about eating from a spoon or feeding himself.  
""Baby foods can be labelled 'no added sugar' if the sugar comes from fruit - but all sugars have the same effects on the teeth and on metabolism.""
She said babies had a preference for sweet tastes but parents should not reinforce that.
""Babies are very willing to try different flavours, if they're given the chance,"" Prof Fewtrell said, ""and it's important that they're introduced to a variety of flavours, including more bitter tasting foods such as broccoli and spinach, from a young age.""
Prof Fewtrell also said parents should be educated on the impact of sugar. 
""Excess sugar is one of the leading causes of tooth decay, which is the most common oral disease in children, affecting nearly a quarter (23%) of five-year-olds."" 
She added that sugar intake also contributed to children becoming overweight and obese.
The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition recommends sugar provides no more than 5% of daily total energy intake for those aged two and over, and even less for children under two. 
But results from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey suggest the average daily intake for the children between one-and-a-half and three years is 11.3% - more than double the recommended amount.
A review of food and drinks aimed at young children, by Public Health England, found that processed dried fruit products contained the highest amount of sugar - but were often marketed as healthy snacks.
The products, which contain fruit juices, purees and concentrates, making them high in free sugars, should not be sold as suitable snacks for children, PHE said.",,,,

Officials are to discuss proposals to stop or reduce 17 routine procedures deemed to be ""ineffective or risky"". The treatment will be offered only if it is judged to be of ""compelling"" benefit and there are no alternatives.  NHS England said the move would affect about 100,000 people every year and free up an estimated ¬£200m.  The British Society for Surgery of the Hand (BSSH) said cutting back on certain procedures would cost the economy more as people would be unable to work without surgery. Patients at risk of serious harm from their condition will continue to be offered treatment. It follows reviews last year to save ¬£190m from supplying over-the-counter medications and treatments described as ""low value"". The announcement comes as thousands of people gathered in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS and demonstrate against cuts to the health service.  Organisers of the rally, which include the People's Assembly - which campaigns against austerity cuts - and unions, are calling for more money for the NHS. NHS England says for most of the 17 procedures under consideration, alternative treatments including physiotherapy, a minor injection or change of diet are likely to be effective.  It says the savings made by not carrying out the procedures will be reinvested in better frontline cancer, mental health and other critical services. Its national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said: ""If we want the very best clinical care for our patients, we need to stop putting them through treatments where risks and harms outweigh the benefits.  ""By reducing unnecessary or risky procedures for some patients we can get better outcomes while reducing waste and targeting resource to where it is most needed.""   The plans have the backing of health professionals and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which advises on the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of treatments. It is proposed four treatments will be offered only when a patient makes an individual request. These include surgery for snoring, where there is said to be only limited clinical evidence of effectiveness and which poses significant risks to patients. The others are: dilatation and curettage for heavy menstrual bleeding, knee arthroscopies for osteoarthritis and injections for non-specific back pain.  A further 13 procedures will only to be offered when specific criteria are met: NHS England plans to consult publicly on the proposals between 4 July and 28 September, with changes planned to start in 2019-20. Some have criticised the plans.  Samantha Lilley, 29, was born with a rare genetic condition called epidermal nevus syndrome, which causes skin lesions.   Throughout her life she has had procedures to help the physical and mental suffering but is worried about whether those would be discontinued. She said: ""They're not life threatening, but they're painful and unsightly, to leave them would be detrimental to my health."" She added: ""My condition is lifelong. Is this what the NHS is now - that you must be at death's door to receive treatment? This isn't what it was created for - its purpose was to improve the quality of life of British citizens.""  Matthew Bennett from Bracknell, Berkshire, said having grommets for glue ear fitted when he was a boy fully restored his hearing. He also said his brother benefited hugely from an operation after severe tonsillitis meant he missed time at university time and lost him a job.  Mr Bennett said: ""If he hadn't had his tonsils out recently, he'd probably still be struggling with work."" Anthony Stuart, a 52-year-old artist blacksmith, has Dupuytren's contracture - where fingers become permanently bent or flexed - and has had surgery on one of his hands to correct this.  He is due to have another procedure to try to correct his other hand in July. He said the treatment had a huge positive impact on his condition.  ""I'm astounded that the government can call treatment for Dupuytren's ineffective,"" added Mr Stuart.  ""My consultant says if people don't have this procedure it could lead to amputation, which is even more costly to the NHS.""  GP Brian Hope said he hoped publishing the list would make people come up with healthier solutions to certain problems. He added: ""We have still got to try and get people to think, 'Wait a minute, could I do something myself - lose weight, be more active?' BSSH President David Shewring said conditions such as Mr Stuart's could force people to take time off work or stop altogether. He also said it was ""wrong"" to brand such procedures unnecessary or risky and did patients a ""huge disservice"". Physiotherapist Lucy Macdonald also welcomed the plans, saying she was pleased knee arthroscopies and shoulder decompressions would be limited, ""because for a long time research has shown they are largely ineffective"".  Academy of Medical Royal Colleges chairwoman Prof Carrie MacEwen said the changes would benefit patients, clinicians and the NHS as a whole ""by reducing harm and targeting those who will benefit most"".",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44575139,"Think of magic mushrooms and LSD and it's likely that science is not the first thing that springs to mind. Psychedelic drugs are more likely to be associated with hippies and the counterculture of the 1960s than people in white lab coats and clinical trials. But that might soon change. Increasingly, scientists are looking at whether these mind-altering drugs - which also include mescaline and DMT among others - might also have the potential to be mind-healing.  A number of small studies have found psychedelics to show promise in treating mental health disorders like depression, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, often where other treatments have failed. Now UK researchers are about to take part in the first major trials into whether one of these hallucinogenic drugs could be more effective than a leading antidepressant in the treatment of depression. Researchers at Imperial College London are to compare the magic mushroom compound psilocybin with a leading SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) antidepressant, escitalopram, in a large trial expected to take at least two years. ""[Psychedelics] have a revolutionary potential, and that's not an exaggeration,"" says Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, who will lead the study. But it is not the first time scientists have been excited about these mind-bending substances. More than 50 years ago they rapidly came to scientific attention, before research in the field came to a sudden halt. During the 1950s and 60s psychedelics were considered to be a promising potential treatment for numerous mental health disorders, with more than 1,000 studies taking place. But the drugs quickly became controversial. Popularised by musicians and other celebrities, the recreational use of psychedelics, and particularly LSD, spread during the 1960s as they became increasingly associated with the countercultural movements of the time.  Press coverage of the drugs often focused on bad trips and the supposed moral degeneracy they induced rather than developments in the scientific field. Some scientists - notably former Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary - became evangelical about the benefits of the drugs, blurring the boundaries between science and advocacy. Amid fears about their safety and a growing moral panic, psychedelic drugs were made illegal in the US in 1968. A further UN convention on the drugs in 1971 effectively ended scientific research, because it led member states to make them illegal and classify them as Schedule 1 drugs - those deemed to have no medicinal benefit. For decades, research dried up as scientists moved into other areas, not least the study of antidepressants.  With special government approval needed for such studies, many scientists turned their attention to the magic mushroom compound psilocybin, a drug that is similar to LSD but without much of the controversy. Several pioneering studies into psychedelics were carried out during the 1990s. But it was not until the mid-2000s that the drugs underwent a scientific renaissance, in part because of the work carried out at Johns Hopkins University in the US. Studies from the university found that psilocybin reduced depression in 80% of patients with life-threatening cancer and, separately, were much more effective at getting people to quit smoking than current treatments when combined with cognitive behavioural therapy.  In 2009, Dr Carhart-Harris became the first UK scientist in more than 40 years to research psychedelics, beginning a series of studies using scanners to see how psilocybin affects the brain. Among other findings, a study from his team last year found that psilocybin can ""reset"" the brains of people with untreatable depression. The paper, published in the journal Scientific Reports, showed psilocybin affected two areas of the brain: The amygdala, which is heavily involved in how we process emotions such as fear and anxiety, and the default-mode network - a collaboration of different brain regions. How psilocybin affects the brain is not yet fully understood, but Dr Carhart-Harris believes it effectively ""heats up"" the mind from its rigidity, enabling people to overcome ingrained, self-destructive patterns of thinking.  With support from a therapist, those who have undergone the treatment can then ""recalibrate in a healthier way, so you're revising your beliefs and assumptions and addictions"", Dr Carhart-Harris says. But psychedelics are not without risks.  While psilocybin is not thought to be toxic for the body, bad trips can be frightening and can potentially cause people to come to harm because of a loss of control. They can also exacerbate underlying mental health problems and may lead to psychotic reactions in people who are already predisposed to them. There are also differences between using the drugs recreationally and in the safety of a scientific trial.  Scientists use pure, medical-grade drugs, offer guidance and support with the experience and exclude people at risk of a psychotic reaction.  And the studies so far have tended to be small and short, without placebo groups to account for the placebo effect.  Dr James Rucker, a clinical lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, is due to begin trials to improve the evidence around whether psilocybin is safe. It is an essential step if the drug is ever to be licensed and prescribed by doctors. But even if the trials show psilocybin is safe and effective, Dr Rucker says it is likely to take a minimum of five years and probably longer before psilocybin could be licensed for use.  The process for getting drugs approved is notoriously slow, expensive and bureaucratic, he says.  So could psychedelics prove to be a breakthrough treatment, capable of transforming mental health?  Dr Carhart-Harris acknowledges that even if bigger trials confirm psychedelics are effective, they are not going to be for everyone.  ""Some people won't want to go to the depths of their soul or face demons or traumas they've experienced, or dark aspects of the human condition that are there in all of us,"" he says. Dr Rucker says no treatment in psychiatry is helpful for everyone.  ""It's about strings to the bow, and it's about having a range of things you can offer,"" he says. ""This may be one of those things, but who knows? Let's see what the evidence says.""  Follow Alex on Twitter.",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44659289,"Scientists have taken early steps towards developing an artificial ovary that could lead to improved fertility preservation treatments. The technique is aimed at helping women at risk of becoming infertile, such as those who receive chemotherapy. The Danish scientists removed parts of the ovary and altered them so they could potentially be transplanted later when the woman wants to conceive. Experts say the work is ""exciting"" but human testing is still needed.  Treatments for cancer, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can often damage the ovaries and leave women infertile.  One way women can preserve their chances of conceiving is with an ovarian tissue transplant, where all or part of the ovary is removed and frozen before it is damaged so that it can be used at a later date.  This is the only fertility preservation treatment available for girls who have not started ovulating.  But there is a small risk that in those with cancer the ovarian tissue may contain cancerous cells, raising the chances of the illness returning when the transplant takes place. This risk, although ""very low"", means women with certain forms of cancer, such as leukaemia and those originating in the womb, are unlikely to be offered the transplant.  To eliminate that risk, scientists from the Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark, took ovarian follicles and ovarian tissue from patients due to have cancer treatment. They then removed the cancerous cells from the ovarian tissue, leaving behind a ""scaffold"" made up of proteins and collagen. Scientists were then able to grow the ovarian follicles on this engineered scaffold of ovarian tissue.  This artificial ovary was then transplanted into mice, where it was able to support the survival and growth of the ovarian cells.  Experts said the ""exciting"" technique needed to be tested in humans. But they said it might have advantages over other fertility treatments. Stuart Lavery, consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, said the ovarian tissue transplants potentially contained thousands of eggs that would enable women to get pregnant ""naturally"", as opposed to IVF where an egg is fertilised in a laboratory and then returned to the womb.  Dr Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midlands Fertility Services, said another advantage of ovarian tissue transplants is that they could enable women to restart their periods after damaging treatments, preventing the need for hormone replacement therapy.  The treatment will need to be tested in humans first - a development expected to take place in the next three to four years.  The research is being presented at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.",,,,

The woman was taken to Carletonville morgue, in Gauteng province, having been declared dead by paramedics following a road accident. Ambulance company Distress Alert said she had shown ""no form of life"", South Africa's TimesLive website reports. But when a morgue worker returned to check on the body in the fridge, he found the woman was breathing. An official has confirmed to the BBC the woman is now being treated in a hospital east of Johannesburg after being referred by forensics officers. She has not been named. An investigation into the incident is being carried out, with the family demanding answers.

Treatments including blood transfusions infected thousands of patients with HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970s and 1980s. It has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. The terms of reference have now been published by the judge chairing the public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff.  In a letter to the Minister for the Cabinet Office, David Lidington, Sir Brian said it would consider what had happened and why and the response of government and others. Many of those affected and their families say they were not told of the risks involved. Patients in other countries were also infected. It was revealed on Monday that the process of gathering evidence would begin this week and the inquiry would take between two and four years.   The first public hearings involving victims and their families will be in late September but the inquiry is likely then to hold private sessions until the new year. Sir Brian said: ""What is difficult to comprehend is the sheer scale of what happened.  ""The numbers of people, both adults and children, from all walks of life, who were infected by Hepatitis viruses, or HIV, from clotting factor or transfused blood runs into thousands.  ""At least as many more - including partners, children, parents, families, friends or carers - have been affected. ""This may have happened principally in the 1970s and 1980s but the consequences persist today with people continuing to feel the mental, physical, social, work-related and financial effects.

""I aim to put the people who have been infected and affected at the heart of this inquiry.

He urged people with knowledge or personal experience who might be able to help the inquiry to come forward.   Campaigners who have fought for decades for a full independent investigation welcomed the announcement by Sir Brian.    Jason Evans was just four years old when his father, Jonathan, a haemophiliac, died after being infected with HIV through a contaminated blood product.

The treatment boosts the action of white blood cells, called macrophages, that the immune system uses to gobble up unwanted invaders. Tests in mice showed the therapy worked for aggressive breast and skin tumours, Nature Biomedical Engineering journal reports.  The US team behind the study hope to begin human trials within a few years.  The drug that they designed already has a licence, which they say should hasten the approval process.  It is a ""supramolecule"" - a drug built from component molecules that fit together like building blocks.  Treatments that target the immune system to fight cancer are a growing area of research that lots of scientists around the world are investigating. This latest work involves a devouring or ""phagocytic"" immune cell called the macrophage. Macrophages are already good at fighting bacterial and viral infections because they can recognise and attack these ""foreign"" invaders.  But they are not so effective at tackling cancer, since tumours grow from our own cells and have clever mechanisms to hide from immune attack. The drug Dr Ashish Kulkarni and colleagues at Harvard Medical School's Brigham and Women's Hospital used in their study works in two ways.  Firstly, it stops cancer cells from hiding and sending out ""eat me not"" signals to macrophages. Secondly, it prevents the tumour from telling macrophages to turn docile. The supramolecular therapy appeared to stop cancer from growing and spreading in the test mice.  The researchers envisage that it could be used alongside other cancer treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors.  Carl Alexander, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""It's promising to see yet another new approach. More work is now needed to show that this approach could be used to treat cancer patients.""",,,,

The key, they say, is understanding how skin bacteria create the smell from virtually odourless armpit sweat.  Two teams, at the Universities of York and Oxford, say they have now deciphered the first step in this molecular process.  It could pave the way for a new generation of deodorants designed to block this unpleasant chain of events, the journal eLife reports.  Sweat is made by two types of glands on the skin: Even very small traces of the BO chemicals these bacteria produce can smell cheesy, sour, musky and onion-like. Deodorant uses perfume to mask the smell, plus ethanol or an antibacterial agent to kill the bacteria.  Antiperspirants typically contain aluminium chloride, which reduces the amount of sweat released by temporarily plugging the skin pores that lead to the sweat glands. Co-author Dr Gavin Thomas, from the Department of Biology at the University of York, said: ""Modern deodorants act a bit like a nuclear bomb in our underarms, inhibiting or killing many of the bacteria present in order to prevent BO.  ""Only a small number of the bacteria in our armpits are actually responsible for bad smells."" These Staphylococus hominis bacteria use a ""transport"" protein to recognise and swallow up the odourless compounds secreted in sweat that they convert into BO.  And Dr Thomas and colleagues say this could be used as a blueprint to develop a more guided weapon against BO - a new type of spray or roll-on deodorant containing a substance that would stop the transport protein from functioning. Their work was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council along with an industry grant from Unilever.  There are already some practical things you can do to help prevent BO.",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-44612642,"A nine-year-old girl's fatal asthma attack has been linked to illegally high levels of air pollution. Ella Kissi-Debrah lived 25m (80ft) from London's South Circular Road - a notorious pollution ""hotspot"".  She experienced three years of seizures and hospital stays before her death in February 2013. During that time, local air pollution levels breached EU legal limits.  No individual death has previously been directly linked to air pollution.  According to a report by one of the UK's leading experts on asthma and air pollution, Prof Stephen Holgate, there was a ""striking association"" between Ella's emergency hospital admissions and recorded spikes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM10s, the most noxious pollutants.  His report said there was a ""real prospect that without unlawful levels of air pollution, Ella would not have died"". The evidence will be submitted in an appeal to the attorney general to re-open an inquest in to Ella's death. Ella often walked to school along the South Circular Road and Lewisham High Street, a journey that would take 30-40 minutes. Or she would be driven and have to sit for lengthy periods in traffic jams. She was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit that followed a spike in air pollution levels.  She was subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times over three years. Many of these coincided with recorded peaks in air pollution. Pollution linked to one in six deaths 'Asthma is a killer - it took away my miracle daughter' Asthma patients 'not receiving basic care' Her mother, Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, said she had resuscitated Ella between 20 and 30 times while waiting for an ambulance.  She said that Ella had been treated in five separate hospitals but no medical professional had ever explained that air pollution could be making her asthma worse.  ""I need to find out for myself why she died and what the causes are,"" Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said. ""I need this for my other children, in order to protect their health.  ""I also believe there is a public interest in examining her death because if this direct link were made then the health of our children would have to be prioritised over other considerations including the convenience of drivers."" Human rights lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn, from the firm Hodge Jones and Allen, is acting on behalf of the family. She said: ""It doesn't make sense that so much information is now available about the health impact of air pollution and the link to thousands of the deaths in the UK and yet there has been, as yet, no direct link made to an individual death.   ""Ella's case illustrates the hard-hitting human impact of air pollution."" Prof Holgate, from University Hospital Southampton, chaired the government's advisory committee on the effects of air pollution.  In his report, he described exposure to air pollutants as a ""key driver"" of Ella's disease. ""Unlawful levels of air pollution contributed to the cause and seriousness of Ella's asthma in a way that greatly compromised her quality of life and was causative of her fatal asthma attack."" He examined records gathered by a government-monitored air pollution monitoring station in Catford, just one mile from Ella's house, and another three miles from her home.  According to Prof Holgate, the fact the monitoring stations were so close to Ella's house meant the results, when combined with data from King's College London and correlated with Ella's hospital visits, were ""particularly insightful."" Spikes in air pollution coincided with all but one of Ella's hospital admissions.  And she died after one of the ""worst air pollution episodes in her locality.""   Prof Holgate examined other possible causes of Ella's condition but concluded the cause of death should be recorded as acute respiratory failure and severe asthma secondary to air pollution exposure. Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said she had noticed Ella's attacks could be worse when she had been near a busy road, that the fumes would affect her breathing.  If she had been properly advised, she said, she would have looked at moving to a less polluted area and changing Ella's school.  ""I would have made every effort to properly seal the house and close the windows when pollution levels were high,"" Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said. She has younger twins and her son has asthma, although not as seriously as Ella. She believes air pollution affects him.  They now walk a different way to school, through a park instead of along the South Circular.  According to a government report published in 2018, poor air quality has been classified as the largest environmental risk to public health in the UK.  The EU limits on air pollution are set out in Article 13 of the European Directive of 2008. But World Health Organization guidelines indicate that adverse health effects occur at lower levels than the EU limits.  Ms Cockburn said: ""The government has willingly presided over illegal EU air quality limits since 2010 and this ongoing failure is costing lives.  ""There needs to be an immediate sea change in how air pollution is dealt with in our cities. ""I believe there are strong grounds for Ella's inquest to be quashed on the basis that her right to life (Article Two of the Human Rights Act) may have been breached by the government's failure to act in relation to unlawful air pollution levels."" The attorney general's office said: ""In considering whether to grant his consent to an application, the attorney general must be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of the application succeeding in the High Court.""

Prof Dame Sally Davies said there was conclusive evidence of therapeutic benefit of prescribing cannabis-based products for certain medical conditions. That list includes treating: Overall, the report found less evidence for the treatment of epilepsy.  The Home Office recently granted Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley, boys who have rare forms of epilepsy, a short-term licence to allow them access to cannabis oil, which their parents say helps to control their seizures.

It contains a compound found in cannabis called CBD and is exempt from scheduling regulations. US regulators have already approved its use.  There are cannabis-based medicinal products currently available in the UK. Sativex, which contains both CBD and the principal psychoactive component of cannabis THC and is used to treat MS, is listed as a Schedule 4 drug. Raw cannabis and THC are controlled as Schedule 1 drugs as there is currently no recognised medicinal or therapeutic benefit in the UK.

While the message about doing aerobic exercise for a healthy heart and lungs is getting through, people are less clear about the need to look after their overall strength too, it says.  We should all be doing strengthening exercises at least twice a week. Lifting weights is one option, but taking up tennis or dancing also works, says PHE and the Centre for Ageing Better.  Activities offering the most benefit include: Yoga, Tai Chi and cycling are also somewhat good for bones, muscles and balance.  Only one in three men and one in four women is doing enough of the right types of exercise to keep both healthy and strong, say the experts.  Muscle and bone strengthening and balance activity can improve physical and wellbeing at any age and reduce the risk of an early death. It can also help improve health during difficult or life-changing times like pregnancy, menopause, onset of or diagnosis of disease, retirement and recovery from hospitalisation.

Older adults need exercises to maintain what they've hopefully already got and slow the natural decline that happens with age.  Unfit in middle age: Are you doomed?

The study comes amid a decline in sperm counts across the Western world, linked to pollution, smoking and diet.

That's the question being typed into search engines across the world, as people wait to see who President Donald Trump announces as his nomination for the US Supreme Court. He's previously promised to appoint a ""pro-life"" judge. Since Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement, questions have been raised over whether his replacement will overturn Roe v Wade. That landmark Supreme Court ruling legalised abortion across the US in 1973. There's no guarantee, regardless of who is appointed, that Roe v Wade will be overturned, but there has still been an explosion of search interest on Google as to what will happen to abortion access if it does. Because Roe v Wade was a Supreme Court ruling, it governs the whole of the US as a nation. However, each of the 50 states also employs its own rules and practices when it comes to providing women with the option to terminate a pregnancy. At the moment, these rules can't contradict the precedent that was set by Roe v Wade - that a woman has a right to terminate her pregnancy under the freedom of personal choice in family matters, as protected by the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution. In the absence of Roe v Wade, a woman's access to abortion would be affected by the state she lives in. Ultimately, in most - but not all - states, a ban is unlikely come into immediate effect. However, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, 23 states would have the potential to ban abortion outright if Roe v Wade is overturned. ""In nine states (including the District of Columbia), the right to abortion is at risk of loss, and in 19 states, the right to abortion appears secure,"" it says. Using a selection of states as examples, this is how the Supreme Court's future approach to Roe v Wade could affect women living across the US. Overturning Roe v Wade would theoretically make abortion illegal in Louisiana. This is because it is one of four states to have so-called ""trigger laws"" already in place. These are laws which lie in wait, only coming into effect after another law or ruling is amended or overturned. Louisiana has an abortion ban that will spring into action ""the instant or soon after Roe is overturned"", according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""This ban would not require any legal action to go into effect if Roe were reversed."" Limited exceptions would be made, for example, to save the life of the mother, but in all other cases doctors could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $100,000 for providing an abortion. Punishment would only apply to the person providing the abortion,  not the woman having it, according to the Georgetown Law Journal. The other states with similar ""trigger laws"" are North Dakota, South Dakota and Mississippi. Commentators have pointed out that abortion rights have already been rolled back in many states, and more restrictive state laws have made accessing a legal termination more difficult. In 2017, 19 states passed 63 abortion restrictions. Twenty-nine states now have enough restrictions to be considered hostile to abortion rights by the research group Guttmacher Institute. Nationwide, the number of clinics has plunged in the last decade. Seven states are now down to just one. Meanwhile, opponents of abortion protest outside of clinics, trying to persuade patients seeking an abortion not to go through with the procedure. One such demonstrator, Chris Davis, previously told the BBC: ""The abortion debate is becoming prominent because there is no more important issue in life than life itself."" Mr Davis, a father of three who defines himself as a ""strong Christian"", takes part in vigils in Louisiana. ""What we focus on is not necessarily overturning Roe v Wade overnight,"" he said. ""With every woman that changes her mind after talking to us or seeing us pray, Roe v Wade is overturned in a grassroots effort. One woman, one baby at a time"". Elsewhere, reports of intimidation tactics and threats have escalated, according to the National Abortion Federation (NAF), a professional association for abortion doctors that has been compiling statistics since 1977. Threats of violence or death almost doubled at clinics in 2017 while trespassing cases more than tripled from a year earlier. At the opposite end of the scale is California, where inhabitants are deemed to have the least risk of losing abortion access in the event of Roe v Wade being overturned, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.  Here, abortion is protected by the state constitution, separately from federal constitutional rights. ""Abortion would continue to be protected in these states even if Roe fell,"" the Center says. Montana, Minnesota, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Alaska and Florida have similar protections. In addition, California has passed laws which strongly protect a women's right to seek an abortion. Other states with similar laws - but no constitutional protection - include Maine, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware and Hawaii. These laws would continue to provide for women seeking abortion but are seen as ""less secure"" than constitutional protection by the Center for Reproductive Rights  Planned Parenthood, a leading US campaign group and provider of reproductive healthcare, has spoken out in support of Roe v Wade, and continuing legal access to abortion as the debate about who will be appointed to the Supreme Court continues. ""The right to access abortion in this country is on the line,"" said Dawn Laguens, executive vice-president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ""For more than 40 years, access to safe and legal abortion has been the law of the land and the right to control your body is an essential American liberty."" On the spectrum between Louisiana and California sits Wyoming, somewhere near the middle. While it doesn't have laws like Louisiana, which could ban abortion if Roe v Wade is overturned, it also doesn't have any laws that provide additional protections, like California. Members of Wyoming's government and state lawmakers are for the most part anti-choice, meaning - theoretically - they could support plans to restrict access to abortion. Approximately 926,200 abortions were performed in the US in 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute's most recent data. At 2014 abortion rates, one in 20 women (5%) in the US will have an abortion by age 20, about one in five (19%) by age 30 and about one in four (24%) by age 45. The three most common reasons given by women for having an abortion were concern for or responsibility to other individuals; the inability to afford raising a child; and the belief that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents. Half said they did not want to be a single parent or were having problems with their husband or partner. BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44738642,"An HIV vaccine that has the potential to protect people around the world from the virus has shown promising results.  The treatment, which aims to provide immunity against various strains of the virus, produced an anti-HIV immune system response in tests on 393 people, a study in the Lancet found.  It also protected some monkeys from a virus that is similar to HIV.  More testing is now needed to determine if the immune response produced can prevent HIV infection in people.  About 37 million people worldwide live with HIV or Aids, and there are an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year. But despite advances in treatment for HIV, both a cure and a vaccine for the virus have so far remained elusive.  The drug Prep, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is effective at preventing HIV infection, but, unlike a vaccine, it needs to be taken regularly, even daily, to prevent the virus from taking hold.   Inventing a vaccine has proved an immense challenge for scientists, in part because there are so many strains of the virus, but also because HIV is adept at mutating to elude attack from our immune systems. Previous attempts at HIV vaccines have been limited to specific strains of the virus found in certain parts of the world. But for this ""mosaic"" vaccine, scientists have developed a treatment made up of pieces of different HIV viruses. The hope is that it could offer much better protection against the almost unlimited number of HIV strains found across the world.  In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, scientists tested various combinations of the mosaic vaccine in people aged 18 to 50 who did not have HIV and were healthy. The participants, from the US, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand, received four vaccinations over the course of 48 weeks. All of the vaccine combinations produced an anti-HIV immune system response and were found to be safe.  Scientists also carried out a parallel study where they gave rhesus monkeys the vaccine to protect them from getting simian-human immunodeficiency virus - a virus similar to HIV that infects monkeys.  The mosaic vaccine combination that showed the most promise in humans was found to protect 67% of the 72 monkeys from getting the disease. ""These results represent an important milestone,"" said Dan Barouch, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study. However, Prof Barouch also cautioned that the findings needed to be interpreted with caution.  Though the vaccine triggered a response in the immune system of the people who took it, it is not clear if this would be enough to fight off the virus and prevent infection.  ""The challenges in the development of an HIV vaccine are unprecedented, and the ability to induce HIV-specific immune responses does not necessarily indicate that a vaccine will protect humans from HIV infection,"" he added.  Nevertheless, the promising results of the study mean researchers will next test the treatment on 2,600 women in southern Africa who are at risk of getting the illness - one of only five vaccines to make it to this stage of so-called efficacy trials.   Only one vaccine has ever shown evidence of protecting against HIV.  A vaccine tested in Thailand lowered the rate of human infection by 31%, but the effect was considered too low to advance it to common use.  Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said it was early days for the vaccine but the signs were ""promising"". ""However, it's important to be cautious and be clear that there's a lot of work to do before an effective HIV vaccine is readily available."" Dr Brady added that in the meantime there were already tools that were effective for preventing the disease from spreading, such as contraception and treatments for HIV-positive people that prevent them from passing on the virus.

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44738735,"Womb cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women in the UK but very few women recognise the symptoms, according to a cancer charity. Faith Caton, 35, was diagnosed by accident when she and her husband were trying for a baby. ""Cancer was never mentioned - only on the day my tumour was found,"" she says.  The Eve Appeal says womb cancer is very treatable if caught early and that the most common sign is abnormal bleeding. About 9,000 women are diagnosed with womb cancer each year in the UK, making it the most common gynaecological cancer ahead of ovarian and cervical cancer. Most womb cancers occur in women who have gone through the menopause and are in their 50s but, although unusual, it can also affect younger women like Faith. A recent survey of 1,000 UK women found that two out of five didn't know the symptoms. Faith had endometriosis and was having a routine procedure for heavy, irregular periods when she was diagnosed in 2015. ""Everyone was shocked, including the gynaecologist,"" she says. She was told the cancer was aggressive and would require a hysterectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, leaving her hopes of conceiving a child dashed. Instead she had to contend with an early menopause. ""All my plans for my previous life changed overnight. ""The six months of treatment were the longest of my life. ""I was determined to get through but some days I couldn't open my eyes."" A supportive husband and family kept her going and psychological support from the hospital was a real boost. Sharing experiences with other cancer patients online ""who understood what I was going through"" made a huge difference, Faith says. But even when the gruelling treatment was finished, her problems were far from over, she admits. She has experienced depression, and nerve damage as well as bowel problems that have dogged her recovery. Life is going to be different - but Faith can at least talk about it now. ""I now spend my time banging on to my friends about going to see their GP if there's something unusual they notice. ""If I had gone earlier, I could have suffered less and been diagnosed earlier, but I don't like to think about that..."" Before her experience, she says she wouldn't have known anything about womb cancer. The most common symptom of womb cancer, unexpected vaginal bleeding, can include:   However, not all abnormal bleeding is womb cancer so the best advice is to visit your GP to talk about your symptoms. Athena Lamnisos, chief executive officer of the Eve Appeal, says just over a third of womb cancer cases are potentially preventable. ""In simple terms, early diagnosis is vital with womb cancer. The fact is, the earlier it is picked up, the more likely it is to be treated.  ""Let's work together to open up a dialogue, no matter how embarrassing it may be to talk about matters of gynaecology.  ""We need to ensure that more women are aware, and talking, and not afraid to go to their GP.""",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44685874,"For four years, Gavin, 31, struggled to go further than his own doorstep, because of his weight. He first texted BBC Radio 5 live's Afternoon Edition programme in 2016 - and we've spoken to him twice since. This is the story - in his own words - of how he turned his life around and is now looking to the future with renewed hope. The last time I went out unaided was 2014 - it was my parents' wedding vow renewal.  I only really go out my front door to put out a bin bag, in the bin just outside the flat, and that's every few days. Other than that, I don't leave my doorstep. I don't like sitting around and doing nothing.  I'd love to just pick up a football and go down to the field. I want to get back into Sunday league football - but I physically can't do it.  I want to get back into work, anywhere would do, but I physically can't do it. It's painful, physically and mentally. It's not as easy as walking out the door. And if it was, I would've done it a long time ago. When I'm in pain, the pain gets so bad that it's physically crippling.  My weight has always fluctuated. At my heaviest, I was 35 and a half stone (222kg).  Before then, I was working regularly and I was walking to and from work. But then, I lost my job and I stopped playing football.  When the weight started to pile on, that was when my mental health really went down. It's a vicious circle. When I'm depressed, I eat - and when I eat, I'm depressed. I've never had any support for my depression. I've just been put on antidepressants and sent away.  I've had to handle things myself and I think my eating is my way of handling it. I knew I was doing damage to myself - but I couldn't stop myself.  For a long time, I found it difficult walking around. But getting to the point of not being able to go out, that really crept up on me.   When I need to go to doctor for tests, it takes four people to help me down the stairs and into the hospital transport.  I hate sitting indoors. I hate looking at the same four walls 24/7. I hate being the size I am. I'm pretty much in pain everywhere. I get chest pains and I've just been told it's because of my weight. I'm scared that if I have something to eat or if I get up and I do too much, that's it, I'm done. Things people take for granted every day, I struggle with.  My parents are absolutely fantastic. They come over and help tidy up - but I know they worry.  My mum worries that they're going to come over and she's going to find me on the floor, dead from a heart attack. I've given both my parents keys, not only for the security door downstairs but for my front door as well, just in case.  The first doctor I saw about my weight told me I needed to take some exercise and cheer up. Then, I saw a doctor who was so concerned that she put me on this journey for gastric sleeve surgery. The way it works is the stomach is reduced by surgical removal of a large portion of the stomach.  I've tried everything. This is my last resort. Before the operation, which happened in April, I was put on a pre-op diet, partly so they could see whether I was able to lose weight. I used to drink 18 litres of cola (36 pints) over a week and a half. But I stopped drinking it completely. And I cut out sugar and put sweeteners in my tea.  I've gone on diets before but I've always put the weight back on. This time, I had support. I knew there was someone on the other end of the phone if I had any concerns. I had to prepare myself mentally for surgery. So, I joined a couple of groups on Facebook for people having bariatric surgery, all across the country.  It gave me more confidence in myself to know there are plenty more people going through it,  I'm not the one struggling by myself. I'm not the one going through this process on my own. If I need the advice, I can just do a simple post. I was in hospital for four days. It was meant to be two but I had some problems breathing after the surgery. The doctors thought one of my lungs had collapsed but it was just my body adjusting.  I was in a lot of pain when I came out but one week after the operation I was able to bend down and kneel down.  Just 10 days after the operation, I had lost 22lbs (10kg). When I left the hospital I was wearing 5XL clothes but about two months later I was able to fit into a 3XL T-shirt. That was really emotional for me. Now, it doesn't take a struggle to get out of bed. It doesn't take a struggle to go to the toilet and it doesn't take a struggle to have a shower.  I can stand there and make a cup of tea and not be in pain. Before the operation, I couldn't even do that. After the operation, post-op, is where the hard work actually began.  I haven't been active for four years, so I've had to get that movement back and build up the muscle strength again.  I feel better about myself but I still don't like the way I look. I know that will come in time and I will get my confidence back. I do feel happier within myself. The post-op diet is liquid for the first 10 days, so it's blending everything and protein shakes. After those 10 days, it's a pureed diet. Then, it's the soft diet, which is things like mashed potato and scrambled eggs. After that, you're back on a regular healthy diet.     I'm going to be on the post-op diet for the rest of my life. But as long as I can maintain that healthy diet, I can maintain my body weight.  My main aim is to get back into work and I've already started looking.  I know I've got to slow down but it's difficult not to try to do everything at once.  I'm looking to get back into football as well and I've found an area near me that has a team. Once I get the all clear, that's where I'll be going.  People think overweight people are lazy people and don't want to exercise. I just want to put it out there that people who are overweight do want to exercise. They do want to do things to change their life but sometimes it's just not physically possible. Sometimes they need a bit of help.",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-44712884,"Patients at a mental health unit have told the BBC they were pinned to the floor in agony and bullied on wards where illegal drugs were rife. Former patients at the Carseview Centre in Dundee claimed staff had used face-down restraint violently and repeatedly over the past five years. They said the practice was used for prolonged periods and patients were also mocked and shouted at by staff. NHS Tayside said it would investigate the claims in full and ""will act"".  The allegations have led to calls for the unit to be closed down. Carseview is the biggest mental health unit in Tayside, with about 80 beds over five wards. Hundreds of patients a year are treated there. The unit is already the subject of an independent inquiry into mental health services, after families of suicide victims campaigned for change. A Fatal Accident Inquiry published last week into the death of Dale Thomson said there were ""serious systemic failures in the care"" he received at Carseview. The latest allegations against Carseview centre feature in a BBC Scotland documentary, Breaking Point, which will be broadcast on Monday.  The BBC has spoken to 24 people who have been in the Carseview in the past five years. Sixteen of them said they saw that illegal drugs were available at the unit. Eleven patients said they had been unreasonably restrained face-down.  A further seven said they had seen this happening to other patients. Guidelines say face-down restraint, which can restrict a patient's breathing, should last no longer than 10 minutes and should only be used as an absolute last resort.  There have been calls for it to be banned because of the risk it can physically harm patients, as well as re-traumatise people who have been victims of violence and abuse.  Former youth worker Adele Douglas, from Forfar, was admitted to Carseview last year, after experiencing depression and anorexia. She was on 24-hour suicide watch, and, after a serious attempt to take her own life, staff pinned her to the ground.  Adele said she shouted about being in pain and one member of staff reacted badly. She said: ""At this point I was going absolutely mad, then he'd lifted his hand and slapped me really hard on my thigh.  ""When he slapped me he said, 'That's enough of that'. ""The guy was really rough with me. It was like he was taking his frustration out on me."" Adele, who is asthmatic, said she was struggling to breathe and that her knee was badly bruised by the way she was restrained. She said a nurse later told her she had been held down for 45 minutes to an hour.  She said some of the staff were very professional but that she was pinned down in this way three times during her time in Carseview. Adele was one of the 16 patients who told the BBC that drugs were available inside the unit.  Marnie Stirling, who had two stays in Carseview, with anxiety and depression, also said she saw illegal drugs on the ward ""all the time"".  ""It was rife,"" she said. ""Everyone was offered them. Cannabis was the easiest one to get."" David Fong spent a month in the unit after experiencing psychosis in 2013.  He claimed staff used restraint violently and repeatedly during his time there.  David said: ""The restraints in Carseview definitely did feel like punishments. I think it was also the nurses wanted to maintain their authority above the patients."" ""It does cause trauma,"" he added. ""Things you'll never forget."" The programme showed the testimony gathered by the BBC to two independent experts. These individuals have never worked at Carseview and are not witnesses to conditions there but they described the allegations made by the patients as abusive.  Joy Duxbury, professor of mental health at Manchester Metropolitan University, is an expert on how the rules on restraint should be carried out in practice in the wards.  She said patients should not end up with burn marks like David's if restraint was carried out properly. ""Rubbing of a face in to a carpet is certainly not an acceptable approach and would never be taught as part of prevention and management of violence and aggression,"" she said. Professor Peter Tyrer, who co-wrote the guidelines on how to handle mental health patients, said he was concerned the culture at Carseview had become so toxic it should be closed. ""I know that there are various changes going on there but I think once you get a culture like that which has been there for a long time, it's very difficult to move it,"" he said. ""What really concerns me is that if this unit persisted, it would represent a continuing scandal in mental health care."" NHS Tayside said it was very concerned by the nature of the allegations. It did not respond to the call for Carseview to be closed down. It said it could not discuss ""individual cases due to patient confidentiality"" and would not be interviewed.  The health board said it would like to include the allegations in an ongoing independent inquiry into mental health services in Tayside. Chairman John Brown said: ""We take any concerns raised with us very seriously and we want to be able to investigate people's experiences in detail and take any appropriate action. ""That is why I would encourage patients to come forward and share their own stories with us. We will listen and we will act."" Breaking Point will be broadcast on BBC One Scotland at 20:30 on Monday 9 July, and afterwards on the BBC iPlayer.",,,,

Aptamil recently changed the recipe of three of its baby milk formulas.  Hundreds of parents in the UK have complained on social media that the revised formula milk is making their babies sick. Danone said it had carried out extensive safety checks, but added that it was ""taking all feedback very seriously"".  The food giant is now investigating the complaints and has set up a free helpline that parents can call for advice. Parents in the UK are advised to call 0800 996 1000, pressing option 0 followed by option 1. There have also been complaints that the size of the revised products has been reduced from 900g to 800g a tub, but the price remains about ¬£11. Several mothers have told the BBC that their babies experienced upset stomachs after they started using the new version of Aptamil First Infant Milk powder (stage 1). The parents said they noticed that the milk powder did not dissolve in the bottles, leaving clumps of residue.  ""It smelled different, like gone-off milk that had been left out for a day,"" Rosie Menzies, from Lymington, Hampshire, told the BBC. She said that her 11-week-old son Harry would be sick soon after feeds and began to refuse bottles, until she started using a different brand.  Danone UK said: ""We would like to reassure parents that the quality and safety of our products is our number one priority.  We have recently introduced new Aptamil formulations and we recognise that some families have not found the transition to the new formula easy.    ""We have undertaken extensive quality and safety checks, including clinical trials, product testing and product experience tests on these products.  The results have shown that babies take to this formula well and that it is safe. ""We have updated the mixing instructions on our packs as this new formula requires parents to mix it up slightly differently, compared to the previous formulation - specifically, shaking vigorously for 10 seconds to dissolve the powder."" Aptamil said it had changed the recipes of three products: Aptamil First Infant Milk powder (stage 1), Aptamil Follow On Milk powder (stage 2) and Aptamil Growing Up Milk powders (stages 3 & 4).  When asked why the baby milk formula was changed, Danone did not immediately reply. Rebecca Heal in Larkfield, Kent, told the BBC that she complained to Aptamil about the new recipe and smaller packaging, and was told that the formula was changed because of ""scientific research and costs to cover that"". Ms Heal, who has a three-month-old daughter Olivia, said that she tried to follow Danone's new mixing instructions, but the milk still wasn't right. ""It took a lot of effort and shaking to get it to mix properly,"" she said. ""Even after a minute or so of vigorous shaking, the milk still had gritty residue on the sides of the bottle, but just increased the amount of froth on the top as a result."" However, some parents using the revised formula posted on Aptamil's Facebook page that they had not experienced any problems. One mother, who did not want to be named, told the BBC that her four-month-old baby had successfully transitioned from breast milk to Aptamil First Infant Milk. ""There is some residue after mixing, but then I found this was was often the case with the old formula anyway,"" she said. ""Coming from a science background, I'd rather look at things analytically, than just jumping on hysteria."" Courtney Wheeldon, based in Hull, said that her 17-week-old son Jenson, who was born prematurely, had benefited from being on the new revised formula. ""My son appears a lot more content and happy... he's putting on a lot more much-needed weight,"" she told the BBC. ""My only complaint about the new formula would be that there is 100g less in the tubs for the exact same price.""",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44723638,"Babies given solid food plus breast milk from three months sleep better than those who are solely breastfed, according to a new study.  Official advice is to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of life.  Experts say women should still heed this recommendation, although it is under review.  In the study, in JAMA Pediatrics, giving solids earlier than six months had benefits for mum and baby.  The babies slept for longer and mothers reported improved quality of life.  The study, by King's College, London, and St George's, University of London, surveyed 1,303 three-month-olds, and divided them into two groups.  One group was solely breastfed for six months, the other group was given solid foods in addition to breast milk from the age of three months.  Parents then filled in online questionnaires every month until their baby was 12 months old, and then every three months until they were three years old.  The study showed that infants in the group who ate solids as well as breast milk: Although the findings were significant, the differences between the solids group and the control group were not huge.  Babies on earlier solids slept for up to 16 minutes longer per night, potentially giving parents about two extra hours of sleep per week. Co-author of the study Dr Michael Perkin, from St George's, University of London, says small differences generated large benefits for parents. ""Given that infant sleep directly affects parental quality of life, even a small improvement can have important benefits."" More significantly, the group of babies on early solids reported half the rate of the type of sleep problems, such as crying and irritability, which make it less likely that parents are going to get back to sleep.   Bottle feeding is a woman's right, midwives told Early weaning 'may aid breastfed' Q&A: Early weaning The NHS and World Health Organization currently advise to wait until around six months before introducing solid foods, but these guidelines are currently under review.  Experts say babies should not have solid foods, at the earliest, before the end of four months. Despite the official advice, 75% of British mothers introduced solid food before five months, with a quarter (26%) citing infant night-time waking as the reason for their decision, according to the Infant Feeding Survey of 2010.   Prof Gideon Lack from King's College, London, said: ""The results of this research support the widely held parental view that early introduction of solids improves sleep.  ""While the official guidance is that starting solid foods won't make babies more likely to sleep through the night, this study suggests that this advice needs to be re-examined in light of the evidence we have gathered."" Responding to the study, Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, pointed out that guidelines for infant feeding are currently being reviewed. She said: ""These are interesting findings from a large randomised controlled trial.  ""At the RCPCH, we recommend that mothers should be supported to breastfeed their healthy-term infant exclusively for up to six months, with solid foods not introduced before four months.  ""However, the evidence base for the existing advice on exclusive breastfeeding is over 10 years old, and is currently being reviewed in the UK by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.  ""We expect to see updated recommendations on infant feeding in the not too distant future."" Source: NHS Choices What to feed babies in the first six months of life can be controversial, with many mothers feeling judged if they are unable to breastfeed successfully, and guilty if they introduce bottles or solids.  Last month, the Royal College of Midwives responded to the pressure felt by new mothers by publicly stating new guidelines for midwives to respect a woman's choice not to breastfeed.  The study on solids was part-funded by the Food Standards Agency, which was also looking at how allergies develop in babies.  An FSA spokesperson said: ""We are encouraging all women to stick to existing advice to exclusively breastfeed for around the first six months of age.  ""If there is any doubt about what's best for your baby, please seek advice from your doctor or health professional.""",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44772686,"US President Donald Trump has defended US efforts to reportedly undermine a World Health Organization (WHO) measure in support of breastfeeding. A New York Times report claimed US officials fought against language that all governments should ""protect, promote and support breastfeeding"". The report alleges that the US threatened countries over the resolution, which eventually passed. A government spokesperson called the reports ""patently false"" on Monday. On Twitter, Mr Trump ""called out"" the Times and said the ""US strongly supports breastfeeding"". According to the Times report on Sunday based on interviews with dozens of meeting participants, US negotiators in Geneva objected to the resolution encouraging breastfeeding around the world and allegedly resorted to intimidation tactics to bully other countries into dropping it. American officials allegedly sought to remove the language pushing for global government support of breastfeeding practices and attacked countries that were in favour of it. Ecuador had planned to introduce the bill, but according to the newspaper, backed out after they were threatened with punishing trade measures and the withdrawal of US military aid. Officials also reportedly threatened to cut US aid to the WHO - over $118m (¬£89m) this year, which amounts to roughly 15% of the organisation's annual budget. The resolution was passed when it was introduced by Russia, but the US did successfully strike out language calling for WHO support to nations trying to prevent ""inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children"", and added the phrase ""evidence based"" to certain provisions. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter President Trump responded in an unconventional way to a critical New York Times story about breastfeeding and US government officials. Another leader might try to tamp down the controversy, allowing his officials to handle the matter by reinforcing the benefits of mother's milk - and steering clear himself. But Mr Trump's different.  In a tweet, he says the US supports breastfeeding - but he also rips into the ""failing NY Times"", saying it should be ""called out"". This reflects his long-standing feud with the media and his well-founded belief his supporters will believe him and not ""Fake News"".  Trust in the media has eroded in recent years and, according to a Gallup Panel survey, people say more than 40% of what they see in the media is inaccurate.  This makes the newspaper an easy target for the president and lets him turn people's attention to the media - and away from the controversy over mother's milk.  WHO has long supported breastfeeding, and years of research has found breast milk to be healthier than other substitutes. Baby formula companies have for decades sold more product in developing countries than developed ones, the Times reported, suggesting the US policy was in line with companies' interests. The US State Department has refused to comment on the report. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) defended the US delegation's approach. ""The issues being debated were not about whether one supports breastfeeding,"" HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said in a statement. ""The United States was fighting to protect women's abilities to make the best choices for the nutrition of their babies.  ""Many women are not able to breastfeed for a variety of reasons, these women should not be stigmatised; they should be equally supported with information and access to alternatives for the health of themselves and their babies.""",,,,

It has accepted the advice of a new review looking at harm reported by women who received the treatment for stress urinary incontinence. The review's chair, Baroness Julia Cumberlege, said she was ""appalled at the seriousness and scale of the tragic stories"" that her team had heard.  Many women say the implants caused them agony by cutting into tissue. Some say they have been left with life-changing injuries. Claire Cooper, who had the implants, mistakenly had a hysterectomy after doctors were unable to diagnose what was causing her pain. She was left feeling suicidal and unable to have sex. It is estimated that more than 100,000 UK women have had a mesh fitted. The net-like fabric can be attached into the wall of the vagina to act as a scaffold to support organs, such as the bladder, to keep them in the right place to help manage incontinence or another condition called prolapse. Most patients suffer no ill effects, NHS England says. England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, said mesh would remain a treatment of last resort for some: ""Carefully selected patients will continue to have access in discussion with their consultant."" Baroness Cumberlege said the independent review found no evidence on the benefits for treating urinary incontinence that would outweigh ""the severity of human suffering caused by mesh complications"".  ""My team and I are in no doubt that this pause is necessary. We must stop exposing women to the risk of life-changing and life-threatening injuries. We must have measures in place to mitigate the risk, and those are sadly lacking at the moment.  ""At this stage in our review we are not recommending a ban, but a halt to procedures."" The pause can be lifted if certain checks and measures are met by March 2019, says the review team. This includes keeping a register of every procedure and any complications.  To date, it's still unclear how many women have been adversely affected by mesh. The government is carrying out an audit to try to find out.  The health watchdog NICE has already recommended that vaginal mesh operations for treating organ prolapse should largely be stopped in England.  The use of vaginal mesh to treat urinary incontinence was not mentioned in the draft NICE guidelines, however. A number of Scottish health boards have already stopped using mesh implants altogether, and in Wales the procedures are seen as a 'last resort'. The safety review chaired by Baroness Cumberlege is also looking at concerns about a hormone pregnancy test called Primodos and an epilepsy drug called sodium valproate, which have both been linked to birth defects.  Mesh used for bowel patients (rectopexy) has not been included in the temporary suspension.",,,,

They extracted a ninth boy on Tuesday, the Thai Navy said, with reports suggesting two more. If confirmed, one child and an adult remain to be rescued, bringing to a close an epic operation marred by one diver's death.   Eight boys rescued earlier are said to be in good mental and physical health. The group, a football team, had got stuck deep inside on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding. After they were found by divers last week, huddled in darkness on a ledge and cut off from the outside world for nine days, the race began to get them out before the weather deteriorated even further. The boys evacuated so far have undergone X-rays and blood tests. They will remain under observation in hospital for at least seven days. A doctor and Thai Navy Seal divers have been looking after those still on the ledge, about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave's mouth. It kicked off just after 10:00 local time (03:00 GMT) when the 19 divers made their way into the cave.  Rain was falling but rescuers say the water level inside the cave is similar to that on Sunday, the first day of the operation, an official said. Thai Navy SEALs confirmed a ninth child had been brought out at 16:06. Helicopter and ambulance activity in the cave area, from which the media have been barred, suggests that at least two more members of the Wild Boars football team were rescued and were being ferried to hospital.      By Michelle Roberts, BBC News   After the boys had spent so long in the cold and dark with poor ventilation and relatively little to eat and drink, there were concerns that they would be in a far worse state. Now that they are dry, warm and in safe care, full medical assessments can be done. None of the first eight has a fever - a sign of a possible infection - although two have needed antibiotic treatment for suspected lung infections. Doctors will be checking for any infections, such as ""caver's disease"", a lung disease caused by a fungus that grows in bat droppings. They will also make sure any cuts and scrapes that the boys have on their skin are clean and healing nicely. The boys remain in quarantine, meaning their parents will not be allowed any physical contact. This is partly to protect the boys from unnecessary infections until they regain their strength, as well as to prevent them passing on anything they might have picked up in the wet cave. They will need to build up their muscles and their immunity, as well as get used to living in the outside world again. For now, they wear shades to protect their eyes from the bright light. The first group of four boys was rescued on Sunday, followed by four more on Monday. Some of the boys had low temperatures, with one showing a low heart rate when they were first taken to hospital, but they have now recovered. ""All eight are in good health, no fever... everyone is in a good mental state,"" Jesada Chokedamrongsuk, permanent secretary of the public health ministry, said at a news conference.  Health officials say they were at first given instant food and energy gels but are now eating easy-to-digest food.  They also say some of the boys have now seen their parents - but only through glass.  Further test results are expected in a few days and if all signs of infection have cleared, families will be allowed to visit. However, they must don protective clothing and cannot go closer than 2m (6ft).  However, Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, has been allowed to visit the boys. A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - have been working in the caves. They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system.  Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers.  The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing a full-face mask, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply.  The toughest part is about halfway out at a section named ""T-Junction"", which is so tight the divers have to take off their air tanks to get through. Beyond that a cavern - called Chamber 3 - has been turned into a forward base for the divers. There the boys can rest before making the last, easier walk out to the entrance. They are then taken to hospital in Chiang Rai. In an indication of how dangerous the journey can be, a former Thai navy diver died in the caves on Friday. Saman Gunan was returning from a mission to provide the group with air tanks when he ran out of oxygen. The rescue mission chief said the second day of the operation had gone more smoothly than the first, taking two hours less as the procedure became more refined. A massive pumping operation is said to have helped lower the water level inside the cave system, making the journey in and out easier than it was. Aged between about 11 and 17 became trapped during an excursion with their coach. Some details have emerged of members of the team and their coach. Captain Duganpet Promtep, 13, is described as a motivator and highly respected by his teammates. He had apparently been scouted by several Thai professional clubs. Myanmar-born Adul Sam-on, 14, speaks several languages, and was the only team member to be able to communicate with British divers when they were first discovered. It was 17-year-old Peerapat Sompiangjai's birthday when the group became trapped in the cave.  The snacks the boys brought with them to celebrate are likely to have helped them survive their ordeal. Assistant coach Ekapol Chantawong, 25, was said to be the weakest of the group when they were found, as he had reportedly refused to eat any of the food and gave it instead to the boys.",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44777938,"A little known sexually transmitted infection could become the next superbug unless people become more vigilant, experts are warning.  Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) often has no symptoms but can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can leave some women infertile.  MG can be missed - and if it is not treated correctly, it can develop resistance to antibiotics. The British Association of Sexual Health and HIV is launching new advice.  Its draft guidelines detail how best to spot and treat MG. Mycoplasma genitalium is a bacterium that can cause inflammation of the urethra in men, causing discharge from the penis and making it painful to urinate.  In women, it can cause inflammation of the reproductive organs (womb and fallopian tubes) too, causing pain and possibly a fever and some bleeding.  You can get it by having unprotected sex with someone who has it. Condoms can prevent this spread. It was first identified in the UK in the 1980s and is thought to affect 1-2% of the general population. MG does not always cause symptoms and will not always need treatment, but it can be missed or mistaken for a different sexually transmitted infection, such as Chlamydia.  The BASHH says this is concerning.  Tests for MG have recently been developed but are not available in all clinics yet although doctors can send samples to Public Health England's laboratory to get a diagnostic result.  It can be treated with antibiotics - but the infection is developing resistance to some of these drugs.  John - not his real name - contacted the BBC to tell of his experience of having the infection. ""I was diagnosed with MG last year after meeting my new partner.  ""We both sensibly got tested and declared clean at the start of the relationship but GUM [genitourinary medicine] clinics don't test for MG, unless you have symptoms.  ""So about a month into the relationship I developed the male symptoms - a sharp burning pain while urinating and a pus-like dishcharge from my urethra - but I had no idea what was wrong.  ""After a few weeks I tested positive, while my partner was negative, which didn't make sense. She then got tested again and was positive.  ""We were put on antibiotics for two weeks but had no sexual contact for five, to make sure we were clean. After further tests we both tested negative but I still had some small amount of leakage which I was told would go away. It eventually cleared.  ""Then out of the blue I got a UTI and symptoms were exactly like MG.  ""I am now certain it has returned and I am awaiting further test results.  ""The GUM clinic refused to retest my partner as she hasn't shown any symptoms.  ""I think clinics should test for MG as part of their sexual health screening process, as this would have been picked up at the start for me."" Eradication rates of MG following treatment with one family of antibiotics, called macrolides, are decreasing globally. Macrolide resistance in the UK is estimated at about 40%, say the guidelines. One particular macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, still works in most cases however. Dr Peter Greenhouse, a sexual consultant in Bristol and BASHH member, urged people to take precautions. ""It's about time the public learned about Mycoplasma genitalium,"" he said. ""It's yet another good reason to pack the condoms for the summer holidays - and actually use them."" Paddy Horner, who co-wrote the guidelines, said: ""These new guidelines have been developed, because we can't afford to continue with the approach we have followed for the past 15 years as this will undoubtedly lead to a public health emergency with the emergence of MG as a superbug.  ""Our guidelines recommend that patients with symptoms are correctly diagnosed using an accurate MG test, treated correctly then followed up to make sure they are cured.  ""Resources are urgently needed to ensure that diagnostic and antimicrobial resistance testing is available for women with the condition who are at high risk of infertility.  ""We are asking the government directly to make this funding available to prevent a public health emergency waiting to happen and which is already spiralling out of control."" Public Health England says testing is available to diagnose MG and any signs of drug resistance, if necessary. Dr Helen Fifer, consultant microbiologist at Public Health England, welcomed the guidelines, adding: ""If you have symptoms of an STI, we recommend you get tested at your local sexual health clinic.  ""Everyone can protect themselves from STIs by consistently and correctly using condoms with new and casual partners.""",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44777939,"Experts believe they may have found a way to prevent high risk babies from developing type 1 diabetes.  The idea is to train infants' immune systems by giving them powdered insulin to offer life-long protection.  Insulin is the hormone that controls blood sugar, which goes awry in diabetes.  Pregnant women visiting maternity clinics in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Milton Keynes and Oxfordshire are being asked to sign up to the trial.  Pioneering type 1 diabetes therapy safe Parents that take part will be asked to give their children insulin powder daily  from the age of about six months until they are three years old.  They will have visits from the research team to monitor the child's health.   Half of the study participants will be given the real insulin while half will get a placebo powder containing no drug.  Neither the researchers nor participants will know which they received until after the trial so as not to bias the results.  It is thought about one in every 100 babies has genes that put them at increased risk of developing type 1, insulin-dependent diabetes.  Experts say a heel prick blood test that is routinely done on newborns to spot other conditions could also detect these genes.  The researchers, from Oxford University, want to screen 30,000 babies in this way to find eligible ones for their trial.  It is hoped that spoon-feeding insulin powder can train the immune system to tolerate the body's own insulin to prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes. Currently, there is no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. Others have been testing whether giving a different drug, called metformin, in childhood might hold off diabetes.  Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition where the pancreas does not produce insulin, causing blood glucose levels to become too high.  This can cause serious long-term health problems such as blindness, cardiovascular disease and stroke.  Chief investigator of the Oxford trial Dr Matthew Snape said: ""Preventing children and their families from having to live with diabetes and its threat of complications such as blindness, kidney or heart disease would be fantastic."" The work is being funded by the National Institute for Health Research, the type 1 diabetes charity JDRF, Diabetes UK and the Wellcome Trust, as well as the Leona M and Harry B Helmsley Charitable Trust. Dr Elizabeth Robertson, director of research at Diabetes UK, said: ""This is a huge endeavour, so we would encourage women living in the South East who think they might be eligible to find out more - research like this can't happen without the incredible people who take part.""

When the Wild Boars football team was located deep inside the cave, after being missing for a week, the Adelaide anaesthetist abandoned his holiday in Thailand and volunteered to help. He went in to assess the boys' health and stayed with them for three days.  It was under his direction that the weakest boys were first led out with the others successfully following in the complex operation.  Dr Harris, known as Harry, is believed to have been one of the last rescuers out of the cave. But relief and celebration were suddenly cut short by personal tragedy - on Wednesday it emerged that Dr Harris's father had died shortly after the rescue's finish. His employer, South Australia's ambulance service, said his family's grief had been ""magnified"" by the physical and emotional demands of the rescue operation. ""It has been a tumultuous week with highs and lows,"" Dr Andrew Pearce from MedSTAR said, asking for privacy. ""Harry is a quiet and kind man who did not think twice about offering his support on this mission."" Dr Harris was specifically identified by British divers and requested by the ""highest levels"" of the Thai government to join the rescue, according to the Australian government. ""He was an integral part of the rescue attempt,"" said Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop who added that the doctor was internationally renowned for his cave rescue expertise. ""[The Australians] have been a big help, especially the doctor,"" the leader of the rescue mission, acting Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osotanakorn told an Australian Nine News reporter on Wednesday. ""Very good. The very best,"" he said in reference to Dr Harris. His friend Sue Crowe told the BBC the doctor was an unassuming and selfless family man, whose calm presence would have comforted the boys in the cave. ""He is brilliant with children, and he would have made sure that they were prepared in the best possible way from a cave-diving perspective,"" she said. ""He would have been the perfect person to support them."" On social media, there has been an outpouring of gratitude directed towards him.  Many have called for him to be made Australian of the Year - the nation's highest civic honour - while the government has indicated there will be some formal recognition. The experienced diver, also an underwater photographer, has completed several cave-diving expeditions in Australia, New Zealand, Christmas Island and China. One tragic expedition in 2011, involved the retrieval of the body of his friend, Agnes Milowka, who ran out of air during a cave dive in South Australia. Ms Bishop said the doctor is also known to authorities for his work on medical assistance teams in natural disasters in the Pacific region, and has taken part in Australian aid missions in Vanuatu. ""[He] is an extraordinary Australian and he has certainly made a big difference to the rescue effort here in Thailand,"" she said. She also praised his diving partner, Craig Challen, a vet from Perth who accompanied Dr Harris into the caves.  The pair were part of a team of 20 Australians, including police and navy divers, who assisted in the operation.",,,,

""We had gone on an adventure activity called a tree-top walk.  ""I managed to climb up to do it - but then when it came to stepping out on to the high ropes, I just couldn't do it.  ""I felt physically ill and panicked, even though I knew I was perfectly safe."" Her phobia got worse over the next few years, to the point that it stopped her doing everyday things.  ""I went to a concert at Wembley to see Take That,"" she says. ""It's a massive venue and our seats were at the back, high up.  ""I tried to go up there to take my seat - but all of a sudden I had this feeling of utter panic.  ""It was a bit like in the cartoons when the character's eyeballs go out on strings."" Fay, now 48, started avoiding fearful situations, which, for her, included riding escalators.  ""It was the downward ones that worried me the most,"" she says. ""It wasn't so much that I was worried about tripping, I was scared of being up high and the sensation of getting pulled downwards."" Then, Fay, who works in malaria research at Oxford University, heard about a phobia therapy trial taking place in a different part of the institution.  She applied and was invited to join in. But, unfortunately, she was placed in the control group rather than the treatment one that would try out the new innovation - a virtual reality (VR) program for acrophobia (the medical term for a fear of heights).  Most of the people in the trial had been scared of heights for 30 years or more.  The ones in the treatment group - 44 in all - were given five or six 30-minute sessions of the VR treatment over the course of two weeks.  The results, which are being published by The Lancet Psychiatry, were significant. About 70% of the VR group no longer had a fear of heights, while, unsurprisingly, all of the people in the control group, who received no treatment, still did.  Fay has now had the same therapy herself.  ""Once the trial was finished, they offered it to me and I am so pleased that I said yes,"" she says.  ""Heights don't worry me now. I recently managed to get on a 30m-long [100ft] escalator at Helsinki airport and I was absolutely fine."" The VR simulator immerses people in a safe situation where they can learn to manage their fear. The user wears a VR headset and is asked to work their way up a 10-storey building and complete fear-inducing tasks, such as looking down over a high ledge and throwing balls off it. One of the hardest ones is walking out on to a platform to rescue a cat stuck in a tree or riding around the building's atrium on the nose of a giant whale called Wilber.  Lead researcher Prof Daniel Freeman said: ""We wanted tasks that would be fun and engaging and most importantly make the person look down to face their fear.  ""It had to be something that would teach them to feel safe with heights."" The therapy is also delivered by a virtual coach who reassures and guides the user along the way.  Prof Freeman said some patients might prefer this to face-to-face therapy with a clinician. Ultimately, it might also save the NHS money.  ""We need a greater number of skilled therapists, not fewer,"" he said, ""but to meet the large demand for mental health treatment, we also require powerful technological solutions.  ""We are about to start a pilot of this VR therapy with some NHS clinics. Hopefully, it will be a useful new way to help people overcome their fears."" A fear of heights is the most common phobia - one in five people has it at some point.  The study was funded by Oxford VR - a spin-out company of Oxford University - and the National Institute of Health Research Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre.",,,,

Early identification is key to tackling the sometimes fatal condition, a Welsh assembly committee said. It follows a petition by a family calling on the Welsh Government to introduce the measure after their son died aged 13. Peter Baldwin died in 2015 after his GP failed to diagnose the illness. His mother, Beth Baldwin, from Cardiff, said the recommendation made ""exceeded all expectations"", adding she was ""overwhelmed"" by the depth of the measures put forward. The committee said questions about the ""4 Ts"" symptoms -  Toilet, Thirsty, Tired and Thinner - should be routinely asked when unwell children and young people see a GP or other health professional. In addition it wants appropriate diagnostic testing, for example through the use of finger prick blood glucose testing, to be carried out immediately when symptoms which could be indicative of type 1 diabetes are present. People with type 1 diabetes cannot produce the hormone insulin, which controls the amount of glucose in the blood.  It is an unpreventable, lifelong condition and the cause is unknown but can be managed if diagnosed in time. It usually affects children or young adults, with symptoms starting suddenly and progressing quickly. About one in five of children are not diagnosed until they are in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the life-threatening state Peter Baldwin entered. Diagnosed with a chest infection by his GP, he became ill the following day and was rushed to hospital. The paramedic who attended carried out a finger prick test and diagnosed type 1 on the spot, but Peter was already too ill and died soon after. Learn more about Peter: There are about 1,400 children with diabetes in Wales, the vast majority of which (96%) have Type 1 diabetes, according to Diabetes UK Cymru.  But more needs to be done to improve awareness and recognition of the illness among the public and healthcare professionals, the committee said. ""It goes without saying that the loss of a child is, thankfully, largely unimaginable for most people and the tremendous courage of Peter's family in seeking to use such awful circumstances to prevent the same situation happening to others should command enormous respect,"" said David Rowlands AM, chairman of the petitions committee. ""They've really listened to us,"" Mrs Baldwin said. ""Wales really can lead the way on this."" The report and its recommendations will now be considered by the Welsh Government with a debate to be held during plenary in the autumn. ""A number of the committee's recommendations are already being actioned as part of our Diabetes Delivery Plan,"" a Welsh Government spokeman said. ""The plan is clear that all type 1 diabetes requires prompt diagnosis and treatment and recognises this is imperative for children. We will consider the report's findings,""",,,,

A jury in the US state of Missouri initially awarded $550m in compensation and added $4.1bn in punitive damages.  The verdict comes as the pharmaceutical giant battles some 9,000 legal cases involving its signature baby powder. J&J said it was ""deeply disappointed"" and plans to appeal. In the six-week trial, the women and their families said they developed ovarian cancer after using baby powder and other talc products for decades.  Of the 22 women represented in this case, six have died from ovarian cancer. Their lawyers alleged the company knew its talc was contaminated with asbestos since the 1970s but failed to warn consumers about the risks. Talc is a mineral and can sometimes be found in the ground in close proximity to asbestos. J&J denied that its products ever contained asbestos and insisted that they do not cause cancer.  The pharmaceutical giant added that several studies have shown its talc to be safe and said the verdict was a product of a ""fundamentally unfair process"". The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioned a study of a variety of talc samples, including J&J, from 2009 to 2010. It found no asbestos in any of them.  The prosecution lawyer told the Missouri court that the FDA and Johnson & Johnson had used flawed testing methods. Philippa Roxby, BBC health reporter There have been concerns for years that using talcum powder, particularly on the genitals, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer - but the evidence is not conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc used on the genitals as ""possibly carcinogenic"" because of the mixed evidence. The mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer, however, asbestos-free talc has been used in baby powder and other cosmetics since the 1970s. But the studies on asbestos-free talc give contradictory results.  It has been linked to a cancer risk in some studies, but there are concerns that the research may be biased as they often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago. Other studies have argued there is no link at all and there is no link between talc in contraceptives such as diaphragms and condoms (which would be close to the ovaries) and cancer.  Also there does not seem to be a ""dose-response"" for talc, unlike carcinogens like tobacco for example, where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer. The charity Ovacome says the evidence for a link is weak but even if talc does increase the risk of ovarian cancer, studies suggest it would be only by around a third. It stresses this is a small increase in risk and, because ovarian cancer is a relatively rare disease, the increase in risk is small too. Also, ovarian cancer risk is affected by many different factors - inherited and environmental ones - not just talc alone. The charity adds: ""So even if talc does increase the risk slightly, very few women who use talc will ever get ovarian cancer. Also, if someone has ovarian cancer and used talc, it seems unlikely that using talc was the reason they developed the cancer."" The verdict is the largest payout J&J has faced over the allegations.  Punitive damages are often reduced by the trial judge or on appeal, and J&J has succeeded in having several jury verdicts overturned, some of them on technical grounds.  A previous ruling in 2017 by a California jury awarded $417m (¬£323.4m) to a woman who said she developed ovarian cancer after using the firm's products, including baby powder. However, a judge later overturned that verdict and several other legal challenges by J&J are yet to be decided. The majority of the 22 women were from outside the state of Missouri. The presentation of their combined cases at such a court is known as forum shopping. This will be one of the elements challenged by Johnson & Johnson at appeal.  Johnson & Johnson said: ""Every verdict against Johnson & Johnson in this court that has gone through the appeals process has been reversed and the multiple errors present in this trial were worse than those in the prior trials which have been reversed.""",,,,

Several boys can be seen in facemasks and hospital gowns, at least one giving a peace sign for the camera. Meanwhile, reports say the boys and the coach were sedated to stop them panicking during the dangerous rescue. The Thai Navy Seals also released new video showing the three-day rescue operation that captivated the world. Divers who took part in the operation said the boys were heavily sedated to avoid anxiety as they went through the dark, narrow, underwater passageways. Former Navy seal Chaiyananta Peeranarong told AFP news agency: ""Some of them were asleep, and some of them were wiggling their fingers, kind of groggy - but they were breathing. My job was to transfer them along."" Each boy was strapped to one of two rescue divers tasked with shepherding him, and bundled onto stretchers to be carried through the dry parts. Earlier on Wednesday, the head of the Thai Navy Seals told the BBC that ""hope became reality"" with the rescue of the boys and their coach from the Tham Luang cave. ""We had a little bit of hope that they might still be alive but we had to do it, we just had to move forward,"" Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew said. ""There was only a tiny bit of hope, but that's all we had to work with."" The group was trapped in the cave by rising water and rescued in a dramatic operation that captivated the world.  The complex, three-day rescue saw four boys emerge on Sunday, four on Monday, and the final four boys plus their coach on Tuesday. They survived the nine days before they were found by drinking water dripping from the cave walls, officials said. The boys lost on average 2kg (4.4lb) during their ordeal but are said to be in good physical condition. They will remain in hospital in the nearby city of Chiang Rai for a week, followed by a week's recuperation at home. The first four boys have already been visited by their families, officials said, and the others will be allowed to receive visitors soon. There were cheers around the cave as the dozens of divers and hundreds of other rescue workers involved in the operation left the site. In Chiang Rai, the news was greeted by the honking of car horns while people gathered outside the hospital broke into applause. On social media, Thais showed their feelings about the rescuers by using hashtags including #Heroes and #Thankyou. Offers of hospitality for the boys, the coach and their rescuers have come in from international football clubs including Manchester United and Benfica. Aged between about 11 and 17, the members of the Wild Boars football team entered the cave system in dry weather, during an excursion with their coach. The group was cut off on 23 June after heavy rains flooded the cave complex. They were huddled in darkness on a ledge when they were found by British divers. Elation at the discovery of the group quickly turned to concern as it became clear how difficult it would be to rescue boys who could not swim and had been weakened by their time underground. Getting to and from the chamber where the group were trapped was an exhausting round trip even for experienced divers. The process involved a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes. The boys and their coach were trapped underground for a total of 17 days.  They reportedly entered the cave to celebrate one of the team's birthday, and the snacks they brought with them are thought to have helped sustain them. Once found, they were given ""easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor"", said Rear Adm Arpakorn Yuukongkaew. Authorities said they seemed to cope well with the mental strain of their time underground. Rescue teams brought them lights and letters from their parents to help them cope.

His body was preserved in the ice for millennia until it was discovered in 1991. Scientists have been able to find out about many aspects of his life, including what he ate before he died. They say he filled his stomach with fat from wild goat, meat from red deer, an ancient grain known as einkorn and toxic fern. The fat content was 50%, which is much higher than the 10% in the average modern diet.  ""If you consider the altitude where the Iceman was hunting, you need this kind of energy supply,"" said Dr Frank Maixner of the Eurac Research Institute for Mummy Studies in Bolzano, Italy.  ""And the best way to do this is by eating fat; this gives you the necessary energy to survive in this harsh environment."" The study, published in Current Biology, gives a rare glimpse into what was on the menu during the Copper Age. The Iceman's diet has been analysed before, but not in such detail. The latest investigation is based on looking at his stomach contents. Surprisingly, this organ was discovered only recently as it was not in the normal place, due to the way his body was mummified over time. The scientists were able to deduce that the fat came not from dairy products, but from the Alpine ibex, a species of wild goat that lives in the mountains of the European Alps.  ""His diet was a well-balanced mix of carbohydrates, proteins and also fat,"" said Dr Maixner. ""Quite astonishing also was the high fat content he ingested.""  The meal would have sustained Oetzi on his snowy trek, but it may not have tasted too good. ""It's goat fat and it's hard to imagine how this tastes,"" said Dr Maixner. ""It's definitely not as tasty as we would eat nowadays. ""Considering that there was no salt also, the pure taste of this meat, this fat - of all these components - I think it's hardly edible."" Although the Iceman did not have to contend with processed food, there was a negative side to his diet.  He already had signs of blocked arteries at the time of his death. He may have died in battle, as he had several wounds to his body and was carrying weapons, including a copper axe. He may also have been dosing himself with herbal medicine, as the researchers found traces of bracken, a type of fern, in his stomach.  Alternatively, he may have wrapped his food up in fern leaves and ingested the toxic spores by mistake. The wild meat may have been eaten fresh or perhaps dried.   Follow Helen on Twitter.",,,,

Teachers kept telling him he was lazy and he kept missing the football during games.  Then, aged 12, his mother took him to have his eyes tested and that changed everything.  Now he is a prize-winning eye doctor with a plan to use a smartphone app to bring better vision to millions of children around the world.  Dr Bastawrous told the BBC: ""I'll never forget that moment at the optometrist. I had trial lenses on and looked across the car park and saw the gravel on the road had so much detail I had had no idea about.  ""A couple of weeks later I got my first pair of glasses and that's when I saw stars for first time, started doing well at school and it completely transformed my life."" Around the world 12 million children, like Dr Bastawrous, have sight problems that could be corrected by a pair of glasses. But in many areas, access to eye specialists is difficult - leaving children with visual impairments that can harm school work and, ultimately, their opportunities in later life. In rural Kenya, for example, there is one eye doctor for one million people. Meanwhile in the US, there is on average one ophthalmologist for every 15,800 people.  In 2011 Dr Bastawrous - by now an eye doctor in England - decided to study the eye health of the population of Kitale, Kenya, as part of his PhD.  He took about ¬£100,000 of eye equipment in an attempt to set up 100 temporary eye clinics but found this didn't work, as reliable roads and electricity were scarce.  It was realising that these same areas had great mobile phone coverage - with about 80% of the population owning a cell phone - that sparked the idea for Peek.  Peek is a smartphone-based system that can bring eye care to people wherever they are.  One part of the Peek system works in a similar way to an optician's eye chart, checking how well a person can see.  Dr Bastawrous wanted to see if Peek could be used by non-specialists in areas where eye specialists are scarce. His team came up with the idea of training teachers - turning the teacher into an optician.  Now a trial published in the Lancet Global Health shows Peek can be used successfully to bring pocket eye tests to schools, helping more children to get the glasses they need.  Dr Bastawrous - together with a team of researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - spent a week training 25 teachers in 50 schools in rural Kenya to use their Peek system or standard eye tests normally done by specialist nurses.  Half of the primary school children were then tested using the Peek system and half with standard eye tests using a series of paper testing cards. After their tests, children who were examined by the Peek system were shown a split-screen simulation of how blurred their sight was compared with someone who could see clearly.  Crucially, they were then given a printout of this to pass on to their parents, showing them just how poor their child's sight was. The Peek system also sent out details of the nearest eye clinic along with text-message reminders to encourage parents to take their children to hospital.  Meanwhile, the children who took the paper-based vision test had their scores recorded manually and, if the teachers detected any eye problems, were given a paper letter to pass on to their parents.  Researchers found twice as many children attended hospital for free eye checks with Peek than went for standard eye tests.  Dr Hillary Rono, an eye doctor based in Kenya and lead researcher on the study, said:  ""This could be a world changer. To put it in perspective, I am one of the 100 ophthalmologists in Kenya.  ""I am in charge of a region that has two million people. I cannot reach everybody in that area.  ""Therefore, this technology will allow people without medical skills to identify the children with problems and link them with doctors like me so they can treat them."" The study also found the app picked up on more children with eye problems than the standard tests - although, some were allergic conditions that temporarily blurred vision rather than sight problems that needed glasses.   Researchers realised these children benefited from treatment too so Peek has now been refined to spot the difference between eyesight issues and other eye problems, and send children to the right place for help. Commenting on the study, Peter Holland, of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, said: ""Innovations like Peek bring the costs of screening and referrals down and put services within reach of millions who are currently being left behind.  ""They have the potential to offer the promise of sight to many who need it."" Peek is being rolled out across more schools in Kenya, serving 300,000 children, with subsidised glasses for those who need them.  The government of Botswana is planning on using it nationwide and it is also being used in India. Follow Smitha on Twitter.",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44823286,"Although many of us are enjoying the balmy temperatures of this year's heatwave, unfortunately for some, biting insects are flourishing too.  Calls to the NHS helpline 111 about insect bites are almost double the rate they normally are at this time of year. And senior doctors are reporting incidents of patients being treated in hospital for infected horsefly bites.  Despite the heat, experts say standing water, such as garden paddling pools, where insects thrive should be removed. Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: ""We wouldn't normally see anyone coming to hospital for a bite, but we have seen a few recently needing treatment with antibiotics which is very unusual.  ""A couple of these were infected bites from horseflies. They actually give one of the nastier bites, because they take a chunk out of you.  ""They can be very painful, and can take a while to heal, and as result can get infected and need antibiotics. In the worst-case scenario, they can cause cellulitis, an infection of the skin.""  According to Public Health England data on calls to NHS 111, about 9,000 people called the helpline on 8 July, around double the baseline figure which is constructed from historical data. This chimes with the Met Office records of the heatwave. Although most of June and July was warm, temperatures peaked between 24 June and 9 July when 28 degrees was recorded somewhere in the UK every day. This happens on average only twice a decade.   Prof Adam Hart, an entomologist at Gloucestershire University, said that anecdotally horseflies were on the rise, although there is no hard data to confirm this.  ""We had a wet spring, then we've got this beautiful hot weather which are great conditions for a lot of different insects to thrive in."" Dr Daniel Whitmore of the Natural History Museum's insect division agrees: ""Horseflies like hot weather in general, so they may become more active around breeding sites and farms in hot weather. ""Obviously, by wearing fewer clothes in hot weather we expose ourselves to bites more and become more attractive to the flies.  ""From personal experience I've noticed that the likelihood of being bitten increases after a dip in the pool (or stream or river): the wet skin probably helps the flies detect us."" But whereas most bites are relatively painless and clear up quickly on their own, the horsefly bite is noticeably more painful and more likely to get infected.  'Rise' in cleg bites amid warm weather  Horsefly season: how to avoid being bitten Creating a 'pain index' for insect bites  Natalie Bungay, from the British Pest Control Association (BPCA) is advising the public to be pest aware.  ""Horsefly bites are particularly painful because their main food source is livestock, which have a limited ability to move the fly away. ""This means they can take their food without having to worry about delivering a painful bite, as the animals are generally powerless to stop them.  ""This is as opposed to mosquitoes, which extract blood through a painless bite."" As horseflies and mosquitoes rely on wet and marshy areas to breed, the BPCA is advising the public to remove standing water from near their homes, where possible. If bitten, Dr Scriven advises paracetamol and calamine lotion to reduce itching.   After a horsefly bite, the advice is to seek medical attention if the skin starts to get red and you develop a fever. Follow Laurel Ives on Twitter",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-44838622,"Potentially toxic algae is blooming in rivers and lochs during Scotland's long, hot summer, scientists have warned.  Blue-green algae, which poses a health risk to humans and animals, has flourished during the warm spell.  The algae has reportedly led to the death of two dogs after they ingested the substance earlier this summer.  Now scientists are urging people to record sightings of the algae in a bid to speed up response times.  Freshwater ecologist Prof Laurence Carvalho said blue-green algae had been a particular problem this summer.  ""Not only has it been very warm but it has also been very dry, which means they have not been flushed out of water courses by rain,"" he said.  It is posing a particular risk to dogs who appear to be attracted by the smell, he added.   Earlier this month a dog reportedly died from algae poisoning after drinking water from the River Conon, near Maryburgh in the Highlands.  A similar incident is reported to have happened in Loch Awe in May.  Prof Carvalho said: ""Animals will drink from water if they are thirsty and it seems dogs are particularly affected because they seem to be attracted by the smell of the algae."" Blue-green algae are microscopic, but clump together in visible colonies up to a few millimetres in size that can rise to the surface and form thin wispy green blooms or thick, paint-like scums. When it is ingested, it can cause damage to the liver or the nervous system in humans and animals.  People who have been swimming in or have swallowed algal scum can suffer from skin rashes, eye irritation, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever and muscle and joint pain but there is no evidence of long-term effects or death among people in the UK.  Prof Carvalho, who works at the Centre for Ecoology and Hydrology, has helped develop an app called Bloomin' Algae which allows users to submit images of the bloom and its location. The information will be passed on to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, so it can inform local authorities.  He said: ""The app provides an early warning system and speeds up the process of local authorities or landowners putting up signs at sites where there is blue-green algae, to warn the public of the risks.  ""It will also help us understand the drivers of growth of these algae, such as the impact of climate change.""",,,,

An inquiry into the ethical issues surrounding genetically altering a human embryo has found there is ""no absolute reason not to pursue it"". But appropriate measures must be put in place before it becomes UK law, said the report - which calls for further research both medically and socially. Inquiry chair, Prof Karen Yeung, said: ""The implications for society are extensive, profound and long-term."" The use of genome editing in embryos for assisted reproduction in humans is currently prohibited by UK law, but is permitted in some research. Scientists can do gene editing on discarded IVF embryos, as long as they are destroyed immediately afterwards, for example. Heritable genome editing could be used to wipe out genetic diseases in certain families by deleting or permanently changing any troublesome code in embryos, or the sperm and egg.  But the field is attracting controversy over concerns it is opening the door to designer babies.  Commenting on the Nuffield Council of Bioethics' review of genome editing, Dr David King, Director of Human Genetics Alert, said: ""This is an absolute disgrace. We have had international bans on eugenic genetic engineering for 30 years. But this group of scientists thinks it knows better, even though there is absolutely no medical benefit to this whatever. The Nuffield Council doesn't even bother to say no to outright designer babies.  The people of Britain decided 15 years ago that they don't want GM food. Do you suppose they want GM babies?"" The independent inquiry by the Nuffield Council concludes that any invention should be guided by two key principles:  The Council stated that the use of heritable genome editing ""should not increase disadvantage, discrimination or division in society"". Sally Philips: A World Without Down's Syndrome First gene editing in human body attempt Director of the Nuffield Council Hugh Whittall said consideration needed to be given to groups whose conditions might be ""edited out"" of the population by the removal of a genetic variant. The Council have called for a broad and inclusive societal debate, with as many voices as possible heard. CRISPR, a biological system for altering DNA, was discovered in 2012. It can be used by scientists to make precise changes to DNA. CRISPR scans the genome looking for the right location and then uses the Cas9 protein as molecular scissors to snip through the DNA. Scientists have been using it in the lab to target and cut out faulty DNA in human cells that cause illnesses.  While effective, the process is less than perfect and can cut out too much DNA, experts have found. These unwanted or 'off-target' edits could, theoretically, alter other important genes - inadvertently triggering cancer, for example. In the near future, it might be possible to correct the DNA of embryos carrying the gene for Huntington's disease or cystic fibrosis. But arguably, the most controversial aspect of gene editing concerns the potential to introduce changes to the germline - DNA alterations that would pass down the generations.  The Council also recommended further research to be carried out ""to establish standards of clinical safety"". A recent study by scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, suggests the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can cause greater genetic damage in cells than previously thought, and advised gene therapy scientists to proceed ""with caution"". Speaking to reporters on Monday, members of the Nuffield Council working group were clear that the science still had ""some way to go"" and said it could be up to 20 years before heritable genome editing becomes a feasible option. ""It is important to stress that there is still great uncertainty over what genome editing may be able to achieve,"" said Prof Yeung, Professor of Law, Ethics and Informatics at the University of Birmingham. Even once legalised, the Council have recommended genome editing should only be licensed on a case-by-case basis and under strict regulation and monitoring. ""No change will happen overnight,"" said Mr Whittall ""This report is not a full stop. It plays into an ongoing - and international - discussion.""",,,,

The consumer group Which? tested 11 of the most popular products on the market and found eight of them had above the recommended levels of boron. The chemical is found in borax, a common ingredient in slime that helps to create its stickiness. Exposure to excessive levels of boron can cause irritation, diarrhoea, vomiting and cramps. Which? has passed its findings on to the Office for Product Safety and Standards. It said there needed to be better regulation of the market, as many slimes had minimal safety labelling or information on ingredients. Which? director of research Nikki Stopford said: ""If you have school-age kids, you're probably very well aware of the latest slime craze sweeping the playgrounds. Kids love it. ""Parents buying slime for their children should have peace of mind that these toys are safe, so they will be shocked to find that the health of their children could be put at risk by these slimes. ""There must be fundamental changes to the product safety system. ""Manufacturers must stop making unsafe products and the government and retailers simply have to do a far better job of getting anything identified as a risk off the shelves and out of people's homes"". The products found with above the recommended 300mg/kg level of boron were: All of them were sold by Amazon. The company told Which? it had removed the products that had failed the tests from sale. Amazon was unable to provide a comment to the BBC. Which? said people who had bought the products should be entitled to a refund and should stop using the product.

But can repetitive heading cause damage to the brain and lead to long-term health problems? A new study of 300 former professional players aims to answer the question. The plan is to put the ex-players, aged between 50 and 85, through a series of tests designed to assess their physical and cognitive capabilities.  There will be clinical examinations and data will be gathered on the players' career in the game and lifestyle factors.   This will allow comparisons between defenders and centre forwards and other players who tend to head the ball less often. The study will be carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical  Medicine (LSHTM), Queen Mary University of London and the Institute of Occupational Medicine.  The test results will be compared with those from a general population study known as the 1946 Birth Cohort which has monitored the ageing process in a group born in that year. Jeff Astle's daughter: Dad's job killed him 'Urgent need' for football header research Football headers 'linked to brain damage' The new study will be similar to one which the Rugby Football Union embarked on in 2016 to assess the long-term impact of concussions experienced by former players in England.  Both are funded by the Drake Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation focusing on research on concussion injuries in sport. Lead researcher Prof Neil Pearce, from LSHTM, said: ""We know that there are increased risks of neurological disorders from head injury in sports such as boxing. However, we don't know much about the risks from concussion in football, and we know almost nothing about the long-term effects from heading the ball repeatedly. ""This study will provide, for the first time, persuasive evidence of the long-term effects on cognitive function from professional football."" News of the latest study follows increasing debate about the link between repetitive heading and concussion injuries and brain diseases such as dementia and Parkinson's. In February 2017, researchers from University College London and Cardiff University published a study based on post-mortem examinations of the brains of six former players which found signs of brain injury in four cases.   Last year, former England player and BBC pundit Alan Shearer fronted a BBC documentary on the subject.   He highlighted the case of Jeff Astle who played for West Brom and England and developed dementia before dying at the age of 59 in 2002. A coroner ruled that Mr Astle's brain had been damaged by years of heading a football.  Alan Shearer concluded that ""very little has been done to investigate the effects of heading a ball. I find that staggering."" In November 2017, the Football Association and Professional Footballers' Association announced they were funding a study run by the University of Glasgow and the Hampden Sports Clinic looking at physical and mental health outcomes in former players, based on analysis of medical records.  The team, headed by neuropathologist Dr Willie Stewart, will address the question: ""Is the incidence of degenerative neuro-cognitive disease more common in ex-professional footballers than in the normal population?"" The new research is understood to be the first of its kind in the UK to involve interviews and tests on former players.  James Drake, chairman of the Drake Foundation, said: ""Many people have waited many years for a study like this - the Drake Foundation is proud to be funding this work and to be a part of this important step forwards in our understanding of sports-related concussion and its long-term effects."" Gordon Taylor, of the Professional Footballers' Association, welcomed the announcement: ""For the last two decades the issue of head impacts, head injuries, concussions and neurodegenerative disease in former players has been of much concern to all at the PFA and our duty of care to our members.""",,,,

But it comes with a twist: the health claims in the video are revealed as completely false.  Jonathan Jarry, its creator, is a science communicator whose career focuses on debunking misinformation like the claims found in his viral video.  The video on the value of scepticism has racked up over nine million views.  Mr Jarry, with McGill University's Office for Science and Society (OSS) in Montreal, said he was inspired to make the video when a former co-worker sent him a Facebook post that claimed cancer could be cured by radio waves.  It was ""rife with inaccuracies and omissions"" and had been viewed online a whopping six million times, he said. Evidence-based efforts by OSS,  a venture dedicated to promoting critical thinking and the presentation of scientific information to the public, to debunk claims like the radio waves cancer cure theory get barely a fraction of those numbers.  ""My idea was let's see if we can build a sort of a Trojan horse,"" Mr Jarry told the BBC.  ""And make a video that looks on the outside superficially like one of these easily shareable videos.""  He set about cobbling together a video with claims of an ""amazing cancer cure"" discovered by a Dr Johan R Tarjany in the 1800s that has long been suppressed by the pharmaceutical industry - a unique moss that can alter cancer's DNA.  With upbeat music, savvy editing and claims that sound like they have some scientific basis, he mimicked many viral health videos currently spreading misinformation online.  But halfway through Mr Jarry's video comes the big reveal: there is no Dr Johan R Tarjany and no cancer-curing moss.  It goes on to warn the viewer about how easy it is to get roped into false claims.  ""The point is, be sceptical. Ask questions,"" it warns.  Health misinformation is a serious concern for public health agencies worldwide.  In April, Cancer Research UK warned that belief in fake causes of cancer is rife among the public.  In the US, the Food and Drug Administration offers online guides to protect consumers from products claiming to cure cancer online and on social media.  Mr Jarry sees many of the health hoax videos like the one he parodied online and ""they spread like wildfire."" ""We do have to learn to recognise these bad arguments for what they are,"" he said.  ""They're an appeal to our emotions, to our superficial level of thinking, but they are empty on the inside.""

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44845879,"Taking omega-3 fish oil supplements is often touted as a simple way to protect your heart - but experts say the evidence that it does any good is flimsy at best.  Cochrane researchers looked at trials in over 100,000 people and found little proof that it prevented heart disease.  They say the chance of getting any meaningful benefit from taking omega-3 is one in 1,000.  Eating oily fish, however, can still be recommended as part of a healthy diet.  The review mainly looked at supplements rather than omega-3 from eating fish. Experts still believe the latter is good for the heart as well as general health. The NHS says people should try to eat two portions of fish per week, one of which should be oily fish, such as salmon, fresh tuna or mackerel, to get enough ""good"" fats. Omega-3 is a family of fats that includes:  Some brands of milk, yoghurt, bread and spreads have extra omega-3 (usually ALA) added to them.  But when it comes to fish oil supplements, Cochrane lead author, Dr Lee Hooper, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""We can be confident in the findings of this review which go against the popular belief that long-chain omega-3 supplements protect the heart.  ""This large systematic review included information from many thousands of people over long periods.  ""Despite all this information, we don't see protective effects.  ""The review provides good evidence that taking long-chain omega-3 [fish oil, EPA or DHA] supplements does not benefit heart health or reduce our risk of stroke or death from any cause.  ""The most trustworthy studies consistently showed little or no effect of long-chain omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health."" Some fish contain small amounts of chemicals that may be harmful if eaten in large amounts. Shark, marlin and swordfish may contain small amounts of mercury and should be avoided by women who are pregnant or planning a baby and by all children under 16.  Other groups should eat no more than one portion of these fish each week.  Prof Tom Sanders, a nutrition expert at King's College London and honorary director of Heart UK, said: ""Current dietary guidelines to prevent cardiovascular disease encourage fish consumption, rather than taking supplements.  ""This study provides no evidence to suggest that this dietary advice should change."" Prof Tim Chico, a cardiologist from Sheffield University, said: ""There was a period where people who had suffered a heart attack were prescribed these on the NHS. This stopped some years ago.   ""Such supplements come with a significant cost, so my advice to anyone buying them in the hope that they reduce the risk of heart disease, I'd advise them to spend their money on vegetables instead."" Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the Health and Food Supplements Information Service, said early studies of omega-3 fats had found a protective benefit for the heart, but it wasn't always easy to pick up the modest effects of dietary change, particularly in older people on medication. ""For those who won't eat mackerel, salmon or herring, a daily fish oil supplement is a useful way of meeting recommendations,"" she said. ""Omega-3s are also used by the body to maintain the health of the eyes, immune function and brain so it's not all about the heart.""",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44859777,"A major study has cast doubt on a routine treatment for cardiac arrest patients that is used when others fail. A trial of 8,000 patients found that adrenaline injections slightly increased the chances of survival compared to those given a dummy treatment (placebo). However, a greater proportion of patients given adrenaline survived with brain damage. Policymakers said they would look at the study's findings in detail. A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body. Treating the condition quickly with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation offers the best chances of survival. When these fail, current guidance recommends injections of adrenaline in order to try to restore a heartbeat - a practice that has been in place for nearly 60 years.  But increasingly there has been evidence to suggest the treatment may result in worse long-term survival rates and greater brain damage in patients, researchers said. For this new trial, cardiac arrest patients from England and Wales were given either an injection of adrenaline or a saltwater solution (a dummy treatment) by paramedics, who did not know which they were giving. The three-year study found that of the 4,012 patients given adrenaline, 130 (3.2%) were alive 30 days after treatment compared with 94 (2.4%) of the 3,995 patients who had been given the saltwater solution.  However, in the adrenaline group 39 of those who went on to be discharged from hospital had severe brain damage compared with 16 who had received a placebo.  This meant that 87 people from the adrenaline group (2.2%) survived with a ""favourable neurological outcome"" (defined as anything from a moderate disability to no disability at all) compared to 74 (1.9%) in the placebo group - a difference researchers said was not statistically significant.    Prof Gavin Perkins, one of the paper's authors, from Warwick Medical School, at the University of Warwick, said: ""Patients may be less willing to accept burdensome treatments if the chances of recovery are small or the risk of survival with severe brain damage is high.  ""The findings of this trial will require careful consideration by the wider community and those responsible for clinical practice guidelines for cardiac arrest."" Authors of the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, said it was not yet fully understood why those who received adrenaline had more brain damage.  One of their theories is that although adrenaline increases blood flow in large blood vessels, it impairs it in very small vessels, which may worsen brain damage caused by a cardiac arrest.  Alternatively, it may be the case that adrenaline led to more people with severe brain damage surviving.  Dr David Nunan, senior researcher at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, said the ""landmark trial"" would change the way people are treated. But Prof Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University, said deciding whether to change the guidelines would not be an easy decision to make.  ""Is it worth being treated with adrenaline if it slightly increases one's chances of surviving, even if one might only survive in a state of considerable disability? I think that's a bit difficult to say, overall.""   Researchers acknowledged their study raised ""significant ethical issues"". In February, the family of a woman who died from a cardiac arrest, Trudy Jones, from Wrexham, said they only found out she had been involved in the study at the inquest into her death.  Researchers said the urgency of cardiac arrest treatment meant it had been impossible to seek the consent of patients to take part in the trial before they had been treated, as would usually be the case. Instead, families were contacted afterwards for consent if the patient survived. The researchers, who gained ethical approval for the study, added that a public awareness campaign about the trial had run before it had started, offering people the chance to opt out.  The Resuscitation Council, which helps write the guidelines for resuscitation used by health professionals, said it would look at the study in detail, as it expected it to inform future UK guidelines.

Well-known figures such as Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande have helped silver locks soar in popularity. Renowned hair colourist Rita Hazan has worked with celebrities such as Beyonc√© and Mariah Carey. Salons like hers have seen a surge in requests for silver and platinum colours in recent years, as well as other soft pastel shades like pink. She urges against at-home dyeing to recreate the trend, reminding people that celebrities have a ""whole production"" of professionals, wigs and extensions behind the amazing hair that people see on social media or on the red carpet. ""People are torturing their hair to get the look - a lot of it is fantasy that people are looking at,"" she says. It was the silver trend that convinced 30-year-old Stephanie Tunchez from Texas to stop dying her natural hair two-and-a-half years ago.  ""I thought to myself: 'Wow! They're paying hundreds of dollars in the salon to achieve this look and I'm over here trying to cover it up."" Her transformation inspired her mum to do the same: ""Now we are hair twins and I love it."" Rachael Gibson, known as the Hair Historian on social media, points out that while celebrity hair trends are nothing new, our recent ""obsession"" with looking young is. Historically, and still in some places, grey hair was viewed as a symbol of wisdom and knowledge. Throughout the 18th century powdering elaborate wigs and your hair off-white became all the rage for the European elite.  Rudimental hair colorants have been used since ancient Egyptian and Roman cultures (pickled leeches or urine hair baths, anyone?) but only emerged in their modern form around the turn of the 20th Century. ""It typically wasn't seen as something that a 'respectable' woman would do. It conjured up an idea of vanity and indulgence in beauty,"" Rachael says.  Just as the image of the ""perfect housewife"" was proliferated in 1950s pop culture, brands such as L'Or√©al and Clairol began marketing safe and discreet at-home colours.  Commercial dyes were marketed squarely at women who wanted to remain fertile and youthful in their appearance. Within a couple of decades male-oriented brands would do the same. ""Baby boomer generations have chosen not to grow old in the same way that their parents did,"" Rachael says. ""These days being in your 50s and 60s doesn't mean being an old person in the same way it used to.""  Most of what we consider 'premature' greying actually isn't - a testament to how well women have hidden the reality in recent decades.   Prof Desmond Tobin, a hair and skin pigmentation specialist at the University of Bradford in the UK, explains that it is perfectly normal for people from European backgrounds to start greying in their early 20s.  He collaborated on a study which pinpointed genes responsible for various hair traits, including greying. The research found that different races have different average aging rates - with African and East-Asian backgrounds tending to whiten later. Research has shown that our hair follicle production can be influenced by factors such as hormones and stress, but some people have a genetic predisposition to lose pigment or go bald more than others.  While men with shorter hair can transition to silver with the salt-and-pepper grace of George Clooney, the process can mean years of stress for some women.  Martha says she started the Grombre Instagram account to help herself and others on those ""difficult days"" of doubting the process. Shelli Gillis, 46, believes that wider changes in the media have the potential to enable women to feel more confident in going grey. ""I think we'll see more women embracing it, as they see role models or see inspiration on how beautiful it can be on the other side,"" she says. ""That's what I say to people: I know the transition can be a rough road, but the destination seems really worth it to me.""  You may also like:",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44884601,"Cancer patients who use alternative therapies may be more likely to shun conventional treatments and risk their chances of survival, research suggests. A study of 1,290 patients in the US found people who received such therapies often refused life-saving care such as chemotherapy or surgery. Fewer of them survived five years after starting treatment compared to those on standard care, researchers found. Experts urged patients not to ditch proven cancer medicines. Researchers said the use of alternative therapies, which include certain diets, minerals and vitamin infusions, was growing in the US but there was limited research on how effective they are.  Their study, published in JAMA Oncology, looked at 258 patients who had used these therapies with at least one standard treatment, compared to 1,032 who only received conventional care. The study found a smaller proportion of those who received such treatment had survived five years after beginning treatment - 82.2% compared to 86.6%. Separately, they were found to be more than twice as likely to die at any point over the course of the nine-year study, as a result of either refusing or delaying standard treatment. Comparing people who received alternative therapies with those who did not, the report found: The paper's authors said it was likely the results for those who used alternative therapies would have been worse were it not for the fact that they were a group that had better cancer survival chances to begin with. As a group, they were more likely to be women, younger, more affluent and healthier, the study's authors noted. Although researchers linked the lower chances of survival to refusing or delaying standard treatments, lead author Dr Skyler Johnson, from Yale School of Medicine, told the BBC it was also possible some alternative therapies could interact with conventional treatments and make them less effective. The study did not include data on the exact therapies people used.  But Dr Johnson said they were more likely to be alternative medicines - treatments that lack clear scientific evidence and are often used in place of conventional care - rather than complementary therapies like yoga or massage, which are usually used alongside standard treatments. ""The reality is despite the fact that many patients believe that these types of unproven therapies will improve their survival and possibly even improve their chances of a cure, there's really no evidence to support that claim..."" said Dr Johnson.  ""Although they may be used to support patients experiencing symptoms from cancer treatment, it looks as though they are either being marketed or understood to be effective cancer treatments."" Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK's head information nurse, said complementary medicine might help improve wellbeing or quality of life for some patients.  ""But it is important that patients considering them do not see them as an alternative to conventional treatments that have been shown though clinical trials to make a real difference to survival,"" he said.  Prof Arnie Purushotham, director at King's Health Partners Comprehensive Cancer Centre, said there was a clear difference between alternative therapies and complementary treatments. ""The medical community is united in agreeing that alternate therapy is not an effective means of treating cancer patients.  ""However, there is increasing evidence that complementary therapy like acupuncture, yoga and relaxation therapy may be beneficial in alleviating cancer patients' symptoms like pain and fatigue.""

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44884593,"A ""dangerous complacency"" in the response to the global HIV pandemic is risking a resurgence of the disease, according to a report.  Experts said a stalling of HIV funding in recent years was endangering efforts to control the illness. As things stand, the world is no longer on course to end the pandemic by 2030 - a target agreed by UN member states, say experts in The Lancet.  They call for urgent changes in how the disease is treated and controlled. About 37 million people worldwide live with HIV or Aids. And there are an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year. New cases of HIV/Aids have been falling in recent years. But the Lancet Commission said the fall was happening too slowly to reach the UNAids target of 500,000 new infections by 2020. While HIV rates were falling overall, they remained persistent in marginalised groups, younger people - particularly women - and in developing countries, all of whom were less likely to access treatment, the commission said.  Experts said HIV funding had remained flat in recent years, at about ¬£14.7bn - roughly ¬£5.4bn short of the estimated amount needed to achieve the UNAids targets.  Dr Linda-Gail Bekker, president of the International Aids Society and professor at University of Cape Town, South Africa, said: ""Despite the remarkable progress of the HIV response, the situation has stagnated in the past decade.  ""Reinvigorating this work will be demanding - but the future health and wellbeing of millions of people require that we meet this challenge."" The Lancet Commission also called for more collaboration between health professionals and for HIV treatment to become better incorporated into other areas of healthcare.  This would mean an end to HIV ""exceptionalism"", where specific funding and services have been provided for HIV alone, and could include combining HIV screening with screening for other non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. In India, for example, if HIV testing and treatments were combined with those for syphilis among women sex workers and gay men it could reduce the number of new HIV cases at a national-level by 7% between 2018 and 2028, the report estimated.  ""Health systems must be designed to meet the needs of the people they serve, including having the capacity to address multiple health problems simultaneously,"" Prof Chris Beyrer said.

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44797545,"The widespread use of opioids to treat pain frequently prompts concerns about addiction and even deaths. So, why are these sometimes dangerous drugs still being given to patients? Much stronger than many of the other options, opioids are among the world's most commonly prescribed painkillers. These drugs - including morphine, tramadol and fentanyl - are used to treat pain caused by everything from heart attacks to cancer. But in the UK they were recently linked to the deaths of hundreds of elderly hospital patients, while the US is battling a well-documented opioid epidemic. Why not just use other painkillers to avoid the risk of harm? Opioids work by combining with receptors in the brain to reduce the sensation of pain - and they are highly effective.  However, opioid receptors are present in areas of the brain responsible for breath control and high doses can dangerously reduce the rate of breathing - the cause of almost all opioid deaths. An inquiry into the UK's Gosport War Memorial Hospital said more than 450 people died between 1989 and 2000 from administration of ""dangerous"" amounts of opioids without medical justification. In the US, the increasingly widespread prescription of opioids to treat long-term pain has led to an epidemic of addiction. In 2016, a record 11.5 million people in the US misused prescription opioids, and there were 42,249 deaths from overdoses.  In England, GPs prescribed 23.8 million opioid-based painkillers in 2017 - a rise of 10 million prescriptions since 2007. More than 2 million working-age people were thought to have taken a prescription painkiller that was not prescribed for them in 2016-17. There were more than 2,000 deaths in England related to opioid overdose in 2016, the highest since records began. But unlike the US deaths, these largely related to heroin rather than forms of opioid available on prescription. One of the reasons opioids are so widely used is that - when used correctly - they are a particularly useful form of painkiller. They can be given to patients in a variety of ways and in many different forms.  Morphine can be given orally or through injection; other opioids can be given through patches, lozenges or under-the-tongue tablets.  The Gosport report focused on syringe drivers, a method of delivering a drug under the skin, to provide a constant dose of an opioid for consistent pain relief.  This can be a useful form of pain relief at the end of someone's life as it means there is no reliance on the patient being able to swallow or absorb the drug. Syringe drivers also help doctors adjust dosage as necessary.   However, at Gosport War Memorial Hospital, syringe drivers were reportedly used when they weren't justified, or to deliver inappropriately high doses of opioid.  Despite their benefits, the problems associated with these medicines are clear. For decades, scientists have tried to develop opioids that work without causing the problems of addiction and misuse.  Some have added extra ingredients deliberately to cause a distressing reaction. For example, added to opioid tablets, the antidote naloxone largely has no side-effects if the medication is taken orally, but causes severe ""cold turkey"" withdrawal symptoms if the tablet is crushed and injected by a dependent user. Implants and slow-release injections which wear off over a much longer timeframe have also been investigated. A particular problem occurs when the need for pain relief is long-term - when the evidence for the benefit of opioids is less clear. In the US, one cause of the opioid epidemic is over-prescribing, particularly among those with long-term pain. More like this For people with acute pain, opioids can be used alongside other drugs - including commonplace painkillers like paracetamol, ibuprofen and aspirin. When treating patients who are dying, meticulous assessments of the causes of pain are needed to understand the best way to improve it, while minimising potential side-effects.  For example, cancer patients with pain as a result of nerve damage caused by chemotherapy might first be treated with paracetamol and a tricyclic antidepressant.  If that doesn't help, or the patient is in more severe pain, opioids may be introduced - again, this is often in combination with other drugs. For people who are dying, opioids are very often the most effective way to relieve pain. Anywhere between 30% and 94% of people with advanced cancer are thought to experience pain and about half of cancer patients were prescribed an opioid in the last three months of their life. If used appropriately, and used in amounts appropriate to patients' symptoms, opioids are not only safe, they are essential for good symptom control. The events in Gosport and the addiction crisis in the United States have put the medical profession's use of opioids under intense scrutiny.  Better education and training might be one way to make sure they are used appropriately for those who might benefit, so that potential harms are avoided.

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44872418,"One of the world's deadliest viruses, Ebola kills up to half of those it infects. But despite appearing to have all the hallmarks of a potential epidemic, the latest outbreak developed in a very different way. It was the ninth Ebola outbreak to hit the Democratic Republic of Congo in a decade, killing 29 people and leaving at least 60 children orphaned. While one death is too many, the West Africa epidemic of 2014-16 claimed more than 11,000 lives and it is hoped that later this week the most recent outbreak will be declared officially over by the World Health Organization. The relatively small number of deaths follows the use of an experimental vaccine, which may have saved hundreds, or even thousands of lives. Although the outbreak began in a remote area, there was a real danger that large numbers could be infected. It appeared close to neighbouring Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo - a vast area with a great ebb and flow of people and a fragile health system. It is also an area linked by river and road to the capital Kinshasa - home to 10 million people. The vaccine used, known as rVSV-ZEBOV was already in development during the 2014-16 epidemic. But by the time its effectiveness had been proven, the outbreak was already waning. When the virus returned in 2018, it could be quickly deployed, once the DRC government had approved its experimental use. This vaccine is designed for use against the Zaire strain of Ebola, which caused both this outbreak and the previous one.  Scientists and health workers set to work tracking all potential transmissions since the first case had been reported.  Front-line health workers, people in contact with confirmed Ebola cases, and their contacts all needed to be given the vaccine.   However, keeping the vaccine safe and making sure it reached the right people was not a straightforward task. The vaccine must be kept extremely cold, at minus 70C.  This is difficult and expensive to do in a remote environment with unreliable electricity. Alongside the vaccine, fridges and generators had to be flown into the region by helicopter. Isolation and treatment facilities had to be built, mobile laboratories set up and local laboratory technicians trained to test samples and confirm cases of Ebola.  For the vaccine to be effective, it had to be given to the right people.  Health workers spoke to patients, their families and the wider community to dispel rumours, build trust and avoid panic.  This, they explained to community leaders, was not a mass campaign. Vaccinations were given to the Ebola patient, plus a ""ring"" of friends, family and contacts - as well as healthcare workers and people involved in burials. All had to give their consent. Identifying and finding all the people suspected Ebola patients had been in contact with was a major challenge because of the location. Health workers had to travel by motorbike to places where there are no paved roads.  Despite these challenges, there has been high uptake rate and an estimated 98% of those eligible were vaccinated.  While the vaccination may have helped to save lives, better public health measures also played a crucial role in containing the outbreak. Treatment centres and isolation zones were set up to reduce the spread of the virus and face-masks, gowns and gloves were used.  Safe burial practices also helped to limit transmission of the virus, as did screening of passengers at international and domestic ports and airports. There has also been work to reintegrate survivors with their community because in former outbreaks survivors were sometimes ostracised by their families and neighbours.   More like this In the three months since the outbreak began, more than 3,000 people in the region have been vaccinated.  As a result of its use - and the other precautionary measures - the epidemic is likely to end quicker than might have been expected.  But unfortunately this isn't the end of the road for Ebola, as we know it is a disease that will continue to appear in future. Two years after it was first tested, the vaccine still works, but we don't yet know how long-lasting the protection will be.   More than one Ebola vaccine is needed, so we're not reliant on just one manufacturer.  It would also be helpful to have options for different situations - such as a single shot vaccine for quick protection and booster vaccines when there isn't an outbreak.   Researchers need to find out more about what works and why, so more lives can be saved.  To do that, we need to stop thinking of these outbreaks as isolated events - introducing a long-term programme of research and response into every Ebola outbreak. And while Ebola is high profile, we also need to remember it isn't the only disease that could lead to an epidemic.  DRC is facing a worrying outbreak of polio that has paralysed 29 children and there are outbreaks of Lassa Fever in Nigeria and the Nipah virus in India.  It's impossible to predict what the next epidemic will be, but we can be better prepared.  At-risk countries need tools and support to strengthen their health systems and monitor disease, so that they are ready before an outbreak and can save as many lives as possible.

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44888954,"Suzanne Ruart's son Aiden spent three months in a neonatal unit as a result of being born three months early. A year after her son came home Suzanne realised she'd been suppressing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).   ""After the first time I saw him resuscitated I developed a crippling anxiety that every time I walked into the neonatal unit there would be bad news, and this anxiety has never really left me since.  ""I manage it now because I talk a lot about it, but at the time all focus was on Aiden, and so I never let myself think about the feelings I was going through.""  New research by the charity Bliss has found that 62% of parents of premature babies reported they had no access to formal psychological support, such as counselling or talking therapies, while their baby was on a neonatal unit.  Of the survey of 589 parents, 16% of parents were diagnosed with PTSD after their time on the neonatal unit. More than a third said their mental health was ""significantly worse"" and just 8% felt they'd received the right amount of formal psychological support. Suzanne said she was told that Bliss offered counselling, but that during the first few days everything was a blur so she didn't take up the offer.   ""I needed support on those first few nights when I went back to my hospital room alone, without my baby or husband or any family, and lay and cried the entire night through thinking I may well have changed the future of my little baby by delivering him early.""  In the following months, she said that while watching her son having painful procedures she could ""physically feel"" what he was going through.  ""I would have done anything to take the pain instead of Aiden but you just have to stand by and watch.  ""Then there is the heartbreak of seeing parents whose babies are not doing as well as yours. The awe of watching the doctors and nurses fight for a little life is inspiring but you see the broken-hearted parents being assisted out of the ward and your heart breaks for them. ""I also felt a strange sense of guilt at times that my baby was on his way up - and they were devastated with no hope left."" Bliss says all parents on neonatal units should have access to psychological and social support, including a trained counsellor.   A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are committed to giving every mother and baby the best start in life. This is why we have invested ¬£365 million to transform perinatal mental health services, so that 30,000 more women each year can access specialist care."" Suzanne thinks more support is needed to ""let parents know that it's OK not to be OK.""  ""There is so much focus on keeping positive and on how the baby is doing - rightly so - that you don't feel you should show it when you aren't coping - you just try to keep upbeat."" The survey also found that 45% of parents said they had no access to formal psychological support when they needed it after leaving the neonatal unit. ""On the day I left the neonatal unit to take Aiden home, I cried like I have never cried before,"" says Suzanne. ""Some of it was tears of joy to be taking him to where he belonged - albeit on oxygen and a list of drugs - but mostly it was because I didn't want to leave my neonatal unit family who had supported me so amazingly. ""I was also scared about taking the baton of care over from them. How would I cope when things went wrong and would I be strong enough to do it alone?  ""This fear crept into my sleep and I woke many nights screaming in bed that Aiden was dead."" She said it was ""terrifying"" and ""very isolating"" as you are confined to your home, keeping your baby away from germs and you can't go out to baby groups.  ""Around a year after he was home - just as he came off his oxygen support - I had a very powerful, vivid and crippling flashback that made me realise that I had been suppressing many symptoms of PTSD.""  She thinks it needs to be made clearer to parents of premature babies that they are at risk of PTSD, and that it is normal to feel overwhelmed by the experience.  ""Once I realised that, I knew I had to do something so I looked for advice online and I faced into the memories I'd been suppressing.  ""Now, four years on, I can still occasionally be blindsided by a memory, a sight or a sound, but I feel like I am much stronger mentally now that I have recognised that I needed help.""",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44801139,"A new drug to treat malaria has been given the green light by authorities in the United States.  The medicine is specifically for the recurring form of malaria - caused by the parasite plasmodium vivax - which makes 8.5 million people ill each year.  This type of malaria is a particular challenge to get rid of as it can remain dormant in the liver for years before reawakening many times.  Scientists have described tafenoquine as a ""phenomenal achievement.""  Regulators around the world will now look at the drug to see if they can recommend it for their populations.  Recurring malaria is the most common type of malaria outside Sub-Saharan Africa.   Children can be particularly at risk, getting several bouts of malaria from a single bite, missing lots of school and getting weaker each time they get the disease.  And infected people can act as unwitting reservoirs of the disease because when the parasite reawakens in their bodies a mosquito can carry that parasite on to someone else.  This can make it hard to eliminate around the world.  Now the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States has given the seal of approval to tafenoquine, a drug that can flush the parasite out of its hiding place in the liver and stop people getting it again.  It can be taken alongside another medicine to treat the immediate infection.  There is already a medication that can be used to get rid of malaria hiding in the liver called primaquine.  But unlike the single dose of tafenoquine needed, primaquine often needs to be taken for 14 days.  Some experts are concerned that many people feel better after just a few days and stop taking the pills, allowing the parasite to awaken at a later date.  The FDA says the drug is effective and approves it for use in the United States but points out that there are important side effects to be aware of.  For example people with an enzyme problem, called G6PD deficiency, should not take the drug as it can cause severe anaemia. The regulator recommends people are tested for the deficiency for this before it is given - which can pose a problem in poorer areas where malaria is common.  There are also concerns that at higher doses it can be a problem for people with psychiatric illnesses.  But despite these cautions there is hope the drug, together with bed nets and other precautions, will help reduce the amount of vivax malaria in the world.  Prof Ric Price, of Oxford University, told the BBC: ""The ability to get rid of the parasite in the liver with a single dose of tafenoquine is a phenomenal achievement and in my mind it represents one of the most significant advances in malaria treatment in the last 60 years."" Meanwhile Dr Hal Barron, president of research and development at GSK, the company that manufactures the drug, said it was a significant milestone for people living with this type of relapsing malaria.  ""Together with our partner, Medicines for Malaria Venture, we believe Krintafel will be an important medicine for patients with malaria and contribute to the ongoing effort to eradicate this disease."" Tafenonquine has been in existence since the 1970s but working with Medicines for Malaria, GSK has repurposed the drug so that it can be used to get rid of malaria parasites in the liver.  The next step will be for the drug to be assessed by regulators in countries where this form of malaria is a significant problem.",,,,
1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-44920193,"Authorities in China have ordered an investigation into a vaccination scandal as panic grows over product safety.  Last week vaccine maker Changsheng Biotechnology Co was found to have falsified production data for its rabies vaccine. The firm has been ordered to halt production and recall rabies vaccines.  There has been no evidence of harm from the vaccine, but the scandal has sparked a huge outcry in China. Changsheng, which suspended trading in its shares for part of Monday, saw their value drop by 10% on the day.  The shares have slumped 47% since mid-July, when news of the scandal first broke. On Sunday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged severe punishment for the people involved, saying the incident had ""crossed a moral line"". ""We will resolutely crack down on illegal and criminal acts that endanger the safety of peoples' lives, resolutely punish lawbreakers according to the law, and resolutely and severely criticise dereliction of duty in supervision,"" he said in a statement posted on a government website. Changsheng has apologised, saying that it was ""guilty and embarrassed"" and would co-operate with drug regulators to carry out a comprehensive internal investigation. On 15 July, China's State Drug Administration (SDA) announced that Changchun Changsheng had falsified production data during the production of its freeze-dried human rabies vaccine. According to a report by Xinhua, an official said the company had ""fabricated production records and product inspection records"", as well as ""arbitrarily changed process parameters and equipment"" during production. The China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) said the rabies vaccine had been recalled and that the company would be put under investigation. Days later, Jilin province authorities announced a 2017 batch of the firm's diptheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine - or DTaP - was also substandard.  According to state media outlet CGTN, more than 250,000 doses of DTaP in the batch had already been sold to disease control and prevention centres in eastern China. The company has now been ordered to pay a fine of 3.4m yuan ($510,000; ¬£387,957). According to the CFDA, there is no evidence that anyone has been harmed by the vaccine.  Concern has now shifted to the safety of the DTaP vaccine.  The vaccine is subsidised by the government and is given to infants across the country.  It is not known how many children have received the vaccine, but there have not been any reports of children falling ill after receiving the inoculation.  The Chinese government has not said what impact the substandard vaccine could have on a person's health.  People are furious.  ""Thousands of mothers around the country are worried. Over 200,000 children could be affected. What kind of society am I living in?"" asked one person on Weibo.  ""My son will be vaccinated next month. I don't know whether or not to let him,"" said another. Chinese censors have also identified the issue as highly sensitive. A widely circulated article pointing out murky practices in the vaccine industry in China was deleted.  This is not the first time substandard vaccines have been produced in China. In 2016, an illegal vaccine ring which involved hundreds of people was uncovered.  Some $88m worth of vaccines were found to be inadequately refrigerated and were not transported in approved conditions.",,,,

""The Government's childhood obesity plan is encouraging but if the policies within it are not quickly enacted, more children are going to face a life that's limited in quality and expectancy"" he said.

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44821886,"The number of antidepressants prescribed to children in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland has risen over the past three years, figures obtained by BBC's File on 4 reveal. In England, there was a 15% rise. Scotland saw a 10% increase. And in Northern Ireland the number rose by 6%.  In total, there were 950,000 prescriptions issued between April 2015 and March 2018. Experts have linked the rise to waits for specialist mental health services. Antidepressants should prescribed to children only under close supervision. NHS England, NHS Scotland and the Health and Social Care Board in Northern Ireland all say they are committed to improving child mental health services. NHS Wales was unable to provide prescription figures because it does not hold the data requested. The figures were obtained by Freedom of Information requests and relate to a group of powerful antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  The total number of prescriptions rose from 290,393 in 2015-16 to 330,616 in 2017-18.  The steepest increase was seen in the youngest patients, those aged 12 and under, where the number of prescriptions rose on average by 24%, from 14,500 to almost 18,000. Dr Bernadka Dubicka, who chairs the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said:  ""Currently only one in four children and young people are treated for their mental health problems.  ""The fact that prescriptions for antidepressants are rising could reflect a slow but steady move towards treating everyone who is unwell.  ""But the importance of giving children access to psychological therapies cannot be overstated.  ""What we don't know from today's data is why these antidepressants are being prescribed, and how.  ""It is vital that they are being used judiciously, monitored carefully, and the risks and benefits of taking them are assessed in each individual case."" The mental health charity Young Minds says waiting times for specialist child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) have been increasing too, making it difficult for families to get support. Marc Bush, chief policy advisor at Young Minds, said: ""The government recently suggested that the average waiting time for general access to Camhs is around 12 weeks, which is a long time to be in distress. ""And that is why front-line professionals are turning to prescription pads, because they're thinking, 'I'm seeing someone in front of me in crisis with a level of distress I don't want to leave them with - how do I offer them some kind of alleviation from that?'"" In rare cases, antidepressants can trigger thoughts of suicide and self-harm in children. And the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has clear guidelines: However, File on 4 has heard concerns these guidelines are not always followed.  Reece Burrowes, 17, was found dead in a park in south-east London on 6 December 2015, days after being prescribed an antidepressant called Sertraline by his GPs. Although the inquest into Reece's death recorded a verdict of death by suicide and no blame was assigned to Reece's doctors or Sertraline, File on 4 has been told several of the NICE prescribing guidelines were not followed by doctors.  Reece's stepfather, Simon Banks, said: ""There are NICE guidelines, which you know in theory they should follow, but I know one of the concerns is that their thinking, 'If I do refer them to Camhs, there's potentially a waiting list.'   ""From what we've gone through, our view would be don't give the medication, and wait. ""But I can imagine it's a very difficult call for the doctor to make."" Dr Shruti Garg, a Camhs consultant at the Manchester Foundation NHS Trust, said problems with young people transitioning out of Camhs services could also be leading to increases in prescription rates. ""Camhs services across most parts of the country cover only up to the age of 16 - adult mental health services start at 18, so there is a gap for the provision of services across these services."" The Department of Health in England told the BBC it had pledged ¬£1.7bn to transform Camhs.  This, it said, would help to provide greater access to a wider range of therapies, although there would still be patients who would benefit from antidepressants. In Scotland, Minister for Mental Health Clare Haughey said young people's mental health was a priority and ¬£5m has been invested to create a taskforce to improve Camhs services. The Health and Social Care Board in Northern Ireland said the vast majority of referrals accepted into Camhs were seen within nine weeks and it was currently planning to spend an extra ¬£1m on Camhs projects.

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44936752,"A simple eye test carried out by opticians could help predict who is at risk of developing dementia, a study suggests. The test is usually done to spot early signs of eye disease, by looking at tissue at the back of the eye - the retina.  Now scientists have found people with thinner retinas are more likely to have problems with memory and reasoning. Researchers believe the test could be used to screen for early dementia. The study of 32,000 people measured parts of the retina, and in particular the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Study participants, who were between the ages of 40 and 69, were also assessed on their memory, reaction time and reasoning.  Scientists found those with the thinnest RNFLs were more likely to fail one or more of the tests. They were also twice as likely to score worse in follow-up assessments over the next three years, the study published in JAMA Neurology found.  Memory loss, difficulty with carrying out familiar tasks and other types of cognitive decline can be early symptoms of dementia.  Prof Paul Foster, from the University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, co-lead author of the paper, said OCT tests could help identify people at high risk of developing the disease. Prof Foster added: ""It is likely that treatments will be more effective in slowing or stopping dementia at earlier stages of the disease. ""Also, by targeting people in the earlier stages, it should be possible to design better clinical trials for treatments that make a real difference and improve people's lives."" An association between deterioration in the retina and optic nerves, and people who have established dementia had already been known. But researchers said their study suggested such changes could be spotted with OCT tests even in the early stages of cognitive decline. Experts say deterioration in the retina may mirror changes going on in the blood vessels in the brain, which could play a role in the development of the disease.   However, other scientists have questioned the link between RNFL thickness and dementia, arguing that it does not reliably predict cognitive ability. Researchers said an advantage of OCT tests is that they offer a relatively inexpensive and non-invasive way to screen for dementia.  But they said the tests should probably not be done in isolation to screen for dementia, as there would be people with thinner retinas who did not go on to experience cognitive decline. Dr Laura Phipps, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said exploring how the eye can be used as a window into early brain changes was a growing area of research. She said it would be interesting to see whether further studies showed that a greater likelihood of cognitive decline in those with thinner retinas also translated into an increased risk of dementia. ""With future treatments for Alzheimer's and other dementias likely to be most effective when given early in the disease process, research into sensitive and non-invasive early markers of disease is vital.  ""The brain is well protected by the skull and current approaches for detecting brain changes - such as brain scans - can be expensive to use routinely.  ""While a diagnosis of dementia will always rely on results from a number of different tests, further studies should look at how sensitive OCT could be at identifying those most at risk of cognitive decline in the general population."" The charity added that it was co-funding a study which analysed eye scans to look for features that could indicate the presence of dementia.",,,,

But the problem isn't the lotion, it's our slapdash application of it, King's College London scientists say.  In theory, using sun protection factor (SPF) 15 sunscreen should be enough to stop sun damage.   But in reality, people need SPF 30 or 50 to be safe, say the study authors, who carried out experiments with volunteers in their lab.   It comes as temperatures are set to reach 33C in London on Thursday afternoon amid reports of the heat placing a strain on some health services. Nick Scriven, president of the Society of Acute Medicine, said one doctor had told him their hospital had been busy at the weekend, with patients needing treatment for conditions linked to dehydration, including chest and urine infections. Kim Sunley, national officer at the Royal College of Nursing, said nurses had reported temperatures in excess of 30C on some hospital wards. She told the BBC: ""We know wards are reaching over 30C, nurses are feeling sick, dizzy, having problems with their concentration.  ""And that then does have an impact on how they care for their patients, making decisions around drugs calculations and just generally doing a physical occupation."" Visits to the NHS Choices website for heat-related health advice so far this month are up nearly 450% compared to July last year.  Factor 50 lotion applied in the typical way would, at best, provide 40% of the expected protection, said Prof Anthony Young, whose team measured how much protection people got from wearing different amounts of suntan lotions with varying SPF strengths.   Sunscreen needs to be applied thickly enough, which many of us fail to do.  SPF ratings are based on the assumption that a 2mg blob will cover 1 sq cm of skin. That means you should apply at least six full teaspoons (36g) to cover the body of an average adult. More than half a teaspoon to: More than one teaspoon to: Areas such as the sides of the neck, temples and ears are commonly missed, so take extra care and apply liberally. It is also easy to forget to reapply sunscreen as often as necessary.  The British Association of Dermatologists advises:  Some lotions say they are water resistant, meaning they retain some sun protection properties after immersion.  However, up to 85% of a product can be removed by towel drying, so you should reapply after swimming, sweating, or any other vigorous or abrasive activity. Another important factor is the reflection of the Sun's rays, which can greatly increase the power of the radiation: snow by up to 85% increase, sand by up to 17% and water by up to 5%. Source: NHS Choices People with fair skin that burns easily, many moles or freckles, red or fair hair and light-coloured eyes are most at risk of sun damage. Sunscreens should not be used to stay outside longer or just to avoid more reliable protective measures such as clothing and shade. Nina Goad, of the British Association of Dermatologists, said: ""This research demonstrates why it's so important to choose an SPF of 30 or more.  ""It also shows why we shouldn't rely on sunscreen alone for sun protection, but we should also use clothing and shade."" The heatwave is set to continue across many parts of the UK this week.  Public Health England advises people try to keep cool and take shelter. ""To beat the heat, try to keep out of the sun from 11:00 to 15:00, walk in the shade if you can, apply sunscreen and wear a hat if you have to go out in the heat,"" it says. ""Also try to carry water with you when travelling.""",,,,

Lesley Brown held the mementoes, including hospital appointment cards and correspondence, after the birth of her daughter Louise in July 1978. They were stored in a wardrobe at the family's Bristol home and only found following Mrs Brown's death in 2012. Louise Brown donated them to Bristol Archives which is displaying them. Her mother and father, John, were the first couple to successfully undergo in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and their daughter was born at Oldham General Hospital on 25 July 1978. The family was sent hundreds of cards from well-wishers, as well as letters from women struggling to conceive. Louise Brown, now herself a mother-of-two, said: ""My mum kept everything concerned with my birth from the appointment cards when she was trying for a baby right through to all the correspondence from journalists and people all over the world following my birth. ""Now that IVF is an established worldwide technique I thought it was important that people get a true view of how it all started from our family point of view."" Bristol Archives received a grant to catalogue and conserve it and parts of the Lesley Brown Collection will be displayed at the Science Museum in London and later at Bristol's M Shed museum from December. In one letter from December 1977, Dr Robert Edwards wrote: ""The early results on your blood and urine samples are very encouraging, and indicate that you might be in early pregnancy. So please take things quietly - no skiing, climbing, or anything too strenuous including Xmas shopping!""

Women taking part in the Dutch study had been given the tablets to improve growth of their unborn children because they had poorly-developed placentas.  It appears the drug, which promotes blood flow, may have caused lethal damage to the babies' lungs. Experts say a full investigation is needed to understand what happened.  There is no suggestion that there was any wrong-doing.  Earlier trials in the UK and Australia and New Zealand did not find any evidence of potential harm from the intervention. But they also found no benefit.  At that time, in 2010, researchers said the treatment should be used only in trials.  Foetal growth restriction caused by an underdeveloped placenta is a serious condition that currently has no treatment.  It can mean babies are born prematurely, with a very low birth weight and poor chances of survival. A medication that could improve weight or prolong the time to delivery could have significant advantages for these very sick babies. The latest Dutch study, which was due to run until 2020, was being carried out across 11 hospitals in the Netherlands, including the Amsterdam University Medical Centre.  In total, 93 women were given sildenafil (the non-brand name for Viagra) while the remaining 90 were given a dummy drug or placebo.  Twenty babies developed lung problems after birth - three in the placebo group and the rest in the treatment group.  Eleven in the sildenafil group died from lung complications. The drug used was not made by Pfizer, which manufactures Viagra, and the safety of the use of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction is not being questioned. Prof Zarcko Alfirevic, from the University of Liverpool, who led part of the UK research into sildenafil in pregnancy that found no benefit in terms of improving baby growth, said: ""This finding in the Dutch study is unexpected.  ""We need to be careful at this point to find out more.

The policy decision brings England into line with Scotland and Wales.  HPV vaccine is already routinely offered to girls of the same age at secondary school and is free up until they turn 18. Experts and campaigners have been calling for equal access to the jab, which can also guard against oral, throat and anal cancers.  HPV is the name given to a large group of viruses, which can be caught through any kind of sexual contact with another person who already has it. Doctors say most HPV infections go away by themselves, but sometimes infections can lead to a variety of serious problems. For boys, this includes cancer of the anus, penis, mouth and throat. The vaccine has been offered to girls since 2008 as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme, with boys being said to benefit through herd protection. But there is still a risk of infection in those who go on to have sex with other men or with women who have not been vaccinated. Thousands of boys in England are expected to be vaccinated under the programme each year, which is likely to start from 2019-20. Girls aged 12 to 13 in Northern Ireland are also eligible for the vaccine, but no decision has been taken on whether to make it available to boys living there.   Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""This extended programme offers us the opportunity to make HPV related diseases a thing of the past and build on the success of the girls' programme, which has already reduced the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18, the main cancer-causing types, by over 80%.

The light-headed feeling is caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure, which is known as orthostatic hypotension (OH). Participants with the condition in the study of 11,709 people in the USA had a significantly higher risk of developing dementia or having a stroke. However, feeling dizzy sometimes is often not a sign of a serious illness. The American Academy of Neurology studied people for an average 25 years. And the average age of the participants was 54.  Study author Andreea Rawlings said OH had been previously linked to heart disease, so her team wanted to know if it could also be responsible for brain conditions. ""Measuring orthostatic hypotension in middle age may be a new way to identify people who need to be carefully monitored for dementia or stroke,"" she said.  ""More studies are needed to clarify what may be causing these links as well as to investigate possible prevention strategies."" One limitation of the study was that participants were tested for OH only during the initial examination, so it may not reflect any change in blood pressure over time. During the study: None of the participants had any previous history of heart disease or stroke. Source: NHS Choices Dementia UK's chief executive and chief admiral nurse, Dr Hilda Hayo, told the BBC: ""This study adds to our recognition of low blood pressure as a potential risk factor for dementia in some people.  ""The advice on keeping the heart and blood vessels healthy in order to delay or prevent the onset of dementia applies equally to people with low or high blood pressure.""

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44966341,"The news that Brigitte Nielsen has given birth at the age of 54 has focused attention on the rising numbers of older mothers.  The actress, who gave birth to daughter Frida in June, felt compelled to defend her decision to critics.  ""Some women think, 'Oh my God, I'm too old,' But how many men have their first kids in their 60s and 70s and they never doubt it?  ""I totally respect that not everybody likes it, but it is my life, and my husband and I have a solid relationship,"" she told People magazine.  Nielsen married Mattia Dessi, who is 39, in 2006, and started freezing her eggs at 40. She said she was given a 3-4% chance of conceiving with her own eggs, and was successful after trying with IVF for 14 years.  Frida is her first child with Dessi, although the Danish actress has four other sons from previous marriages.  The numbers of older mothers are growing, with conception rates for women over 40 more than doubling since 1990. Figures released this year by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed conception rates in 2016, the latest year there are figures for, had decreased in all age groups, except for those aged 40 and over, where the rate increased by 2%. The data does not currently isolate those mothers who are over 50, but experts at fertility clinics say that anecdotally the numbers of women seeking treatment in their late 40s and 50s are rising.  Dr Janine Elson, group medical director of leading IVF clinic the CARE Fertility Group, says they are being approached by increasing numbers of women desiring to get pregnant over the age of 50, and have designed a new information leaflet specifically for those women.  She emphasised that although many older women have perfectly healthy children, the risks increase with age.  Women over 50 will most likely be using donor eggs, unless they have frozen their own eggs when younger.  ""We would do a more intense screening of women over the age of 50 as they are at a higher risk of early onset diabetes, high cholesterol and early breast cancer,"" she says. Despite the trend for older motherhood, anyone giving birth from their late 30s onwards is considered at a greater risk of raised blood pressure, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. If they are using their own eggs, the risks of genetic abnormality increase with age.   Women in their 50s shouldn't necessarily experience any problems with breastfeeding, but there may be the additional challenges posed by potentially going through the menopause after birth.  Dr Elson added: ""Once you've got past the pregnancy, the hormones will subside and women may go into menopause and experience emotional fragility and hot flushes alongside sleepless nights from the baby. ""That said, women in their 50s may feel more comfortable asking for help and accessing services than much younger women.""  Rise in mothers aged over 45 Freeze ovaries to boost fertility Another issue for much older mothers is a lack of peer support. Although mothers in their early 40s are now common at the school gates, there are far fewer to be found in their late 40s and 50s.  Dr Zeynep Gurtin, is Senior Research Associate at the London Women's Clinic and visiting researcher at the Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge. ""All mothers need support from peers and one of the issues is there aren't any support groups for older mothers.""  Gartin agrees with Brigitte Nielsen that older mothers are judged far more harshly than older fathers.  ""Nobody bats an eyelid about George Clooney becoming a father of twins aged 56. When it comes to fathers, we assume they can be more removed, less hands-on.  ""Women, on the other hand, are accused of being selfish for leaving motherhood too late."" The London Women's clinic treats women with donor eggs up to the age of 54.  ""We don't have a national cut-off date in the UK, so we go with what we consider is appropriate, taking into account the welfare of the child. ""  The clinic has also seen a threefold increase between 2004 and 2015 in younger women freezing their eggs.

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44968386,"Specialist doctors in the UK will be able to legally prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products by autumn, the home secretary has announced. Those that meet safety and quality standards are to be made legal for patients with an ""exceptional clinical need"", Sajid Javid said. As it is a devolved matter, it will require legislative change before it is enforced in Northern Ireland. Legalisation follows high-profile cases involving severely epileptic children. Many had previously been denied access to cannabis oil. Others forms of cannabis will remain illegal. Mr Javid's decision was made after the chief medical officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said patients with certain medical conditions should be given access to the treatments. Their advice was part of a review into medicinal cannabis launched by the home secretary following an outcry over Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley being denied access to cannabis oil. The parents of the boys, who have rare forms of epilepsy, say it controls their seizures.  The Home Office recently granted them licences to access the treatments.  Mr Javid said: ""Recent cases involving sick children made it clear to me that our position on cannabis-related medicinal products was not satisfactory.   ""That is why we launched a review and set up an expert panel to advise on licence applications in exceptional circumstances. ""This will help patients with an exceptional clinical need but is in no way a first step to the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use."" Billy Caldwell's mother, Charlotte, said Mr Javid's announcement had been made on her son's 13th birthday. ""For the first time in months I'm almost lost for words, other than 'thank you Sajid Javid',"" she said.  ""Never has Billy received a better birthday present, and never from somebody so unexpected... ""But, crucially, my little boy Billy can now live a normal life with his mummy because of the simple ability to now administer a couple of drops a day of a long-maligned but entirely effective natural medication."" A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""The rescheduling of cannabis-derived medicinal products is a devolved matter and requires legislative change. ""The Department of Health notes the advice provided by experts during the two-part review commissioned by the Home Secretary.   ""Consideration will be given to rescheduling cannabis-derived medicinal products in Northern Ireland in line with the rest of the UK  ""In the interim, clinicians may still apply to the Home Office Expert Panel should they wish to use a cannabis-based medicine in the treatment of a patient.""  Cannabis is classed as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning it is judged to have no therapeutic value but can be used for the purposes of research with a Home Office licence. The decision by the Home Office will put certain cannabis-derived products into Schedule 2 - those that have a potential medical use - and will place them in the same category as cocaine and heroin, among other drugs.  The Department for Health and Social Care and the Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will now develop a clear definition of what constitutes a cannabis-derived medicinal product so they can be rescheduled and prescribed, the Home Office said.  In the meantime, clinicians will still be able to apply to an independent expert panel on behalf of patients wishing to access these products.  The home secretary said licence fees for applications made to the panel will be waived, and those already granted will not be charged. The home secretary's decision was welcomed by campaigners and health experts. Donna Kinnair, from the Royal College of Nursing, said the decision was ""very welcome"". Dr Tom Freeman, senior academic fellow at King's College London, said Mr Javid's decision would have a ""substantial impact on research by facilitating the development of safer and more effective medicines"". Former justice minister Sir Mike Penning, who was among those appealing for Alfie Dingley to be given a special licence for medicinal cannabis, welcomed the announcement but said there were still unanswered questions about which treatments would be rescheduled.

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44910438,"For almost two years, I experienced pains I did not tell friends about. Burning and stinging in your genital area don't make for good dinner-party conversation.  But I'm now writing about it precisely because, as I found out, many men like me needlessly suffer in silence.  At the onset in mid-2016, urologists tested me for prostate cancer, an obvious concern for a male in his 50s. When this was ruled out, they sent me away.  Although no longer a matter of medical concern, my symptoms were very much still there. An aching penis, a sore rectum and an inflamed perineum were taking turns as affliction of the day.    It was overshadowing my life. Sitting was difficult. I could walk only slowly. Running, my exercise of choice, was out of the question. And sex loses its appeal when your nether regions are a source of suffering rather than fun. Looking online for clues, I realised that I was not alone. ""Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis"" is by far the most common type of prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate). Also known as ""chronic pelvic pain syndrome"" (CPPS), it is estimated to affect about 8% of men at any one time. Doctors don't know what causes CPPS. I kept a diary to track the ups and downs of my pains and found no correlations with what I did, ate or drank. Treatment is equally elusive: antibiotics and inflammation drugs don't work.  The NHS website offers scant hope: ""The aim is to reduce symptoms to a level where they interfere less with day-to-day activities, rather than getting rid of the pain completely."" I tried various tricks. I found hot baths soothing. Soft cushions made sitting bearable: I brought one to work, telling colleagues it was more comfortable.  But the prospect of spending the rest of my life managing pain was dispiriting. I got my first hopeful insight that autumn by reading a book by Tim Parks, a British writer living in Italy. Teach Us To Sit Still describes how Parks overcame an acute version of the syndrome through Vipassana meditation, or ""mindfulness"".   This sounded kooky, but I was ready to listen to anyone who said CPPS was not a life sentence. It helped that I identified with Parks. Like me, he'd settled in a foreign country that had given him a foreign culture and a wife to love; he lived largely through words; he was anxious and intense, prone to overreacting and internalising emotion; he did not believe in New Age healing, or any form of spirituality.  Parks, after reading about a therapy for CPPS devised by US medics at Stanford University, had concluded that the pain was produced by tension: anxiety is often stored in muscles and pelvic musculature is particularly vulnerable as it is intertwined with nerves. The solution lay in calming a restless mind. I decided to give meditation a go. Every morning I sat focusing on my breath for up to an hour. I did it both at home and on public transport. When you meditate you don't care what people think.  Not caring is what meditation is about. Sounds, sensations, and ultimately your own thoughts, come to you free of judgement or context, like the helicopter noises and snatches of conversations that come and go in Pink Floyd tracks.  The same goes for pain. Instead of experiencing it directly, I observed the fact that I was someone who was hurting. The pain had become an object of compassion rather than raw distress. Over time, I noticed a reduction in its intensity and frequency.  The improvement was all the more remarkable because I remained concerned for some time that I might have cancer. Three months after a urologist gave me a clean bill of health, I went to see another one about my continuing symptoms.   When I told him about meditating, he was quick to reclaim my body for science. ""Just because you and I have nervous personalities, it doesn't mean there's nothing wrong with us,"" he said.  He pointed out that my Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) count, a possible indicator of cancer, was high and rising. I had to undergo a biopsy, which involves inserting needles through your backside to collect cells from your prostate.   The procedure feels as barbaric as it sounds. The ""discomfort"" that doctors breezily warn you about can only be lessened with strong opiates. You urinate blood for weeks.   Then there was the wait for the results. Prostate cancer is often treatable, and online calculators put my chances of having it at only 15%. But being an unlucky roll of the dice away from any form of cancer was unnerving.  I had visions of being made permanently impotent and incontinent by surgery.  But mindfulness helped me keep those fears in perspective. My pelvic pains continued to lessen both before and after I got the final all-clear.  Physical exercise was as important as the meditation. Swimming twice a week palpably relaxed my pelvic muscles. So did daily stretches - those that brought me the most relief more or less replicated Monty Python's Ministry of Silly Walks sketch (John Cleese, a one-time prostatitis sufferer, may have got useful practice in advance). Every patient, however, is different.  CPPS does not lend itself to traditional, off-the-shelf medical treatment. Urologists can save your life if you have cancer, but are largely helpless when it comes to a little-understood, multifactor condition like CPPS.  ""Many of them don't like treating it,"" says Jonathan Rees, a North Somerset-based GP who co-wrote the prostatitis guidelines for Prostate Cancer UK. ""Urologists tend to dispense antibiotics and when people don't get better they can run out of options.""   The best hope for patients, Dr Rees says, is finding a person, whether a GP or a pain specialist, with a special interest in the condition. For me, that person was Karl, a sports massage therapist and former CPPS sufferer who runs a pelvic pain clinic in London. I sought him out because after 10 months, I felt my progress was too slow.  It is not all ""in the mind"" - you cannot meditate away diabetes or kidney stones. But clinical trials have suggested that mindfulness practices may have health benefits, including: Over a year, Karl listened to me, devised specific stretches and, most importantly, changed the way I approached my symptoms. ""The idea that you can control your pain makes some people freak out,"" he told me. ""But I find it liberating.""  He taught me to stop dwelling on what was wrong. Early on, he got me to ditch the cushion, which he said was focusing my mind back on the condition.  When I told Karl that my diary confirmed his method was working, he suggested that the pain chart was another security blanket to discard. My improvement continued, no less tangible for remaining unrecorded.  Last December, I had my first pain-free days in 18 months. Soon they became the norm.  Admittedly, there is no proof that a switch in mindset cured me. No-one has done a rigorous study on meditation as a treatment for CPPS. It is possible that I would have got better anyway. And it might not work for others. But my path to healing is consistent with an emerging medical consensus about the link between mental stress and pain. Any form of chronic pain, Dr Rees points out, involves ""central sensitisation"", where the brain becomes overly receptive to signals sent by nerves.‚ÄØThe more you fear pain, the more you feel it.  Conversely, he says, being relaxed makes you less responsive to pain signals: ""The mind is such a big factor in the way we respond to pain.""  Dr Rees finds it entirely possible that my mind went into overdrive following a prostate inflammation - as suggested by my PSA count - and that meditation slowly broke that vicious circle.  Leaving aside any therapeutic effects from meditation, I found it to be its own reward. Whenever a twinge comes, in the pelvic area or elsewhere, I now take a deep breath and regard it as something else to rise above.   The condition, in a strange way, has been a blessing. As I approach my 60s I feel better prepared for the inevitable bodily challenges of the years ahead.",,,,

Yet a new study contradicts this, suggesting that boys are more likely to form tight-knit friendship groups.  Researchers say analysing social mixing patterns is important for infectious diseases and vaccination planning.  They found that boys were more likely to mix with the same six friends over a period of six months. Girls' friendships, however, were more variable.  The study, published on Wednesday in scientific journal Plos One, was led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in partnership with the University of Cambridge. Scientists use complex mathematical models to look at how diseases spread through social groupings.   And this research could help predict more accurately how they will spread - and might one day lead to changes in advice on how infectious diseases are controlled. Researchers asked 460 Year 7 pupils across four UK secondary schools representing a range of socioeconomic areas to name the six children they spent most time with daily, between January and June 2015.  Lead author Dr Adam Kucharski said: ""Showing boys are potentially more cliquey than girls, perhaps going against gender stereotypes, and that popular children remain popular over time, is an interesting social insight - but for mathematical modellers this type of information is also extremely valuable.   ""Understanding age-specific social mixing patterns is vital for studying outbreaks of infectious diseases like flu and measles, which can spread rapidly, particularly among children.  ""Mathematical models that predict the spread of infectious diseases are now an essential part of public health decisions for the introduction of new vaccines."" Another of the study's authors, Dr Clare Wenham, now assistant professor in global health policy at the London School of Economics, said: ""Kids are a very important part of looking at how diseases spread.  ""Previous studies have only looked at how children mix over one day, so with this study we wanted to see how it changed over time. ""It would also be good to extend the study over a longer period to see how friendship groups changed over the years."" Dr Terri Apter, a psychologist and former Cambridge tutor, who has written extensively on teenagers and friendships, said: ""It has been observed that boys' friendships are more stable and girls' are more volatile.  ""As a result, girls might feel more pressure to have 'just in case' friends in case they fall out with their best friend and they feel more social pressure to be friendly with people that aren't really their friends than boys.  ""All this leads to a larger, more changeable group.""",,,,

The Queen's granddaughter had announced in 2016 that a pregnancy announced the previous month had ended in a miscarriage. Now she has told the Sunday Times she later suffered another miscarriage before becoming pregnant with her daughter Lena, who was born in June. She said for a time ""you don't talk about it because it's too raw"". ""But as with everything, time's a great healer,"" she said. The Olympic medal-winning equestrian is married to ex-England rugby captain Mike Tindall. The pair have a four-year-old daughter Mia as well as Lena. Mrs Tindall does not hold a royal title and is not an HRH but, as a descendant of the Queen, her pregnancies were announced publicly. After announcing that she had  lost her baby in 2016 she said she and her husband had been inundated with letters from people saying they had been through the same thing.  In a joint interview with her brother Peter Phillips, Mrs Tindall said: ""For me, the worst bit was that we had to tell everyone, everyone knew."" The 37-year-old went on: ""I had to go through having the baby because it was so far along.  ""I then had another miscarriage really early on."" Mrs Tindall praised her ""concerned"" husband and ""protective"" brother, saying: ""It was a time when my family came to the fore and I needed them."" Mrs Tindall said: ""In our case, it was something that was really rare; it was nature saying, 'This one's not right.'."" Mr Phillips explained how he and his wife Autumn and their two daughters live 200 yards from Mrs Tindall and her family.  He said: ""When Mia arrived it was quite difficult to compute. Zara has always been the little sister and suddenly I thought: 'Christ, you've properly grown up now'. ""That rather annoying little sister is now a well-respected equestrian and an exceptional mother. If my daughters come close to achieving what Zara's achieved, I'd be happy.""

The poor die younger. That bleak assessment is based on national data. Stockton-on-Tees is the town with England's biggest gap in life expectancy, according to Public Health England, and resident Rob Hill, who is only 46, is getting ready for his death.  A lifetime of cigarettes and poor food have taken their toll and Rob has numerous health problems including emphysema, lymphedema and type 2 diabetes. Two years ago he was given six months to live. Rob's on borrowed time. 'I've made a few bad choices,"" he told Panorama. ""Smoking - worst choice I could have ever made in my life."" He'll leave behind a partner and eight children - the youngest of whom play with him while he's hooked up to a machine that helps him breathe. 'Seeing my kids cry, that's horrible. It's not nice. Seeing them sitting there crying and listening to my children turn around and say 'my dad is going to die soon and I am not going to have him any more'."" Rob lives in a divided town.  In Stockton-on-Tees, those living in the wealthier areas can expect to live as much as 18 years longer than those in the more deprived parts of the town. It reflects a national problem. Nationally, on average, a boy born in one of the most affluent areas of England will outlive one born in one of the poorest parts by 8.4 years.  Dr David Hodges is a GP in the centre of Stockton, where the life expectancy for a man is 64. That's the same as Ethiopia. ""It's a disgrace. We need to be fixing this. People have the right to get to retirement age healthy. I will accept chronic illnesses, starting in your 60s, I don't accept as a society that we should be expecting people to be unwell in their 40s."" If you cannot view the life expectancy by neighbourhood figures, click to launch the interactive content. The reasons for the health inequality gap are complicated. Prof Clare Bambra, from Newcastle University, led a five-year study into health inequality in Stockton. She says there are many factors, but the main one is income. ""The poor are dying younger because they have less money in order to live a healthy life. They have more pressures on them, they have more insecurity and they have less control over their life."" Nationally, the government says it is committed to tackling health inequality and that it is taking action to help people live longer and healthier lives. In Stockton, health teams, the council and schools are all trying to make a difference.  Bernie Rizzi-Allan is the head of St Bede's Catholic Academy, which serves one of the town's most deprived areas. Results have improved since they introduced health therapies and counselling to help the children. ""People's health should not be defined by their social class,"" she said. ""It can change, and it will change. Our children have got just as much of an innate ability, potential and talent. If we don't recognise that, we're losing this resource. The country is losing so much potential."" But a walk around the cemetery shows the scale of the challenge, with gravestone after gravestone commemorating lives that ended too soon. Local undertaker Alison Crake said: ""You look, and you see somebody's age and you think that that's far too young. It goes beyond the initial grief of losing somebody you love and who is a key part of your family, because it reaches out into all the years that follow."" Back in the Hardwick area of Stockton, Rob is planning his funeral. He wants a short service to help his children deal with his death. But health inequality is brutal.

1807,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45003947,"Legal permission will no longer be needed to withdraw treatment from patients in permanent vegetative state, the Supreme Court has ruled. It will now be easier to withdraw food and liquid to allow such patients to die across the UK. When families and doctors are in agreement, medical staff will be able to remove feeding tubes without applying to the Court of Protection. Lady Black ruled there was no violation under the Human Rights Convention.  Relatives who have faced the court process in the past said the ruling would help families dealing with a ""tragic situation"". But anti-assisted dying campaigners said vegetative patients are ""effectively going to be starved and dehydrated to death"".  Previously the Court of Protection has ruled on cases but the process can take months or years, and it costs health authorities about ¬£50,000 in legal fees to lodge an appeal. The ruling could have an impact on the thousands of families whose loved ones are in a vegetative state.  There is estimated to be 1,500 new cases each year in England and Wales which would be affected, with about 3,000 of these patients alive at any one time.  The case was brought to the Supreme Court after a banker in his 50s suffered a heart attack, resulting in severe brain damage.  The man, known as Mr Y, was unresponsive after his heart attack last year and there was no chance of recovery. His family and his doctors agreed it would be in his best interests to allow him to die by withdrawing his feeding tube. The NHS trust asked the High Court to declare that it was not necessary to apply to the Court of Protection for a decision when the doctors and the family all believe it is in the patient's best interests. The judge agreed, but the official solicitor appealed on behalf of Mr Y - an appeal which has now been dismissed. Mr Y has since died but the case continued so that a court ruling could be made.  By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman For years -  so long as relatives agree, and it's in the best interests of a patient in a minimally conscious or vegetative state - doctors have been able to withdraw all sorts of treatment that will result in the end of someone's life.  These include, for instance, the withdrawal of life-saving dialysis. Doctors do not need the permission of a court to be able to do this. However, withdrawing food and water - the most basic requirements for life - has been handled differently. Since the case of Hillsborough survivor Anthony Bland in 1993, it has been regarded as a matter of practice that doctors must seek the approval of a court, even when they and relatives agree withdrawal would be in the best interests of the patient.  It has been treated as an exception, in part, perhaps, because of the emotional and psychological significance of the decision to remove sustenance from a person.  This has resulted, some experts believe, in individuals spending longer on life support in a vegetative state than was necessary because hospitals have shied away from going to court due to the expense and bureaucracy involved. Monday's ruling makes clear that courts need not be involved in these sorts of cases, so long as doctors and families are in agreement, and it is in the best interests of the patient.   However, the judgement cuts across ethical and religious beliefs and will divide opinion.   Some will see it as compassionate and humane, others the removing of a vital legal safeguard for a highly vulnerable group.  Author Cathy Rentzenbrink welcomed the ruling. Her brother Matty was severely brain damaged in a hit-and-run accident when he was 16 years old.  He spent eight years in a vegetative state, and she says her family had to go through a painful process of allowing the court to allow food and water to be withdrawn so he could die in 1998. Ms Rentzenbrink, who wrote a book about her experience, told the BBC: ""For families to be put through a court case, on top of everything else that has happened to them, is a struggle."" She said not having to face a court would help families already facing an ""incredibly difficult"" time. She said one of the ""difficult things"" about her experience in court was being made to swear an affidavit that she wanted her brother to die. ""I didn't want my brother to die. I wanted him to get better,"" she said.  ""I wanted him not to be knocked over in the first place - but I couldn't have any of those things."" She said: ""For all the families in this situation, they don't want to have to go to court and say they want someone to die."" The right to withdraw treatment from vegetative patients began in 1993 with Tony Bland, who had been in a vegetative state since 1989, until the House of Lords agreed that removing ""clinically assisted nutrition and hydration"" - where a patient is fed through tubes - did not constitute murder.  But they did say referring similar cases to the Court of Protection was best practice.  In Monday's Supreme Court judgement, Lady Black said an agreement between families and doctors was sufficient safeguarding to ensure ""public confidence"".  But she urged families to apply to court ""where there are differences of view"" between relatives or medical professionals. Source: NHS Choices Dr Peter Saunders, director of anti-assisted dying group Care Not Killing, said he was ""very concerned and quite disappointed by the Supreme Court ruling"" on ending care for vegetative patients, who are ""effectively going to be starved and dehydrated to death"". He said it removed an ""additional layer"" of protection for vulnerable, and ""financial concerns"" about looking after vegetative patients could mean ""decisions may be made for the wrong reasons"".  But the charity Compassion in Dying said it would ""allow those closest to a person - their loved ones and medical team - to feel supported and empowered to make the right decision for the person, even when it is a difficult one"".",,,,

There are concerns that some medical professionals in England are unable to get the help they need.  In 2017, 26-year-old junior doctor Sophie Spooner suffered a panic attack while working on a paediatrics ward. Twenty-four hours later, she had taken her own life. Her mother, Dr Laurel Spooner, believes her suicide was the result of depression which she had struggled with in the past. She had previously been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. ""She was looking for a mental health service that would have understood her mental health problem in the context of being a doctor,"" Dr Laurel Spooner told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme:  ""If she could have seen somebody‚Ä¶ and had the right medication, I expect she would still be here."" Figures from the Office for National Statistics, covering England, showed that between 2011 and 2015, 430 health professionals took their own lives. The NHS Practitioner Health Programme (PHP), is the only confidential service that offers doctors a range of assessments, treatment and case-management for all mental health problems.  But doctors can only self-refer to the PHP, without the need to tell their Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), if they work in London.  Others can access the service, but in telling their CCG they consequently lose their anonymity.  Its medical director, Dr Clare Gerada, says: ""Doctors are at an incredibly high risk for mental illness,"" she said. ""Female doctors have up to four times the risk of suicide in comparison to people in the [general] population."" In 10 years, the PHP has helped more than 5,000 doctors, of whom slightly over two-thirds were women. The average age has dropped from 51.6 years to 38.9. But doctors can only self-refer if they work in London.  Other doctors can access the service, but they must do so via their local clinical commissioning group (CCG), thereby losing their anonymity.

The BBC has details of more organisations that can offer support and information on emotional distress. In texts to her mother before she died, Sophie Spooner said she feared she would be sent into hospital if she revealed her mental health issues and her colleagues would find out. She also expressed her anger at not being able to access the PHP confidentially because she worked outside London. Dr Gerada says the lack of confidentiality is a barrier and wants NHS England to extend the London approach to any doctor who needs support. She believes acknowledging that doctors also have mental health problems is ""the last taboo in the NHS"". Louise Freeman, a consultant in emergency medicine, says she left her job after she felt she could not access appropriate support for her depression. ""On the surface you might think 'Oh, doctors will get great mental health care because they'll know who to go to'.  ""But actually we're kind of a hard-to-reach group. We can be quite worried about confidentiality,"" she said, adding that she believes doctors are afraid of coming forwards in case they lose their jobs. ""I was absolutely desperate to stay at work. I never wavered from that."" One of the biggest issues, according to Dr Gerada, is the effect on doctors of complaints from the public, which she says can ""shatter their sense of self"". Sophie Spooner's death came two months after a complaint was made against her. Nine months ago, consultant anaesthetist Richard Harding took his own life. A serious complaint had been made about him to the General Medical Council. He was eventually cleared but the process took five months. His wife Kate Harding, a GP, says it brought back depression he had not had for years.  ""Those five months just felt endless. Even after the complaint had been shelved, he was the type of person - afterwards - who questioned his decisions a lot more.  ""The effects are more long-lasting than you'd expect. I don't think it occurred to him to seek help."" Anna Rowland, assistant director of the GMC's fitness-to-practise department, said the organisation had made major reforms to its processes, with an emphasis on mental health, to ensure vulnerable doctors were identified and supported.  She said: ""We're committed to continuing this work, and we're also keen to influence the way wellbeing is approached by other healthcare leaders through independent research... health organisations must come together to tackle these important issues."" NHS England said in a statement: ""We launched the NHS GP Health service in 2017, a world-first, nationally funded confidential service which specialises in supporting GPs and trainee GPs experiencing mental ill health and which has already helped more than 1,500 GPs.   ""NHS Trusts and clinical commissioning groups may offer additional support for professionals in their area, for example CCGs in London have commissioned the NHS practitioner health programme for their staff.""

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-45381947,"Scientists have used artificial intelligence to predict how cancers will progress and evolve. This could help doctors design the most effective treatment for each patient. A team led by the Institute of Cancer Research London (ICR) and the University of Edinburgh developed a new technique known as Revolver (Repeated Evolution of Cancer). This picks out patterns in DNA mutation within cancers and uses the information to forecast future genetic changes. The researchers said the ever-changing nature of tumours was one of the biggest challenges in treating cancer - with cancers often evolving to a drug-resistant form. However, if doctors can predict how a tumour will evolve, they could intervene earlier to stop cancer in its tracks before it has had a chance to evolve or develop resistance, increasing the patient's chances of survival. The team also found a link between certain sequences of repeated tumour mutations and survival outcome. This suggests that repeating patterns of DNA mutations could be used as an indicator of prognosis, helping to shape future treatment. For example, researchers found that breast tumours which had a sequence of errors in the genetic material that codes for the tumour-suppressing protein p53, followed by mutations in chromosome 8, survived less time than those with other similar trajectories of genetic changes. The research team developed a new machine learning technique which transfers knowledge about tumours across similar patients. This method identifies patterns in the order that genetic mutations occur in tumours that are repeated both within and between patients' tumours, applying one tumour's pattern of mutations to predict another's. Researchers used 768 tumour samples from 178 patients reported in previous studies for lung, breast, kidney and bowel cancer, and analysed the data within each cancer type respectively to accurately detect and compare changes in each tumour. By identifying repeating patterns and combining this with current knowledge of cancer biology and evolution, scientists could predict the future trajectory of tumour development. If tumours with certain patterns are found to develop resistance to a particular treatment, this novel methodology could be used to predict if patients will develop resistance in the future. The research is published in the journal Nature Methods. Dr Andrea Sottoriva, who led the study and is team leader in evolutionary genomics and modelling at the ICR, said: ""We've developed a powerful artificial intelligence tool which can make predictions about the future steps in the evolution of tumours based on certain patterns of mutation that have so far remained hidden within complex data sets. ""With this tool we hope to remove one of cancer's trump cards - the fact that it evolves unpredictably, without us knowing what is going to happen next. ""By giving us a peek into the future, we could potentially use this AI tool to intervene at an earlier stage, predicting cancer's next move."" ICR chief executive Professor Paul Workman said: ""Cancer evolution is the biggest challenge we face in creating treatments that will work more effectively for patients. ""If we are able to predict how a tumour will evolve, the treatment could be altered before adaptation and drug resistance ever occur, putting us one step ahead of the cancer. ""This new approach using AI could allow treatment to be personalised in a more detailed way and at an earlier stage than is currently possible, tailoring it to the characteristics of each individual tumour and to predictions of what that tumour will look like in the future.""",,,,

The procedure, bronchial thermoplasty, ""melts"" away excess muscle tissue in the lungs using radio frequency, making breathing easier. Previously there were strict criteria about who was eligible to receive it. But the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) says it can be offered more routinely, after it was proved to be safe and effective. Some people may still not be able to receive it because the final decision about whether to offer the procedure lies with local health bodies. Some 5.4 million people in the UK have asthma - but for more than 200,000 of them (3.7%) the asthma is so severe, it can be life-threatening. In fact, the most recent figures from Asthma UK show that 1,410 people died from asthma in 2016.  However, this ""life-changing"" treatment will be used only if a patient's symptoms cannot be adequately controlled with drugs, and is only suitable for adults. Joe Farrington-Douglas, the charity's head of policy and external affairs, said: ""This debilitating form of asthma is resistant to regular treatments, meaning many have to cope with terrifying asthma symptoms, such as gasping for breath, as well repeated trips to Accident & Emergency.  ""Until now, this treatment has only been available for specific patients at some specialist centres, but these new guidelines could mean more people with the condition could reap the benefits."" They might only happen when you react to a trigger, like pollen, dust, cigarette smoke, cold air or pets. Source: Asthma UK Severe asthma causes inflammation and constriction of the smooth muscle in the walls of the small tubes - the bronchi - impeding the passage of air through to the deep tissue of the lungs. Bronchial thermoplasty tackles this by reducing this muscle mass, thus decreasing the constriction of the bronchi that can take place during an asthma attack.  As a result, patients experience fewer and less severe asthma attacks. The procedure takes place under sedation or general anaesthetic and involves a wire probe being inserted into the lungs. Ten-second bursts of radio waves are sent along the airway wall, heating the lining of the lungs to 65C. Two further sessions will be needed, each three weeks apart.  The estimated cost of the procedure per patient is thought to be between ¬£7,099 and ¬£7,257. Nice's programme director and clinical adviser, Prof Kevin Harris, said: ""This is a procedure which is innovative and it does work. ""Asthma is a common disease and the vast majority of patients won't require this treatment.  ""But for people with severe asthma this procedure could be life-changing.

Why is this procedure increasingly popular and is it more dangerous to have the operation abroad? Leah Cambridge, from Leeds, suffered a massive pulmonary embolism during the operation at a private hospital in Izmir in 2018, a coroner found. The 29-year-old beautician was undergoing a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) where fat from the stomach is injected into the buttocks. Ms Cambridge had opted for surgery abroad - which is often cheaper than in the UK - after growing paranoid about excess stomach fat after having children, her partner Mr Franks said. Her neighbours have described her as ""absolutely stunning"", adding that they believed she had gone to have the treatment against her partner's wishes. And Ms Cambridge is not the first British woman whose quest for the perfect behind ended in tragedy abroad. Joy Williams underwent buttock augmentation surgery in Bangkok, Thailand, in October 2014. Her wounds became infected, and the 24-year-old, from London, died under anaesthetic. Three years previously, 20-year-old Claudia Aderotimi, from Hackney, east London, died as a result of a botched ""buttock enhancement"" procedure at a US hotel.  The BBL procedure is not considered to be any more dangerous than many other types of cosmetic surgery, according to consultant plastic surgeon Bryan Mayou. ""The danger is the surgery being performed by unqualified surgeons outside a clinical setting without appropriate aftercare,"" says Mr Mayou, a member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. ""If fat is injected deep into muscle tissue and lower down on the buttocks, there is a risk of incorrectly injecting fat into large veins. ""The fat, now an embolus, can pass around the bloodstream, into the lungs and cause death."" Mr Franks, 31, told The Sun: ""Leah was under anaesthetic and complications happened due to fat getting deposited in her bloodstream and her oxygen levels fell. ""She was brought back to stable but had three heart attacks and there was nothing they could do."" Plastic surgeons from international societies have set up a taskforce to monitor and report on the BBL procedure, says Mr Mayou. The death rate following the procedure was found to be 1 in 3,000 and all the fatal cases investigated featured fat emboli being found in the buttock muscle, he says. The surgeon says he has noticed a rise in the number of bottom-boosting operations at his Cadogan Clinic in Chelsea, west London, in the past four years. ""It's a current fad,"" he explains. ""Years ago everyone wanted to be smaller and they would be saying 'can we have liposuction to make [my bottom] smaller?'"" And that is the technique that would be used if the ""bubble butt"" goes out of fashion and BBL patients want the procedure reversed, he says. So why the obsession with having a bigger behind? For Mr Mayou, it's down to popular culture celebrating curvier physiques. ""We live in an ethnically diverse world and there is an appreciation of different body shapes from our own, and then these techniques become available that make these shapes achievable."" Celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Cardi B have huge followings on social media where they regularly post photographs flaunting their rounded posteriors.  Jenner posted a video on her blog in which she attributed her curves to weight gain: ""[I haven't had] ass implants. You know, I used to be 120 [lbs]. I was really skinny. Now I'm pushing like 136. But it's alright, I like the chunkiness."" However, Cardi B has revealed that before she broke on to the music scene she had filler injected into her buttocks in a basement in New York - and the silicone leaked for five days afterwards. In an interview with GQ, she said she paid $800 (¬£564) for the procedure after seeing her stripper colleagues with bigger bottoms earning more than her. Chloe Simms, a star of reality soap The Only Way Is Essex, has been open about the bum-boosting cosmetic surgery she's had, having complained on the show that she had ""the flattest bum in Essex"". This Instagram post from 2013 shows her slim silhouette.   While she appears much more curvaceous in this swimwear shot from July 2018. And as Mr Mayou points out, BBL surgery can be a particularly attractive idea for some women as it's seen as being able to solve two body hang-ups in one go. ""For a lot of people you are really getting two benefits from one operation - removing fat from somewhere they don't want it and putting it somewhere they do,"" he says. In terms of cost, cosmetic surgery is cheaper in countries like Turkey than in the UK, Mr Mayou says.  He estimates a BBL procedure would cost about ¬£8,000 in the UK. Some reports state Ms Cambridge paid as little as ¬£3,000 for her surgery.

They predict about 80% of heart attacks and strokes in people under 75 could be prevented if heart health was improved. Unhealthy lifestyles put four in five adults at risk of early death, they estimate. People should quit smoking, eat a healthy diet and get enough exercise. The test is not diagnostic - it will not tell you whether you are going to have a heart attack - but it can be a wake-up call to make healthy changes. David Green, who is 59, took the test.   ""The worst moment was being told my heart is 10 years older than me and that my life expectancy was shortened,"" he told the BBC.  ""That took some digesting for sure, but I flipped it to a positive statement to do something to reverse that scenario.""  David took the test after he struggled to keep up with rehearsals for his role in The Full Monty with his local theatre company in Plymouth.  He had never heard of heart age, but said he would have guessed he was only a few years off.  ""I'm 59 now so I thought 'oh maybe it'll be 62 or 63', so a whole 10 years - that was a real shocker. ""They told me that 'you really need to do something otherwise you're not going to see that much of your pension'.  ""I think that was the main thing for me, I'd just retired, I'd like to live a bit longer thank you very much.""  Obesity, poor diet, a lack of exercise and high blood pressure are significant risk factors for the heart that can be changed. Source: NHS Choices Almost two million people have taken the heart age test and 78% of participants have a heart age higher than their actual age, putting them at greater risk of an early death. Of those, 34% were more than five years over their actual age and 14% at least 10 years higher. More than 84,000 people die from a heart attack or stroke each year in England.  Dr Matt Kearney, from NHS England, said the test has the ""potential to help millions of people"". The test is being backed by the British Heart Foundation and the Stroke Association. Juliet Bouverie, chief executive at the Stroke Association, said: ""We believe that across the UK there are around six million people who are undiagnosed and untreated for high blood pressure or atrial fibrillation, two of the biggest risk factors for stroke.  ""However, treatment for these conditions can significantly reduce your risk of stroke and the devastation it causes.""  The test asks 16 simple physical and lifestyle questions and gives an estimation of your heart age, and a prediction of the risk of having a heart attack or stroke by a certain age.  It also gives suggestions on lifestyle changes to help people reduce their heart age.   David joined the gym, cut down on his alcohol intake and is eating much more healthily. He says taking control of his health and knowing what he's dealing with is very satisfying and empowering.   So far David has lost two stone and his BMI has come down by six points. ""I want to have a long and happy and healthy retirement and that's what it's about now - I've worked for 40 years continuously and I want to be enjoying things, I don't want to be hobbling around on a stick, which I could have easily been doing by now.  ""I know when I've had those temptations to have an extra pint of beer or glass of wine I know I've got to do something about that as a forfeit - it's good, it's an empowering thing to do.""  Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at British Heart Foundation, said: ""The goal of the Heart Age Tool is not to diagnose any heart conditions but to make people more aware of risks to their heart health and give them the incentive to make simple lifestyle changes.   ""If you are concerned about your heart age, you should speak to your GP.""",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45394620,"Doctors are being told to adopt a new policy of writing letters that are easier for patients to understand.  The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges says too often correspondence contains complex medical jargon rather than plain and simple English.  Using the phrase ""twice daily"" to explain the dosing of a medicine is better than the Latin abbreviation ""bd"", for example. Patients should ask their local hospital to comply, the academy says. The Please Write to Me initiative is aimed mainly at doctors working in outpatient clinics, although it is best practice for all clinicians who need to write clinical letters.  Doctors are being asked to write directly to patients, rather than sending them a copy of a letter penned to their GP.  The academy says this should help avoid blunders or offence caused by writing about patients in the third person.  It cites the example of a surgeon branded sexist after praising a father for ""manfully stepping in"" to take his daughter to a hospital appointment when his wife was too ill.  Another consideration is the tone of the letter. A familiar style, such as: ""It was a pleasure to meet you and your husband for the first time,"" might sometimes be appropriate - but at other times a more distant or formal style might be appreciated, say the guidelines.  Doctors are asked to avoid potentially stigmatising words: ""'You have diabetes,' is better than 'You are diabetic.'"" They should think about softening the impact of potentially sensitive information by using a more non-committal style, as with: ""During the examination, the tremor and stiffness in your right arm suggest that you have Parkinson's disease."" And any medical words should be translated in plain English. For example: Hospital doctors should also consider telephoning the patients rather than breaking bad news in the letter if test results are potentially upsetting, the academy says. The initiative is being led by Dr Hugh Rayner, a kidney specialist, who first started writing directly to patients in 2005.  He said: ""The change may seem small but it has a big effect.  ""Writing to patients rather than about them changes the relationship between doctor and patient.  ""It involves them more in their care and leads to all sorts of benefits.  ""Millions of clinic letters are written every month in the NHS so this change could have a big impact."" The Royal College of GPs is also on board. Vice-chair Prof Kamila Hawthorne said: ""I have seen a number of patients who have asked me to 'translate' the letter they have received from the hospital, which has been little more than a medical summary. ""By hospital doctors writing any letters directly to patients, with their GP copied in so we are always aware of what is happening regarding our patient's care, it should make the process more patient-centred, and make them feel more involved in their care, which will be beneficial for everyone.""",,,,

They're sitting in the sunshine of the memorial garden at the hospice where Abigail spent many happy hours.  Ty Hafan's children's hospice, just along the coast from Barry Island in south Wales, holds a special place in their hearts. And now, as part of a remarkable new sound installation, the names of more than 300 children who were cared for there will be celebrated in the form of birdsong.   Abigail had mucolipidosis type 2, an extremely rare, life-limiting disorder and died at the hospice when she was 10. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, her mum, Pauline Harvey, says: ""Ty Hafan was the only place we could be together as a family, outside of our home and the hospital, because Abigail had such a severe disability."" The hospice has always remembered children who have died by painting a pebble with their name on it, but now they are using Morse code and birdsong to do something special for hundreds of families. ""We knew from the parents that hearing their child's name is very, very important, so we found a really creative way to link those children's names into a very natural feeling of the birdsong in the environment,"" Tracy Jones, head of community services and partnerships, explains. The hospice is working with sound artist Justin Wiggan, who takes the name of the child, puts it into a Morse code translator and then samples birdsong around it. Justin says it's been an emotional process. ""I don't think you can create work like this without being connected with the people and families - I am a father myself so I can identify with some of the age ranges. The first few times it is quite overwhelming."" He has a detailed way of choosing which bird should sing each child's name. ""I started to look at a calendar that I found in an old book in a charity shop, showing which birds sing the strongest during the month that the child died. ""From talking to parents and just seeing how at times the child was a lot stronger than the parents, this carried through to a concept that the bird chosen for the child should be the one that sings the strongest during the month that the child died.""  And he has what he admits is a romantic hope that wild birds in the garden will, in time, mimic the sounds. Pauline says Abigail would have been delighted with the concept. ""She was so happy, and such a big personality that she would love the idea of having her name sung across the skies - she would absolutely have adored that idea."" Abigail's name has been turned into the birdsong of a robin, which Pauline says is very appropriate. ""The robin is one of her favourite birds, such a lively, stroppy, opinionated little bird, it's very emotional."" And hearing it played out in the garden for the first time? She takes a deep breath, then smiles. ""It sort of knocked me off my feet a little bit. I think what I'm hit with is a wall of memories."" Abigail's dad Stephen agrees. ""It's a fairly small bird, and Abigail was small for her age, she was probably the size of a two-year-old. She was extremely feisty, it just brings a lot of emotions and thoughts back."" Abigail's sister Jennifer, 11, was seven when her sister died. ""It's one of those birds that will not be forgotten, you will always know what it is, and Abigail will not be forgotten at any time."" The Harvey family will also be playing out the recording on a speaker in their own garden.  For Jennifer, having the birdsong at home will be a comfort. ""When I wake up in the morning and go outside. Just to hear that, that would cheer me up a lot."" Abigail's story was featured on 5 Live's Anna Foster programme which is broadcast from Monday to Thursday from 10:00-13:00 BST and is available on iPlayer afterwards.",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45408017,"Very little progress has been made in reducing levels of inactivity worldwide, experts have warned. A WHO report estimates that more than a quarter of people worldwide - 1.4 billion - are not doing enough physical exercise, a figure that has barely improved since 2001. Inactivity raises the risk of a raft of health problems, such as heart disease, type-2 diabetes and some cancers. High-income countries, including the UK, were among the least active. And women were found to be more sedentary throughout the world, with the exception of two regions of Asia.  Researchers from the World Health Organization (WHO) looked at self-reported data on activity from 358 population-based surveys in 168 countries, including 1.9 million people, for their study in The Lancet Global Health. They found in high-income countries, which include the UK and the USA, the proportion of inactive people had risen from 32% in 2001 to 37% in 2016, while in low-income countries it had remained stable at 16%. Those who were classed as inactive did less than 150 minutes of moderate exercise - or 75 minutes at a vigorous intensity - a week. Countries driving the upwards trend included Germany, New Zealand and the US. Women were less active than men in all but East and South-East Asia, with the biggest differences being in South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, north Africa and high-income Western countries. The authors said this was likely to have been caused by a combination of factors, including extra childcare duties and cultural attitudes that made it harder for them to exercise. In the UK, inactivity levels in 2016 were 36% overall - 32% of men and 40% of women. Experts said the transition in wealthier countries towards more sedentary jobs and hobbies, along with increased use of motor transport, might explain their higher levels of inactivity.  In lower-income countries people are more likely to be active in their jobs and walk or use public transport. The report's authors warned that as things stood the WHO's 2025 target of reducing global inactivity by 10% would be missed. Dr Regina Guthold, lead author of the study from the WHO, said: ""Unlike other major global health risks, levels of insufficient physical activity are not falling worldwide, on average, and over a quarter of all adults are not reaching the recommended levels of physical activity for good health. ""Regions with increasing levels of insufficient physical activity are a major concern for public health and the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases."" Co-author Dr Fiona Bull, also from the WHO, said: ""Addressing these inequalities in physical activity levels between men and women will be critical to achieving global activity targets and will require interventions to promote and improve women's access to opportunities that are safe, affordable and culturally acceptable.""

Dr Melody Ding, from the University of Sydney, who was not involved in the study, said that while economic development led to lifestyle changes that increased sedentary behaviour, governments could do more to help people be more active, such as improving public transport and making it easier to walk and cycle.  Dr Mike Brannan, national lead for physical activity at Public Health England, said: ""These figures highlight the global issue of inactivity and the UK is no exception.

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45409471,"There has been an explosion in interest in veganism, in recent years, driven largely by concerns about health, animal welfare and the environment.   Vegans, for the uninitiated, do not eat meat, poultry, fish, or any products derived from animals, including eggs, dairy products, and gelatin. There are now four times as many vegans in the UK as there were four years ago.  So how hard is it to convert, and what are the potential health benefits? Veganism: Why is it on the up? Why I gave up being vegan Going vegan: Is it just a fad? What does a healthy vegan diet look like? For the latest series of Trust Me I'm A Doctor, Dr Giles Yeo decided to try it for a month and see if it was a lifestyle he could imagine adopting.  As Dr Yeo quickly discovered, one of the tricky things about going vegan is that many products that don't sound as if they have anything to do with animals actually do.  Eggs, cheese and meat are obvious no-nos but so is mayonnaise (contains eggs), some pastas (ditto), and wine (some alcoholic drinks use fish bones or proteins from other animals as part of the production process).  As well as making sure you are not accidentally consuming animal products, one of the main challenges of going vegan is to make sure you're not missing out on any key nutrients. Following a vegan diet puts you at risk of getting insufficient vitamin D, which is needed for bone health.  To get this through diet, vegans may need to rely on fortified foods, including some types of soy milk, rice milk, organic orange juice, and breakfast cereals.   You may also want to consider taking a vitamin D supplement. Iodine deficiency is very common in the UK, particularly among young women.  Cow's milk is our main source of iodine and non-dairy alternatives, such as almond milk, have much lower levels. You can get iodine from seaweed (though the amounts are unpredictable) but you will probably need to take a supplement. The other big concern is getting enough vitamin B12. You won't find it in seeds, nuts or vegetables, so vegans and vegetarians will need to stock up with fortified breakfast cereal or nutritional yeast. Will going vegan make you healthier? A recent analysis, which pulled together the results of 10 previous studies comparing the health of vegetarian and vegans against that of omnivores, suggests it will. The researchers found being a vegetarian or vegan was associated with a significantly lower risk of heart disease and cancer, though there was no difference in all-cause mortality.  In other words, being a vegetarian or vegan was associated with being healthier but not necessarily with living longer.  I say ""associated with"" because these were not the gold standard randomised controlled studies, where you take a large group of people and randomly allocate them to being vegan or omnivorous and see what happens. Such studies would be very hard to do. Instead, they compare people who are vegans with meat eaters and look for differences.  Since vegans are likely to be more health conscious than the general population, it is possible that the health differences have nothing to do with the diet itself.   So how did Dr Yeo get on? After being vegan for a month he had lost 4kg and brought in his belt by a notch. Along with the fall in his belly fat, his cholesterol also fell by 12%.  So will he keep it up? ""I've been pleasantly surprised,"" he said, ""and though I don't plan to go vegan entirely, from now on I'll try and do at least a few days every month. ""I have to admit I was apprehensive about going vegan for a month, but once I learned a few recipes I was fine and I actually ended up enjoying it.  For me, the key was not to cook vegan versions of meals that I would normally eat with meat, but to opt for recipes that were designed to be vegan in the first place.   ""What I missed most while on the diet was eggs - I actually expected to miss meat a lot more.""

Some big chains like McDonalds and Wetherspoons already print the calories of dishes on their menus. The Department of Health wants to make it a legal requirement as part of its childhood obesity strategy. But the Treasury has said small independent cafes and restaurants should be exempt from the move. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss has said the policy would be a burden on 26,000 small businesses and could lead to job cuts. The Treasury estimates that working out the precise calorie count of individual dishes could cost up to ¬£500 and menus would have to be reprinted when recipes changed, adding further costs. The Federation of Small Businesses said it would like to see more flexibility for its members in recognition of the fact that smaller operators would find it much harder to absorb the costs involved.  ""Businesses will have to spend hundreds to work out a precise calorie count and when recipes change, which could well incur additional costs unless regulations are written with small business in mind,"" said the organisation's chairman Mike Cherry. The Department of Health and Social Care is set to launch a consultation on the plans and has said exempting small restaurants will be considered as part of that. A spokesman for the department said: ""The government announced its intention to consult on mandatory calorie labelling on menus as part of the second chapter of the childhood obesity plan in July and we will set out our next steps in due course."" Ms Truss has written to Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, Theresa May's de facto second-in-command, to express her concerns.  In the letter, leaked to The Daily Telegraph, she says: ""At this stage I am not agreeing to any preferred or final policy change for small or micro businesses. ""We should take a final decision following this consultation and informed by the evidence submitted to it. ""HM Treasury clearance is required for government's response to this consultation."" Ministers have also been warned that requiring restaurants to include calorie counts on menus could cause added distress to people with eating disorders. Beat, a charity that supports people with eating disorders, said research indicated the number of calories someone consumed was not a reliable indicator of their health.   ""Evidence shows that calorie labelling exacerbates eating disorders of all kinds,"" said the organisation's chief executive, Andrew Radford.  ""Public health campaigns need to consider people's mental health as well as their physical health.  ""They must move away from obesity shaming to emphasising healthy behavioural changes and instilling confidence into people.""",,,,

Their study is among the most detailed analyses of what happens when we consume probiotics.  They are seen as healthy and good for the gut, but the results found they had little or no effect inside the body.  The researchers said probiotics of the future would need tailoring to the needs of each individual.  The team at the Weizmann Institute of Science made their own probiotic cocktail using 11 common good bacteria including strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. It was given to 25 healthy volunteers for a month. They were then sedated and samples were surgically taken from multiple places in the stomach and small and large intestines.  The researchers were looking to see where bacteria successfully colonised and whether they led to any changes in the activity of the gut.  The results in the journal Cell, showed in half of cases the good bacteria went in the mouth and straight out the other end.  In the rest, they lingered briefly before being crowded out by our existing microbes.

He told the BBC: ""And in that sense just buying probiotics at the supermarket without any tailoring, without any adjustment to the host, at least in part of the population, is quite useless."" The research group also looked at the impact of probiotics after a course of antibiotics, which wipe out both good and bad bacteria.  Their trial on 46 people, also in the journal Cell, showed it led to delays in the normal healthy bacteria re-establishing themselves.  Dr Elinav added: ""Contrary to the current dogma that probiotics are harmless and benefit everyone, these results reveal a new potential adverse side effect of probiotic use with antibiotics that might even bring long-term consequences."" There have been some proven benefits of probiotics, notably in protecting premature babies from necrotising enterocolitis. And there remains great hope within science that understanding the complex relationship between the microbial and human parts of our body will lead to new treatments.  However, Dr Trevor Lawley, a microbiome researcher at the Sanger Institute, said he was not surprised by the findings.  He told the BBC: ""Probiotics have been around for a long time and they're coming under more scrutiny. ""These are very innovative studies, but they are preliminary findings that need replicating.

Middle-aged drinkers are more likely than any other age group to drink more than the recommended 14 units a week.  A YouGov poll also suggests they find cutting back on alcohol far harder than eating healthily or exercising. Doctors say ""drink-free"" days will improve sleep, help with weight loss and reduce the risk of high blood pressure and cancer. Dr Julia Verne, a spokeswoman on liver disease for Public Health England, said: ""Having a day off drinking gives you a chance to clean your system and give your liver a rest.  ""It also has an immediate impact on your sleep and calorie consumption.  ""People have also told us that the idea of a 'drink-free' day is much easier to manage than cutting down, say, from one large glass of wine to a small glass of wine.""  The campaign, Drink Free Days, is a partnership between Public Health England and the alcohol education charity Drinkaware.  The YouGov poll - by PHE and Drinkaware - surveyed nearly 9,000 18- to 85-year-olds during May and June this year.  It found that one in five was drinking more than the government's 14 unit-a-week guidelines. And two-thirds said they would find cutting down on their drinking harder to do than improving their diet, exercising more or reducing their smoking.  Dr Verne said: ""Most middle-aged people are not drinking to become drunk.  ""They see it as a social activity, or as a reward for success or compensation for a hard day at work.  ""It's become a habit and part of their lives.  ""But the more you drink, the more you increase your risk of high blood pressure, heart and liver disease and cancer.   ""Ultimately you are more likely to cut down if you have some days off drinking.""  She also pointed out that many people in this demographic were struggling with their weight and didn't realise how many calories were contained in alcohol.  In 2016, the government cut the alcohol limits it recommended for men and women to 14 units a week - six pints of average-strength beer or seven glasses of wine.

For men, being told you are infertile can be a crushing and lonely experience. Male infertility is now the most common reason for couples in the UK to seek IVF - but when Craig Franklin was told bluntly that he had no sperm, he felt alone and emasculated.

This has led to an ""absurd"" case, says Prof Lewis, where women routinely have to undergo IVF - even if there is nothing wrong with their own fertility. ""The woman actually acts as the therapy for the man's problem [of poor sperm],"" she says. ""We are giving an invasive procedure to a person who doesn't need it, in order to treat another person. That doesn't happen in any other branch of medicine."" Prof Lewis adds that it is also a ""huge expense for the NHS"", at a time when IVF is being rationed in many parts of the country. One couple, who spoke to the Victoria Derbyshire programme anonymously, might never have had their son had they not explored other options privately. On the NHS, they were given a round of IVF - despite the female partner having good fertility - but it failed due to the man's poor sperm. ""It was really unpleasant. Injecting yourself with needles that don't go in the first time is not a walk in the park,"" she explains. So instead, the man sought the help of a private clinic and had an operation - cheaper than a round of IVF - to treat varicocele, an abnormality in the scrotum that affects up to 40% of men with fertility problems. His wife conceived naturally. For Stephen Harbottle, a consultant clinical scientist who helped develop the fertility guidelines for health watchdog NICE, while varicocele treatment will not work for every man, the NHS must ensure other options are explored before IVF is offered to a couple. This includes simple solutions such as dietary supplements, or tests to check for sperm DNA damage. The reason this does not happen currently, he says, is that ""doctors don't have any other options available other than to refer patients for IVF"". ""Men in some ways are just being farmed through the system,"" he adds. Some men with fertility problems also report feeling sidelined by GPs, who they say focus on the women. Mark Harper - from Ilkeston in Derbyshire - has two children through donor sperm. But when he was originally found to have no sperm, it was his wife whom the doctor called with the news rather than him.  ""If you're talking to a male about his infertility problems, you ought to be talking to the male about it,"" he says. ""I'm here, I'm a person, I was the one sitting in front of you, and I'm the one you need to be talking to."" The Royal College of GPs said in a statement that its members were ""highly trained to have sensitive, non-judgemental conversations with all our patients... including why someone might have problems with their fertility and the best options for them going forward"". Prof Sheena Lewis says the lack of attention on male fertility also means men are not educated on their reproductive health, and may wrongly take it for granted. ""Men do have a biological clock. As time goes on, because of their lifestyle, there are more and more opportunities for mutations to occur in their sperm. ""Men who are over 45 when they have children are more likely to have children who will have childhood cancers, or may have psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder or autism,"" she says, adding that she believes this is also likely to be the case for younger men with poor sperm quality. Katie and Craig say doctors presumed the reason they were not able to conceive was because of Katie - and she was tested before Craig's fertility was ever considered. The couple are now looking for donor sperm privately, having been denied IVF on the NHS. The stigma surrounding male infertility means this is the first time Craig has ever spoken openly about the issue - until now, even his friends did not know. ""It's not a manly thing to discuss,"" he says. ""It's boxed up... and not spoken about."" The couple say it took them a year-and-a-half to come to terms with not being able to have children without donor sperm - made worse by the fact emotional support was never offered to them. But now they are coming through it. ""We're stronger than ever,"" Katie says. ""But other couples might not be as strong as us. They might not be able to work through that and I can see why - it's so hard for the man to be able to come to terms with not being able to give his wife a child.""

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45474408,"Tanzania's President John Magufuli has urged women to stop taking birth control pills, saying the country needs more people.  ""Women can now give up contraceptive methods,"" Mr Magufuli said.  Opposition MP Cecil Mwambe has criticised the comments, saying they contradicted the country's health policy. Tanzania has a population of around 53 million people, with 49% of them living on less than $2 (¬£1.50) a day. On average, a woman in Tanzania has more than five children, among the highest rates in the world. The day after Mr Magufuli's comments, speaker of parliament Job Ndugai banned female lawmakers from wearing fake nails and eye-lashes in parliament. Mr Ndugai told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that the ban was because of ""health"" reasons, without elaborating. The new regulations also ban women MPs from wearing short dresses and jeans. Female visitors to parliament will also be expected to adhere to the dress code. Mr Magufuli made his comments at a rally on Sunday in the northern Meatu district, saying people who use family planning methods were lazy, the local Citizen newspaper quoted him as saying.  ""They do not want to work hard to feed a large family. And that is why they opt for births controls and end up with one or two children only,"" he said. ""I have travelled to Europe and elsewhere and have seen the harmful effects of birth control. Some countries are now facing declining population growth."" Mr Mwambe said that if President Magufuli wanted his comments to be taken seriously, he should change the health insurance scheme to cover 10 children instead of the current four per family, the Citizen reports. The paper however said that there was no indication that the country's population policy would change following the remarks. Mr Magufuli made similar comments in 2016. After the launch of free primary and secondary education, he said: ""Women can now throw away their contraceptives. Education is now free.""  He has proposed several controversial policies since he was elected in 2015.  Last year he proposed that pregnant schoolgirls be blocked from resuming their education after giving birth.",,,,

Only half of those who had experienced problems with stress, anxiety or low mood had talked to their employer about it.  That's something that must change, says Mind.  Fear, shame and job insecurity are some of the reasons people may choose to hide their worries. Natalie Hunt, 34, from Salford, got her first job at 18. That role was working in a department store, serving customers, but she found it extremely stressful.  ""It was dealing with complaints and helping people with queries. I'd had anxiety and depression as a teenager and the full-time job made me really anxious. I began to get shy and withdrawn, going more and more into myself, and I was worried about having a panic attack at work. ""Colleagues started to notice and eventually my boss wanted a word."" Natalie says that at the time, her employer didn't really understand or know what to do. There was no support. She then left the workplace altogether and took up an art course at college.  She now teaches art classes to people with mental health problems, and at a homeless shelter. She also works part-time in an office, even though sometimes she can go through stages of poor mental health.  Natalie says it makes a huge difference when the workplace is supportive - they have flexible hours and regular catch-ups. ""I first started back in the workplace with a bit of voluntary work in a charity shop, which was great. Because it was voluntary and part-time, I didn't feel pressured and it helped me regain some confidence. That was when I was 20.  ""Now I run my own art classes for people with mental health conditions. It's lovely to be making a difference."" Mind says around 300,000 people lose their job each year due to a mental health problem. The charity - along with The Royal Foundation, Heads Together and 11 other organisations - has created an online resource for employers and employees with information, advice, resources and training that workplaces can use to improve wellbeing.  A recent poll by the Institute of Directors found less than one in five firms offered mental health training for managers.  Poor relationships with line managers, along with workload, have the biggest negative impact on employees' mental health, the survey found - closely followed by poor relationships with colleagues.",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45477930,"The number of people suffering from hunger has increased during the past three years, after years of decline, a UN report suggests. According to the analysis, 821 million people globally were undernourished in 2017 - about one person in every nine. And nearly 151 million under-fives - 22% of the global total - have their growth stunted by poor nutrition.  The authors say extreme climate events are partly to blame for the rise and call for urgent global action. The report, The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, also says difficulties accessing nutritious food is contributing to the growing problem of obesity in the world, with one in eight adults  - more than 672 million - being classified as obese.  The authors note the frequency of extreme climate events - floods, heat, storms and droughts - has doubled since the early 1990s.  And they say: ""The report sends a clear message that climate variability and exposure to more complex, frequent and intense climate extremes are threatening to erode and even reverse the gains made in ending hunger and malnutrition."" Climate extremes have a direct impact on crop yields and food availability but can also reduce: And hunger is significantly worse in countries where agricultural systems are sensitive to variations in rainfall and temperature and where many people depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.  The authors say: ""Climate variability and extremes - in addition to conflict and violence in this part of the world - are a key driver behind the recent rises in global hunger and one of the leading causes of severe food crises."" And they call for coordinated global and local action so countries become more resilient to climate-related disasters.  Commenting on the report, Robin Willoughby, from Oxfam, said: ""It is shocking that after a prolonged decline, this is the third consecutive year of rising hunger.  ""The inescapable fact is that climate change is now leaving people around the world without enough to eat. ""Hunger is significantly worse in countries hit by severe droughts and flooding. A hotter world is proving to be a hungrier world.  ""The people behind these stark statistics need urgent help. Our political leaders must redouble efforts to cut the use of fossil fuels and commit funds to help poor countries adapt to climate crises.""

Dr Liz O'Riordan, 43, a breast cancer surgeon at Ipswich Hospital, has twice been diagnosed with the condition. The statue, revealed in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, depicts her after her mastectomy, with a cycling helmet and triathlon medal covering her chest. She said: ""I was a bit scared of being topless, but I'm really proud of showing the world my scars."" Dr O'Riordan was diagnosed with cancer in 2015 and 2018, and went to her final radiotherapy session at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge dressed as superhero Mrs Incredible. She has had the all-clear and said she has had one breast ""flattened"" and, on Friday as the final part of her treatment, had her ovaries removed at the West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds. Two days later, she was at town's Abbey Gardens to show off the statue, which has now been put back in storage. She said: ""Cancer is not a dirty secret, but we shouldn't be ashamed of our scars and I want to share the bad and the good - it's who we are."" The statue is one of 25 created by Non Zero One - a company which aimed to plug the gap in what it said was a lack of statues in the UK of women who are not royal, mythical or dead. Cat Harrison, lead artist, said ""bold and brave"" Dr O'Riordan was selected from hundreds of nominations for her ""complete honesty and cracking sense of humour"".

More than 130 public figures have signed a letter calling for a more responsible tone.  Part of the letter urges reporting to avoid detailed descriptions of suicide methods. The letter, released on World Suicide Prevention Day, has been backed by mental health charities and high-profile figures like Stephen Fry.  In 2015, comedy writer Jack Rooke found out how his friend Olly killed himself by reading the details online.  ""It was just placed there - right in the middle of this online copy - and it was just horrendous,"" Jack tells Newsbeat. He's now an ambassador for the mental health charity, The Campaign Against Living Miserably. ""It's a really brutal, cruel thing for anybody to have to have gone through. ""It was just a journalist who was trying to gather all these details, all these bits of information, in a really speculative and unhelpful way to create a bit of content that for me - and a lot of other people - was a really traumatic experience to go through."" Jack has gone on to work in the media, but says the experience stuck with him. ""We need to have a media which is far more ethical and actual doesn't sensationalise or, in the worst case scenario, glamourise young suicide,"" he says. The charity Samaritans has a set of reporting guidelines for the media when reporting suicide. These specifically ask journalists to think about the effect of the reporting on audiences - and warn against going into details like the ones Jack read.  A number of studies have shown such reporting can lead to copycat deaths, especially among young people. ""It's unfair that just by googling my friend's name to look at his old blog or website, I'm faced with an article where the methodology is excessively written about,"" says Jack. There were almost 6,000 suicides in the UK last year. Jack says the media needs to change for the sake of young people who struggle with these issues. ""This is a cultural thing which needs to change regardless of politics, regardless of what kind of news outlet you are.  ""This is something that is about our society and how we function when tragedy happens. We need to be more sensitive.  ""We need to help people who are going through it to recover.""

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45470820,"England is facing changing health demands due to an ageing population and the NHS must quickly adapt, says Public Health England.  It has compiled what it calls ""the most comprehensive picture"" of the nation's current health and future fitness.  It shows England's population is growing in size and people are living longer but not all in good health. While smoking rates may be decreasing, diabetes, obesity, dementia and mental health issues are on the rise. The Health Profile for England report shows average life expectancy has reached 79.6 years for men and 83.2 for women. In 2017, there were 1.35 million people aged 85 and over in England - nearly three times more than in 1971. By 2031, it could exceed two million, says Public Health England. But the number of years that people live in poor health is also going up. Latest data suggests people can expect to live about 63 years in good health.  That means men face about 16 years of ill health - a fifth of their life - and women more than 19 years or nearly a quarter of their life in poor health.  Age-related diseases, such as dementia, have been increasing.  Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, is already the leading cause of death in women and it looks set to overtake heart disease to soon become the biggest killer of men too. Hearing loss, sight loss and muscle and joint problems have also gone up. But heart attacks and strokes have gone down, as blood pressure and cholesterol levels have improved.  Obesity and smoking are the two leading risk factors for ill health.  While smoking rates have been going down, rates of obesity have been going up. In 2016, one in four adults was obese - and Public Health England expects levels of adult obesity may continue to rise. The number of people with diabetes is also rising and is expected to increase by a million to reach almost five million in 2035. Poor mental health is also taking a significant toll. In young people, mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, along with substance use, now account for a third of all ill health.  Inequalities in the health of the population also persist.  People in the richest areas of England enjoy more than 19 years more good health than those in the poorest. Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England, said: ""The challenge now is for the NHS to respond to this changing landscape and to focus on preventing as well as treating the conditions which are causing the greatest disease burden across our nation. ""In many ways it needs to respond more quickly than any time in its history because the speed of the change in these data, in the epidemiology, is really quite remarkable."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: ""As this report shows, there are a number of reasons why some people are more likely to develop these conditions than others, including genetic predisposition and socio-economic factors - but there remains a clear connection between the quality of our patients' lifestyle and their overall health.  ""It's so encouraging to see that smoking prevalence has dropped to just 15% over the last seven years, for example, but the chances of people developing illnesses like diabetes is still worryingly high and frequently is the result of poor diet and lack of exercise as well as genetic factors."" She called for more investment to help the NHS deliver the care patients needed and deserved.",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45482204,"Clinics must make it clear that there is little point in women over 40 freezing their eggs, because the odds of a future pregnancy are very slim, says UK fertility regulator the HFEA. Fertility declines with age, so the optimum time for egg freezing is before a woman turns 35, it says. Yet data shows that the most common age at which women are treated is 38, with many freezing eggs into their 40s.  NHS clinics usually have a younger cut-off age, but private ones may not.  Women can only get egg freezing on the NHS if it is for medical reasons, such as needing a cancer treatment which may cause them later fertility problems. Private clinics also offer it to women who want it for social reasons, like delaying starting a family because they haven't met the right partner yet.  In 2016, 80% of the 1,310 freezing procedures carried out were done in private clinics,  Around 890 of all the treatments were for women aged 35 and over, compared with 419 treatments for women younger than this.  The HFEA says it is not clear why patients of this age are freezing eggs. Most women freezing eggs using NHS funding were aged below 35, with 89% below 38. It says women must be given clear information about the risks, costs and likely success rates of egg freezing, which is becoming an increasingly popular ""fertility insurance"" back-up plan.  Egg freezing costs anywhere between ¬£2,720 and ¬£3,920 per go.  Most clinics will include a couple of years of storage in that price, but there may be an extra annual charge of up to ¬£350 for that service.  The complete cost if you then opt to thaw and use your eggs in a future treatment, is ¬£7,000 to ¬£8,000.  Birth rates from frozen own eggs are increasing but remain below that of conventional IVF treatment cycles, being successful one in every five times, on average, compared to around one in three for ""fresh egg"" IVF.  While a woman's age at thaw has relatively little impact on a woman's chances of success, the age at freeze does, with evidence suggesting that if eggs are frozen below the age of 35, the chances of success will be higher than the natural conception rate as the woman gets older, says the HFEA.  HFEA Chair Sally Cheshire said: ""Clinics have an ethical responsibility to be clear that egg freezing below the age of 35 offers women their best chance of creating their much longed-for family."" Aileen Feeney from Fertility Network said women should know their fertility ""vital statistics"" 28:35:42: ""By 28, female fertility has already begun to fall; 35, female fertility plummets; 42, your chance of becoming a biological mother is vanishingly small."" Prof Simon Fishel, from the independent IVF provider CARE Fertility Group, said women face a hard choice, knowing that if they freeze eggs early they can still only be stored for 10 years.",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45497304,"There will be 18.1 million new cases of cancer and 9.6 million people will die with the disease this year worldwide, a report predicts.  The rise, from 14.1 million cases and 8.2 million deaths in 2012, is partly due to a growing and ageing population.  The figures suggest one in five men and one in six women will develop the disease in their lifetime.  And as countries become wealthier, more people get cancers related to lifestyle rather than those linked to poverty.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) provides regular snapshots of the scale of cancer around the world, looking closely at 36 different cancers in 185 countries.  Researchers say while ways of measuring and collecting cancer data have improved over the years, the overall trend is that cancer rates and deaths have risen year on year.  The latest report suggests lung cancer, female breast cancer, and bowel cancer are responsible for a third of all cancer cases and deaths worldwide.  And the authors say lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in women in 28 countries.  The worst hit countries include the USA, Hungary, Denmark, China and New Zealand.  George Butterworth, from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: ""Tobacco is the single biggest reason why more women across the world are getting lung cancer than ever before.  ""In the UK smoking among women became more prolific later than it did for men, so it's not surprising that we're seeing increasing lung cancer rates now.  ""Similarly, cigarettes are now increasingly popular among women in low and middle income countries and the tobacco industry's aggressive marketing to them is influencing this."" Meanwhile, Dr Freddie Bray, of the IARC, said: ""The results highlight the need to continue to put in place targeted and effective tobacco control policies in every country in the world.""  Overall, the report estimates, nearly half of all cases and most cancer deaths in the world this year will occur in Asia, partly because of the large numbers of people living in the continent and partly because some cancers with higher death rates are more common in this region.   This includes, for example, high rates of liver cancer, which generally has a poor prognosis, in China. Beyond this, the authors say, there is ""extraordinary diversity"" in the types of cancer and patterns of illness around the world. They say because of this countries need to consider tailoring how they try to prevent and treat cancer.",,,,

The government is rolling out HPV testing as part of routine screenings for cervical cancer.  Nearly half of the women surveyed believed their partner must have cheated if they had HPV, but the virus can remain dormant for years.  Campaigners fear women may not attend screenings because of the stigma.  The survey of 2,000 women was done by Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust last month.  It found that half of the women were embarrassed and ""put off sex"" as a result of contracting the virus.  Around 35% of the women had no idea what HPV is, and nearly 60% said they thought it meant they had cancer.  Laura Flaherty, 31, who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016, is typical of the respondents.  ""When I first saw on my letter that I had been diagnosed as being HPV positive, I didn't know what it was. When I Googled it I discovered it was a sexually transmitted infection, so I automatically thought my partner had been cheating.  ""I knew nothing about it, and it felt dirty. I didn't realise it could lay dormant for so long and when I realised how common HPV is I was shocked. No-one I spoke to had heard of it, yet most of us are going to contract it.""  Myth: You can only get the virus through sexual intercourse  Fact: HPV is usually sexually transmitted, but it can also be transmitted by any skin-to-skin contact in the genital and oral areas  Myth: HPV is a sign of being promiscuous  Fact: 80% of us will contract HPV virus at some point in our lives, it's easy to get and pass on and you can get it the first time you have any sexual contact. Myth: HPV means I've got cancer  Fact: There are about 200 types of HPV. About 40 types affect the genital area, simply meaning they will live there, a few can cause unpleasant but harmless conditions like genital warts. Around 13 high-risk types can cause cervical cancer and other cancers of the genitals as well as mouth and throat cancer, but this is rare.  Myth: You'll know if you have HPV Fact: HPV is symptomless and in most cases the immune system will clear the infection. Cervical screening picks up any abnormal cells  Source: Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust The survey comes as a government initiative to test for HPV first in cervical screening, before other conditions, starts in Wales next week. It will roll out to England by 2019 and be implemented in Scotland in 2020, but there is no date for its introduction in Northern Ireland. The change means that more women will be told that they have HPV.   Robert Music, Chief Executive, Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said: ""Testing for HPV first is a far more effective way of identifying those most at risk of cervical cancer. This change to the programme does mean more women will be told they have HPV.  ""HPV can be confusing however, so we must normalise it to ensure people don't feel ashamed or scared about being told they have the virus."" HPV infection is rapidly declining in girls aged between 12 and 18 as a result of the HPV vaccine introduced in 2008.  Last year, the vaccine was extended to gay men aged 16 to 45, and in July the government announced that it will also be extended to boys, although no start date has yet been given.  There are no plans to extend the HPV vaccine to other adults over the age of 18, as the likelihood of already having the infection are high, and therefore the vaccine would be ineffective. Dr Philippa Kaye, GP and author said: ""GPs and health professionals will be having more conversations with patients about HPV as they come in to discuss their results. Understanding how it is transmitted and the relative risks will help reduce the stigma surrounding it.""",,,,

Her daughter was screaming uncontrollably and begging for help. As Bernie rushed to help, not knowing what she would find, 29-year-old Rachel was rapidly succumbing to sepsis as it ravaged her body.  Days later, Rachel was dead. On World Sepsis Day, Bernie, from Cardiff, tells Rachel's story. It was during lunch with my husband that I first knew something terrible was wrong.   I had texted Rachel that morning, but she hadn't replied.  Feeling uneasy, I rang her.  But when she answered, it was a noise I will never forget.  She was screaming uncontrollably at me, screaming in pain, screaming for me to get there.  I sped to her flat, keeping her on loudspeaker as I drove.  But when I got there, I was greeted by a terrifying sight.  Rachel was lying in bed, unable to move. Her mouth was blue and her legs were mottled and swollen, spasming with cramp.  ""Don't worry, my darling,"" I said, desperately trying to reassure her as she screamed in pain. ""We'll get you help. You'll be okay.""  But in reality, I was already too late. She was in septic shock and she was dying. I just didn't know it yet.  It was a situation made all the more impossible by the fact my daughter had been so healthy.  Rachel loved sport and fitness, and for a long time had worked as lifeguard and swimming teacher at Llanishen Leisure Centre, before becoming assistant manager. There, she mentored younger staff and made friends with her sunny personality and strong work ethic.  She was beautiful, in the bloom of her life, excited about a business idea to change her career path and open a creche for dogs.  But that weekend - the second May bank holiday in 2017 - she fell ill. It came on so quickly. Just the day before, we had been out together, enjoying a boat trip around Cardiff Bay then going on to drink cocktails. She lived with a close friend and I know that on the Sunday, she had gone to bed earlier than usual, complaining she felt unwell.  At 4am on the Monday morning, she had knocked on her flatmates' door, asking her to take her to A&E. She was vomiting and complained of feeling breathless. She told her flatmate she was frightened she was going to die - a common symptom of sepsis as it takes over the body so quickly.  Her flatmate did all she could - driving her straight to A&E at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. She was told there was a five-and-a-half hour wait to see a doctor, and that she might be best going home and taking Paracetamol.  Rachel followed the advice and went home to bed.  But at 7am, her flatmate left for work, reluctantly leaving her alone with just a sick bucket and a glass of water.  Like me, she texted throughout the morning to check Rachel was okay.  Like me, she didn't receive a reply.  It was only when I phoned, and Rachel managed through her pain to tap the screen to answer that we knew the horror that had engulfed her.  New guidelines for managing sepsis say it needs to be treated with intravenous antibiotics within the hour.  But we were already way behind.  It had consumed her, constricting her movements as it began ravaging her internal organs and tissue, leaving her in extraordinary pain.  The following sequence will be etched forever on my mind.    At first, despite the urgency of my 999 call, just one paramedic came to her flat.  He sent for an ambulance and two more paramedics arrived.  Rachel was still screaming in pain, and they couldn't even find her blood pressure, it was so low.  It was one hour and 20 minutes before she reached A&E - despite it being just a few miles away.   As we drove there, I was screaming inside my head for them to hurry.  It was only as we neared hospital that the word sepsis was first mentioned. Sepsis, I thought. What was sepsis?  But it was clear that the doctors and nurses on the Intensive Care Unit knew.  As soon as Rachel arrived, she was attached up to one drip and another, pumped full of antibiotics and fluids.  A consultant told Rachel she was going to be put under sedation to give her body a rest.  She reassured her she wouldn't die but, in reality, doctors probably knew she would be lucky if she lasted 24 hours. In fact, Rachel lasted 10 days in intensive care. She fought and fought.  But it was now 12 hours after she had first attended A&E with symptoms and the sepsis was in full control.  She had blood clots on her lungs, brain and kidneys. Her body was swollen, her beautiful face and nose disintegrating and turning black. After six days in an induced coma, she was slowly brought back round by doctors, so they could assess what damage had been done to her brain.  Rachel couldn't talk but she could communicate through blinking - one for yes, two for no.  She recognised the voices of close friends, blinking when they sang her funny Dr Dre songs.   I would sing to her in my terrible voice, mainly lyrics from the Carpenters' hit Close to You, which I had sung to her since she was a baby.  Needless to say, she blinked twice. Shut up, mum, she was saying. Stop singing.  She still had her sense of humour and we thought that night that she might just make it.  And on the following Sunday - day seven - we held out even more hope when she opened her eyes for her dad. But her body was too tired to do it more than once, and she was put back under sedation.  It was the next day, on Monday, 5 June, that consultants broke the news to us that in order to save her life, they would need to amputate her limbs.  They wanted to take both legs under the knee and her left arm.  Although horrific, it was our view that she would be able to cope with this. Before surgery, the doctors let me slide onto her bed and give her a cwtch [hug].  But when the surgeon came to talk to us afterwards, he told us the damage to her tissues had been so severe, they had had to amputate both of her arms, leaving her a quadruple amputee.  To say we were distraught is not touching it. How would Rachel cope like that? What sort of life would she have?  It was at this point I went to the chapel in the hospital.  I was screaming at God, asking why this had happened to Rachel and not me. I walked to the window, shaking violently and wanting to throw myself out.  But the chaplain must have heard me. She rushed in, wrapped a blanket around my shoulders and calmed me down.  She told me I was a mum, and as a mum, I knew what I had to do.  But then there came the final blow, delivered by a consultant in tears.  Rachel had multiple-organ failure. She wasn't going to make it anyway.   We invited all her friends to the hospital, let people say goodbye, put candles around her room, then switched off her life-support machine. This was Wednesday, 7 June 2017, and my beautiful girl was gone in minutes.  That was 16 months ago. More than 400 people came to her funeral.  Obviously, we have questions about Rachel's death. Could an earlier diagnosis have saved her?   But for now, our family is focusing on campaigning to make people more aware of sepsis.  The illness kills upwards of 44,000 people in the UK - more than bowel, breast and prostate cancer combined. The money we have raised has gone towards implementing a 'Sepsis 6 Pathway' at the University Hospital of Wales. This means anyone admitted with a fever or signs of infection will be checked against red-flag symptoms of sepsis.  We are now hoping to train paramedics and GPs to spot early warning signs, as well as getting the pathway into more hospitals.  Of course, we are also focusing on getting Rachel's story out there to the wider public.  I don't want to let her down.  If she died to save others, then I have to do what I can to get the message out there. Sepsis is triggered by infections, but is actually a problem with our own immune system going into overdrive. It starts with an infection that can come from anywhere - even a contaminated cut or insect bite. Normally, your immune system kicks in to fight the infection and stop it spreading.  But if the infection manages to spread quickly round the body, then the immune system will launch a massive immune res",,,,

""No-one trains us for what is essentially a military operation managing our kids and food - they go through phases of hating and loving different foods, because their taste buds and brains are evolving. ""Every one of my five kids has reacted differently. Some will taste things, some you have to disguise it.  ""Little River won't eat fruit whole, you have to lose it in a thick smoothie. But at least I get it in there, right? It's all about ducking and diving."" Jamie Oliver has had to do quite a bit of his trademark ducking and diving of late. He recently revealed that he was forced to inject nearly ¬£13 million of his own money to save his restaurant chain - Jamie's Italian - from bankruptcy, as well as closing 12 restaurants and making hundreds of staff redundant.  And on the day we meet, Jamie has hit the headlines again - this time as a hero for fighting off an intruder to his Highgate home. Jamie is here to talk to the BBC about what feels like a personal and professional fightback: a healthy eating partnership with Tesco.  In the past he's been criticised by those who say healthy food is unaffordable for people on a low income.   Research by The Food Foundation found that almost half of UK households can't spend enough to meet the government's recommended Eat Well Guide.  Yet this time Jamie is ready for his critics: ""Too often the rhetoric about healthy eating gets focused on affordability. Well that's important and Tesco will be reducing the cost of a basket of healthy swaps by 12%.  ""People don't want to be lectured about healthy eating. There's so much guilt involved in being a modern parent, and being a parent today is not the same as it was 20 years go. ""Mum and Dad are both mainly working, they are time-poor, and there's the mortgage. It needs to be affordable. But nevertheless the supermarket can make a difference. It has a role to play in the rhythm of most people's lives."" This week the government begins consultation on some of the measures it set out in its childhood obesity strategy in July; these include tighter restrictions on junk food advertising, banning sweets at checkouts and calorie labelling on restaurant menus.  The measures are a response to soaring levels of childhood obesity, with one in three children now overweight or obese.  Most controversial is the government's plan to force all restaurants to publish calorie counts on menus.  The Treasury says it is worried that this will push up prices and lead to thousands of job losses.  Jamie Oliver thinks the measure will hurt small businesses.  ""If you're talking about places like Pr√™t a Manger or Itsu, the grab-and-go places, I think that people would love clarity on calories. But for smaller independent places where they change the menus regularly, well they are not going to have the resources to give that nutritional information.""  Instead, he says, people should take charge at home.  ""For example, your average Briton has about a 16 gram fibre deficit, so just swapping white bread for brown is going to make a difference.  ""At the weekends I batch cook. Yes it might be 15-20 minutes work, but then you're making 15-20 portions, and you've got a two minute healthy solution during the week that is full of love and the good stuff. It's much more cost effective.""  Can Jamie Oliver make a difference? The CEO of market research company, Ipsos Mori, Ben Page said: ""I wouldn't say it's a slam dunk. Obviously I love Jamie, like the rest of us do, but generally we advise clients that celebrities are not big purchase drivers. That said, Jamie is aligned with healthy eating and has spent years talking about it. Plus, it's the general direction of travel. """,,,,

The thin spike that went through Xavier Cunningham's head ""miraculously"" missed his eyes, brain, spinal cord and major blood vessels. He fell down from a tree house when the freak accident occurred on Saturday. Kansas University Hospital told local media he is expected to recover fully, although his voice may be affected.  A team of Kansas University doctors successfully removed the square rod - which made for a trickier surgery than a rounded skewer due to the sharp edges - over several hours. Xavier was playing in a tree house at his home in Harrisonville, Missouri, when yellow jacket wasps began stinging him.  He fell from the tree house and landed directly on a foot-long (30cm) metal meat skewer. The skewer penetrated around six inches into the boys skull. Xavier's mother Gabrielle Miller told Kansas City Star that she saw her son walk into the house, screaming, with the rod ""just sticking out"" of his head. ""I'm dying Mom, I can feel it,"" Mrs Miller recalled him telling her on the way to hospital. Xavier was taken to local hospital, transferred to hospital in Kansas City and again transferred to the University of Kansas hospital where he would eventually undergo surgery. His injury had no active bleeding and had avoided his eyes, brainstem, spinal cord and blood vessels, which enabled doctors to call in expert surgeons before attempting the removal surgery on Sunday morning. Koji Ebersole, director of endovascular neurosurgery at the University of Kansas Health System, told the Star: ""You couldn't draw it up any better. It was one in a million for it to pass 5 or 6 inches through the front of the face to the back and not have hit these things."" He said the biggest concern while removing the rod was the blood vessels in the boy's neck. Dr Ebersole called the boy's recovery ""miraculous"". ""I have not seen anything passed to that depth in a situation that was survivable, let alone one where we think the recovery will be near complete if not complete,"" he told the Star.",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45487187,"Jumping into the sea in winter is the most alive and present I ever feel. I get in fast - a dangerous approach if you're a beginner - when the cold shock response provokes an uncontrollable urge to inhale.  Underwater, I feel an intense mixture of burning pain and, even after doing this for years, a little panic. But it's the only time the anxious negative chatter in my head is truly silenced.  After two minutes, as my skin reaches the same temperature as the water, I start to feel comfortable and my breathing slows. After even a brief swim, I feel elated for hours and calm for days.  Like many other people who swim in cold water regularly, I love it, but I also believe it has mental health benefits.  And the first case report on cold water swimming published in British Medical Journal Case Reports shows that it may be an effective treatment for depression. The Doctor Who Gave Up Drugs, a series broadcast on BBC One in 2016, which I developed and presented, followed Sarah, a 24-year-old who had been taking antidepressants since the age of 17. Her symptoms had started earlier in her teens. When we met, she was desperate to stop her antidepressants, saying they put her in a ""chemical fog"".  She loved swimming and, because of my own experience, I approached Prof Mike Tipton and Dr Heather Massey, both scientists at the extreme environments laboratory at Portsmouth University. I also spoke to their collaborator Dr Mark Harper, a consultant anaesthetist at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, to see if there was any scientific basis for trying out cold water swimming on Sarah.  Outdoor exercise and the companionship of fellow swimmers can improve symptoms of depression and anxiety. But the team at Portsmouth believed there might be an effect of cold water immersion itself.  There is a convincing, biologically plausible, theory about how this might work.  Immersion in cold water evokes a stress response: a set of physiological and hormonal reactions that evolved millions of years ago to cope with a wide range of potential threats.  Animal attack, jumping in cold water and sitting an exam all elicit a similar response.  Heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate all increase and stress hormones are released.  But, if you immerse yourself only a few times in water of 15C or less, this stress response is reduced.  However, it is not only the stress response to cold water that reduces with repeated immersions.  Check out the The Outdoor Swimming Society website for safety advice and more.  Prof Tipton and Dr Massey have shown that the response to the stress of exercising at altitude is also diminished.  This is called ""cross-adaptation"", where one form of stress adapts the body for another.  There is increasing evidence linking depression and anxiety with the inflammation that accompanies a chronic stress response to the physical and psychological problems of modern life.  Through cross-adaptation, cold water swimming may be able to reduce this chronic stress response together with the inflammation and mental health problems that affect so many of us.  The theory is sound, but the evidence it works is all anecdotal, apart from this case report.  Cold water swimmers describe many benefits: they never get colds and never turn the heating on in winter. Many have stories of how they came to outdoor swimming in times of grief or bereavement and found comfort, even joy, in the water.  The team at Portsmouth are starting to test these stories. A preliminary study supports the claims made about colds and further reports are being prepared about patients with a range of conditions.  Since 2006, prescriptions of antidepressants have more than doubled and, while patients may take these drugs for many years, there is debate about their effectiveness.  New approaches which attempt to tackle the multiple causes of depression are badly needed.  Dr Mark Harper is cautiously optimistic. He says: ""Our observations so far support the hypothesis that cold water swimming may have a range of benefits."" More than two years later, Sarah is still swimming and off all medication.  ""Life is good. I still have counselling but the swimming is something I'll never turn my back on,"" she says.  ""It helped me so much in a time of need."" Do not stop antidepressants or any other medication without discussion with your prescriber first.",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45520784,"Zimbabwe has launched a crowdfunding campaign to deal with an outbreak of cholera that has so far killed 25 people, mostly in the capital, Harare. New Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube sent an appeal on Twitter, sharing a mobile payment account number. An emergency has been declared and public gatherings banned in Harare to prevent the spread of infection. Some Zimbabweans have criticised the fundraising plan on Twitter, accusing the state of misusing public money. In 2008, a cholera outbreak killed some 4,000 people and at least 100,000 people fell ill. This was a key factor in persuading President Robert Mugabe to agree a power-sharing government with the opposition, as the government did not have the money to deal with the outbreak. The current outbreak began on 6 September after water wells were contaminated with sewage in Harare. Tests found the presence of cholera and typhoid-causing bacteria which has so far infected over 3,000 people, Health Minister Obadiah Moyo told reporters on Thursday.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), patients were not responding to first-line antibiotics.  ""Relevant medicines should be purchased as a matter of urgency as soon as resistance patterns have been ascertained,"" it said. WHO also said the disease has spread to five of the country's 10 provinces. The health emergency has forced the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to postpone this weekend's mock inauguration of its leader, Nelson Chamisa, as president.  Mr Chamisa has refused to back down from his claim that he won the 30 July election, even after the Constitutional Court dismissed his legal challenge against President Emmerson Mnangagwa's victory. The police had earlier withdrawn their permission for it go ahead, citing the ban on public gatherings imposed because of the cholera outbreak. His party now says the swearing in will be held at a ""later date"". The cholera outbreak can be traced to Harare city council's struggle to supply water to some suburbs for more than a decade, forcing residents to rely on water from open wells and community boreholes, according to Reuters news agency.  Health officials are advising people to wash their hands regularly, drink only safe water, wash food, cook it thoroughly and avoid shaking hands. The government-controlled Herald reports that the crowdfunding campaign has already received some backers including telecommunication giant Econet Wireless, which has contributed $10m (¬£7m). The Zimbabwe Red Cross Society has launched its own appeal. Mr Ncube's plan has been condemned on social media: Lawyer Fadzayi Mahere wanted to remind newly elected President Emmerson Mnangagwa of his campaign promise:  This user saw the campaign as another ploy from the political class: While Twitter user Bruce Zvandasara said it was more worthwhile than the opposition's call for funds to pay for their legal challenge to Mr Mnangagwa's July election victory: This Twitter user wondered why the government had the money to charter a private plane to bring back former first lady Grace Mugabe from Singapore when her mother died, but does not have funds to deal with a public health emergency: Correction 19 September 2018: This story was amended to say that the Zimbabwe Red Cross has set up its own cholera appeal rather than contributing to the crowdfunding scheme.",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45496654,"Uganda is the most physically active nation in the world, according to a recent report by the World Health Organization. The BBC's Patience Atuhaire went to find out why.  Jennifer Namulembwa spends an hour-and-a-half walking to work, five days a week. From Namuwongo on the south-eastern end of Uganda's capital, Kampala, she navigates her way past the railway line and crosses the treacherous eight-lane stretch of the highway.  She skirts the plush Kololo hill, finally getting to Kamwokya suburb by 9am.  At work, the 34-year-old spends two hours on her feet, cleaning a three-floor building.  The rest of her day is spent running errands for her boss. And just after 5pm, she traces the same route, to return home. ""I'm used to it so I don't feel the distance. I never wear nice shoes to work. I would also like to enjoy the good life sometimes; ride in a car or on a motorcycle,"" she chuckles, showing her dusty feet in black sandals. Her commute is not dictated by the size of her body, but that of her wallet.  Her salary is just over $100 (¬£70) a month. Domestic needs and her two children's education burn through it, so she can't afford to pay for transport. At 7am, the sun casts long shadows of the many people trekking along the railway line.  Along the same route walks father-of-three Oprus Aduba, a hotel worker. Wiping sweat off his brow, he too says that the numbers have failed to add up. The World Health Organization report on physical activity, which categorized Uganda as one of the most active countries in the world, probably had people like them in mind. The study, tracking the level of physical activity around the world, found that only 5.5% of Ugandans had an insufficient level of activity. Mozambique, Tanzania, Lesotho and Togo too are also doing quite well.  In comparison, people in Kuwait, American Samoa, Saudi Arabia and Iraq seem to be living highly sedentary lives. About a quarter of the world's population don't get enough exercise. The research findings note that, generally, people in low-income countries seem to integrate a sufficient amount of physical activity in their lifestyles, unlike those in wealthier countries.  The poorer people are, the more likely they are to use modes of transport, or be in an occupation, that involve physical work. However, the study, an analysis of self-reported national data, doesn't explain why Ugandans are more active than other countries with a similar level of income. Even in low-income countries, more people are getting into formal employment, spending long hours at the office, buying cars and eating more fast food, meaning Uganda might become less healthy as they become wealthier. The two Kampala walkers are not even aware of the WHO-recommended 150 minutes of moderate-to-intense or 75 minutes of rigorous activity per week.  They easily surpass the target without trying. How much? What is moderate aerobic activity? What counts as vigorous activity? What activities strengthen muscles? What activities are both aerobic and muscle-strengthening? Source: NHS  Away from the city to rural Uganda, where an estimated 70% of the population work in agriculture, the study findings ring very true.  It seems that nothing keeps one in shape better than a hoe. Abiasali Nsereko, a 68-year-old farmer in Luweero, about two hours north of Kampala, starts his day at 5am. Having finished milking the cows, real work starts.  It could be cleaning the cow shed, tending to the coffee bushes or the banana trees.  He works his 10-acre farm by himself, with the occasional hired labour. ""I spend about eight hours on my feet, six days a week. I grow all the food that we eat. If I stopped working, I would probably fall sick. At my age, I do not have a single ache in my body,"" he says.  But it is not easy for those Ugandans trying to stay fit as their lifestyles change. Kampala is not a fitness-friendly city. There are hardly any green parks, most roads have no pavements, and many cars emit the same amount of fumes as a grass hut on fire. Walking or jogging demands some bravery. If you are lucky to find a walkway, you have to watch out for open manholes, and boda bodas (motorcycle taxis), which will push you off the pavement and top it off with insults.  Motorists will not be shy to drive you into the storm-drain, in which you have to jump over plastic bags that look very suspiciously like ""flying toilets"". Still, over the last couple of years, joggers, mostly the urban elite, have increasingly appeared on the streets.  There is also a growing trend of fitness groups around the city. On a sunny Saturday morning, three different groups work out in the parking lot of Mandela National Stadium, Namboole.  From people in their 60s to a nine-year old girl, they go through their jumps, squats and stretches. To an outsider it may look like a fad, but Diana Nakabugo tells me that the group has kept her motivation up.  She's at the stadium from 6.30am three times a week, for an hour's work-out.  But it is a struggle. The pressures of a working life do not leave much room for recreational physical activity. Ms Nakabugo says: ""I wake up with traffic jam on my mind. You have to drop the kids at school, and then make it to work, on time. It's a challenge. Many parents fail to prioritise exercise."" I seek out the little girl when the session is over. For her, this is more about spending time with her dad. Sabiti Matovu is a primary school physical education teacher who practises what he preaches.  But people like him are becoming rare in Ugandan schools. ""Physical education used to be on the timetable of every school. But here in the city, schools put emphasis only on academics,"" he says, concerned about how the country will keep its youth fit. ""Many do not have playgrounds. In the rural areas where there is space, the schools don't have PE teachers.""  On 7 July, President Yoweri Museveni launched the National Day of Physical Activity, which will be marked annually. But it will take more than a presidential gesture to keep Uganda active. Amanda Ngabirano, a lecturer in Urban Planning at Makerere's College of Engineering and Technology calls herself a ""cycologist"". She drives from home with her folding bicycle in the boot, parks halfway to work, and cycles the remaining 7km (4 miles).  My jaw drops when she says: ""I pick out the roads with the most traffic.""  Imagine cars swerving from one lane to the other, jerking to a sudden stop, boda bodas weaving through any available gap, matatu drivers hooting and screaming out the windows. Add a woman on a bicycle. ""There is order in that chaos. The drivers are going slowly, and they can see me. It's safer than the upmarket roads with fewer cars because there everyone is speeding,"" she explains. Her crusade to get the city infrastructure upgraded to provide for non-motorised modes of transport has seen the ministry of works develop its first policy along those lines. Her work may be part of the reason why, less than a month ago, the Kampala Capital City Authority marked out the first bicycle lane in Kampala. The 500-metre lane is in leafy Kololo, but it is a start. The country may be celebrating the WHO study, but Uganda is rapidly urbanising.  In the next couple of decades, there are likely to be fewer 67-year-olds still fit to till the land, and more people behind the wheel in traffic snarl-ups. Roy William Mayega of the Makerere School of Public Health did a study in the peri-urban areas of Iganga district, east of the capital, in 2013. He found that Ugandan lifestyles are changing.  ""We found that 85% of the participants were physically active. We assessed blood sugar and weight as well. The 15% who were not sufficiently active were twice as likely to have diabetes and high blood pressure than those who were active,"" he says. Dr Mayega warns that the number of Ugandans interested in sectors which require rigorous effort such as agriculture is shrinking, especially among the youth. He also noticed a shift in the food environment. In every small roadside town, young people were cooking high-calorie, processed-flour foods, and people were coming from the villages for a taste.

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45497454,"Labour is calling for a ban on parents-to-be being told the sex of their baby after early blood tests, amid fears it may lead to abortions of girls. The Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT) is used by the NHS to test for genetic conditions, but people can pay for it privately to discover a baby's sex. Labour MP Naz Shah said it was morally wrong for people to use the test to abort pregnancies based on the outcome. The Department of Health said it would continue to review the evidence.  An investigation by the Victoria Derbyshire programme has found thousands of British women discussing using NIPT to determine sex on an online forum. Ms Shah, who is shadow women and equalities minister, said cultural practices in some communities like the South Asian community, have a preference for boys.  She said this put great strain on women ""forcing them to adopt methods such as NIPT to live up to expectations of family members"".  NIPT involves taking a sample from the woman to look for DNA from the baby circulating in her blood, to gauge the risk of possible genetic conditions such as Down's syndrome. It can also be used to determine sex, information which NHS doctors will not be sharing with parents when the test is rolled out across England next month.  Private clinics offer the same test for around ¬£150-¬£200 and do share this information. Some require only that a drop of blood be sent in the post with results sent back in a few days.  Ms Shah said: ""NIPT screenings should be used for their intended purpose, to screen for serious conditions and Down's syndrome. ""The government needs to look into this exploitative practice and enforce appropriate restrictions."" 'I had a panic attack when they said it was a girl' Zara, not her real name, is Sikh and lives in Greater London. ""I had straightaway made that decision that I didn't want to have this baby. ""We were a family of five girls and every time my Mum had another daughter everyone would come to the house as if they were coming to mourn.  ""For them it's like a burden. My fear was I didn't want to go through what my mother went through."" Zara discovered the sex of her baby five months into her pregnancy and opted to have a surgical abortion.     She now regrets the decision. ""You see friends and family that have daughters and they have such a lovely relationship. I'm someone's daughter and someone's sister,"" she said.  Zara says she believes abortion on the grounds of sex is a ""very common"" practice.  Rani Bilkhu from the Jeena International organisation says many women say they have suffered violence or been coerced into abortions because they were pregnant with a second or third girl.  It wants sex-selective abortion to be viewed as a form of honour-based violence.  ""No wonder they're resorting to sex-selection abortion because they've got no choice,"" she says. ""They don't want to be homeless, they don't want their marriage to fail - all because they couldn't give birth to a boy."" The online forums where British women discussed using NIPT include thousands of posts where women express their anxiety about having a girl.  One said: ""I need a son to heal me... my only bet is NIPT followed by continuation, only if it's a boy."" The programme also found one area, Slough, where women's clinics offering these tests were being promoted on roadside adverts. ""This poster is really telling the community, 'Come here, come to us and we'll let you know whether you're having a boy or a girl,'"" says Ms Bilkhu. Labour MP for Slough, Tan Dhesi, said marketing tests offering sex determination should be stamped out.  ""Communities in South Asia have made huge strides in tackling this social evil,"" he said. ""That's been primarily through legislation, banning gender determination clinics. In the UK I think we need to be doing likewise, with regards to the private sector as well."" Choosing an abortion due to sex is illegal in the UK, apart from some rare exemptions, but it is difficult to detect as women often cite other reasons for having the procedure. In 2015, the government acknowledged it did not know how widespread testing for sex was. It said if NIPT became more popular, it would need to analyse the impact it was having on the gender ratio in ethnic minority communities. Ms Bilkhu said it was extremely hard to measure.  ""Not only do the government not understand there's an issue around sex-selection abortion, but also charities and statutory sectors aren't asking the questions,"" she said.  The Nuffield Council, which advises on ethical issues, recently held a consultation on NIPT testing. It believes the ability to determine sex reinforces pressure on women to have boys.  ""The desire for sex-selection is a major driver of private-sector testing,"" said Tom Shakespeare from the council. ""I don't think the government want to regulate, they just don't like it in any sector.  ""But countries like China and India have recognised the problem of sex-selective abortion and so it's very difficult to get this information - in India it is illegal.  So if we allow it, people will come here as tourists."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""The pre-natal test is never meant to be used for determining the sex of a child. We will continue to review the evidence."" Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel in the UK.",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45513762,"The number of vapers in Great Britain has topped three million for the first time - four times the number in 2012, according to a survey by Action on Smoking and Health. Most use e-cigarettes because they have quit smoking and 40% are smokers who are trying to give up. The estimations are based on a survey of 12,000 British adults. But a ""worrying"" belief that vaping is as bad as smoking still exists, a King's College London analysis found.  Earlier this year, Public Health England said e-cigarettes should be made available on prescription because of how successful they were in helping people give up smoking. And a report by MPs in August said rules around e-cigarettes should be relaxed and their use on public transport debated. Ash, the public health charity, said this survey suggested smokers were getting the message that switching to vaping could improve their health. It estimates a 10% rise in e-cigarette users between 2017 and 2018, up from 2.9 to 3.2 million. But there are still some smokers - about a third - who have never tried one. Although increasing numbers of smokers now believe vaping is less harmful than smoking, 22% still think it is as bad or worse. And among the general public, one in four adults believes it to be as harmful as tobacco. Also from the survey, 17% correctly believed vaping to be a lot less harmful than smoking - but 23% said they didn't know which was more harmful. This compared with 13% and 29% last year. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said: ""UK policy is on the right track, with thousands of smokers making the switch to vaping and improving their health and little sign of non-smokers taking up vaping.  ""But even more smokers could benefit if e-cigarettes were licensed as medicines and available on prescription.""  Dr Leonie Brose, from King's College London, called the mistaken belief by some people that vaping was as harmful as smoking ""worrying"". ""Campaigns from Public Health England and others to challenge these views are important and must continue,"" she said. The top three reasons ex-smokers gave for using e-cigarettes were: Alison Cook, director of policy at the British Lung Foundation, said: ""It's really encouraging to see smokers using e-cigarettes to help them quit the much more harmful practice of smoking.""

Mrs Walkden, from the north-west of England, is now backing a plea by the Meningitis Research Foundation calling for more urgency and monitoring to ensure that parents receive the right advice about potential bacterial meningitis and sepsis cases among babies and young children. ""We felt reassured when the hospital told us it was an ear infection,"" she says. ""We were not told to look out for anything else. ""If we had, we might have brought her in sooner."" Guidance issued by the NHS advisory body the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) states the NHS should provide parents with ""safety netting"" advice if they bring in children with symptoms that could be a sign of meningitis and sepsis. The conditions can be difficult to spot at first because the symptoms, including a high temperature and vomiting, are similar to those of many less serious ailments. But a report published by the Meningitis Research Foundation has suggested this safety netting does not always happen. It cites research from last year that suggests nearly a third of young babies with meningitis receive inappropriate early treatment that delays parents seeking help. The report includes personal accounts of more than 100 parents, many of whom were sent home with little advice following their first visit to a health professional. Charity chief executive Vinny Smith says without safety netting advice advice parents can be put off seeking medical attention soon after being seen at hospital or by a GP - but these non-specific symptoms can turn lethal in just a few hours. ""When a child is ill and getting rapidly worse, parents should not be afraid to seek urgent medical help - even if they've already been seen by a doctor that same day,"" she says. Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. It can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults. Meningitis can be very serious if not treated quickly. It can cause life-threatening blood poisoning - sepsis - and can result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves. The symptoms include: These symptoms can appear in any order and some may not appear. The illnesses are sometimes known as meningococcal disease.  In the past decade, there have been between 700 and 1,300 reported cases of meningococcal disease each year in the UK.  Between 5% and 10% of cases result in death.   Of those who survive, 10% to 15% can be left with severe and disabling after-effects such as loss of hearing and sight, brain injury and damage to major organs or loss of limbs. The government in England says it has already taken action. A working group established by ministers has made a number of recommendations to improve care, including that it should be documented in patient's notes when safety netting information has been provided. The NHS is still in the process of rolling out the recommendations. The Royal College of GPs also says it has made the issue a top priority in recent years. It has produced a toolkit to help GPs manage and identify cases. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, says: ""GPs know all too well that meningitis and indeed any form of sepsis can lead to serious complications and in some cases can be fatal, if not recognised and treated in a timely manner.  ""But the challenge for all clinicians is that initial symptoms often present in exactly the same way as common viral illnesses such as flu, making both conditions very hard to spot in the early stages of disease. ""GPs are on permanent alert for signs of meningitis in their patients and we do speak to the parents of babies and young children about what they need to look out for which may indicate that an illness could be developing into something much more serious.""",,,,

There are proven benefits of the drug for people after a heart attack or stroke.   But the trial found no benefit for healthy people over the age of 70, and the pills increased the risk of potentially fatal internal bleeding.  Experts described the results as very important and cautioned against self-medicating with aspirin.  People are prescribed aspirin after a heart attack or stroke because the drug thins the blood and reduces the chances of a repeat attack. Some completely healthy people also choose to take aspirin to reduce their risk and there is continuing research into whether the drug can be used to cut the risk of cancer. However, most research on the benefits of aspirin is performed on people in middle age and there is mounting evidence the dangers increase as we get older.  The study was of 19,114 people in the US and Australia in good health, with no history of heart problems and over the age of 70. Half were given a daily low-dose aspirin for five years.  Three reports in the New England Journal of Medicine showed the pills did not reduce their risk of heart problems or have any other benefits. They did increase the number of major stomach bleeds.  Prof John McNeil, from Monash University, said: ""It means millions of healthy older people around the world who are taking low dose aspirin without a medical reason, may be doing so unnecessarily, because the study showed no overall benefit to offset the risk of bleeding. ""These findings will help inform prescribing doctors who have long been uncertain about whether to recommend aspirin to healthy patients."" The study also discovered an increase in deaths from cancer, although the researchers think this needs further investigation as it goes against current findings in the field.   Prof Peter Rothwell, of Oxford University, a leading expert on the drug, said the findings were definitive. ""Taking aspirin if you are otherwise healthy, over the age of 70, if you haven't had a previous heart attack or stroke, is really of very little benefit,"" he said.  ""And so self-medicating with aspirin in the absence of a definite medical indication isn't advisable."" The findings do not apply to people taking aspirin because of a heart attack or stroke -  they should continue to follow their doctor's advice.  And anybody who has been taking low-dose aspirin for a long time is advised not to stop overnight as that may also cause problems. Instead they should discuss any concerns with their GP, says Prof Rothwell. Follow James on Twitter.",,,,

At present, they have to hope their cancer will not return after surgery. The drug has been shown to improve the survival of people with stage III melanoma, with a particular mutation.  A skin cancer charity said making the treatment available on the NHS was ""a huge step forward"".  Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, with 15,400 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK. A gene mutation called BRAF is found in approximately half of cases - and around 500 of those people have stage III. This means that cancer cells have spread into skin, lymph vessels or lymph glands close to the melanoma, but they haven't spread to more distant parts of the body. The therapy, which has been approved by the health body NICE - the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - is a combination of the drugs dabrafenib and trametinib which can be taken at home as five tablets a day. It comes after a clinical trial of more than 800 patients found a lower risk of the cancer recurring in a group taking the therapy. Three years after surgery, 58% of this group survived with no relapse compared to 39% of the placebo group. The therapy was also found to increase the overall length of time people live, by reducing how many people develop an incurable form of the disease. However there were side effects, including fatigue and nausea, that occurred in a third of patients taking the therapy, and 10% of the placebo group. Gill Nuttall, from charity Melanoma UK, said: ""We are continuing to see an increase in the number of people in the UK with melanoma, especially among younger people. ""The availability of this treatment is a huge step forward for the hundreds of BRAF-positive patients who are currently left with very few options following surgery.  ""The current 'watch and wait' approach is an extremely worrying and stressful time for patients and their families."" Melanoma accounts for more deaths than all other skin cancers, with around 2,400 in the UK every year. Mirella Marlow, deputy director for the NICE Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said there were currently no treatments available for people with this stage and type of melanoma to lower the risk of the cancer coming back. She said the decision marked ""an important development in the management of melanoma"". Professor Ruth Plummer, clinical professor of experimental cancer medicine, University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, said the treatment had ""the potential to transform the standard of care for people with BRAF-positive stage III melanoma"".",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45549261,"There was a spike in deaths in England at the start of this summer's heatwave, new data reveals.  But statisticians say it is too early to tell how many of them can be attributed directly to the heat. On 25 and 26 June, when temperatures soared, there were 259 more deaths than the five-year average of 2,146 for those two days.  It coincided with temperatures rising above the level at which experts say heat-related deaths can occur.  The Office for National Statistics, which released the data, says it still needs to look at figures for July and August, as well as more information about registered causes of death, before assessing the reasons behind the rise.  The summer was the joint-hottest on record for the UK as a whole and the hottest ever in England, with the temperature peaking at 35.3C (95.5F) in Faversham, Kent, on 26 July. A heatwave can affect anyone, but the most vulnerable are older people, babies and young children and people with pre-existing health problems. On 21 and 22 June there were 214 fewer deaths than the five-year average for the same period, the quarterly report by the Office for National Statistics for the period from 1 April to 30 June shows. But when the temperature climbed into the high 20s and a heatwave alert was issued by Public Health England on 25 June, the number rose to above the average.  There were 1,205 deaths on that day and 1,200 on the following day, 26 June 2018. That compared with an average of 1,072 and 1,074, respectively for the same time of year in the previous five years (2013-2017). Maximum temperatures exceeded 24.5C - the level at which Public Health England warns that excess heat-related deaths may begin to become apparent - from 25 June, when a high of 30.1C (86.1F) - the UK's hottest of the year at that point - was recorded in London.  During that period, there were 382 more deaths than the average for the same period from 2013 to 2017. A peak and fall in the number of deaths was also recorded in April, coinciding with another spell of hot weather. There were 243 more deaths in England between 18 and 19 April than the five-year average across the same period, but 378 fewer between 21 and 23 April. The ONS quarterly report covers deaths registered in England between April and June. Overall, there were 108,537 deaths in England during the three-month period - 497 fewer than the five-year average. The next release, expected in December, will examine in detail those that might be attributable to the 2018 heatwave. Annie Campbell, an ONS statistician, said: ""Although the provisional data currently available appears to show a high number of deaths at the end of June, we can't confirm the heatwave is the cause. ""The question of deaths which might be attributable to a heatwave will be addressed in our next quarterly release.""",,,,

""I heard what sounded like a train brake, followed by a metal on metal noise.  ""It was just something completely out of the ordinary. It was a bit of a shock to the system, something I just couldn't understand or really process. ""My experience at the time was quite terrifying.""  It was his first experience of the mental health condition, psychosis. Luke was 12 years old.  He said it went on from noises to hearing words, hearing his name, to eventually hearing whole sentences ""of it almost trying to talk to me"". The main symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations and delusions and it can be caused by a specific mental health condition, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression.  It can also be triggered by traumatic experiences, stress, drugs, alcohol, as a side-effect of prescribed medication or a physical condition such as a brain tumour.  While it is not as common as depression - affecting fewer than one in every hundred - experts say it is important to recognise symptoms of psychosis early because early treatment can be more effective. People with psychosis have a higher than average risk of self-harm and suicide. The charity Rethink Mental Illness has surveyed 4,000 people and found more than half believe they wouldn't be able to identify the early symptoms. They are concerned that a general lack of awareness leads to young people not getting help early on - especially as the first episode of psychosis is most likely to happen between the ages of 18 and 24. More subtle early warning signs include withdrawing from friends, expressing strange beliefs, sudden changes in mood and confused thoughts.  Luke did try to talk to a teacher at the time but he said ""it was kind of brushed aside. I was made to feel that it wasn't something that was supposed to be talked about."" So he decided to ""be strong and keep it inside and just push forward."" Luke didn't talk about it again until he dropped out of university in his third year. He acknowledges that it would have been hard for his family to spot what he was going through.  ""They thought I was fairly quiet - because that was how I dealt with it. I'd hide myself away in my room, or focus down on something else and try and stay out of other people's way. That's just how my parents thought I was - I was just a quiet child."" But at university it reached a point where he couldn't manage both university life and trying to hide his psychosis.  He dropped out while his family thought he was still studying, and then lost contact with his family. ""When I reached the lowest point of my mental illness I disappeared,"" he explained.  ""After I went missing it was fairly obvious to my family that something was wrong and so as things came to light they realised I hadn't been at university and that was the first step to getting help. They kind of confronted me about things and they were very understanding and incredibly caring.""  It is recommended that anyone experiencing psychosis should see their GP immediately.  The typical treatment involves a combination of anti-psychotic medication, psychological therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and family or social support. Luke was put in contact with the early intervention service and given medication.  ""Looking back on it it's bizarre. At that point it was so strange to think of - now I think if I'm having a bad day I can't help but tell almost everyone. I'm quite a complainer now - it feels like just such a different mentality at the time as I was almost afraid to talk about it.""  Now 26, Luke is helping to support young people going through the same thing, and he says he can see a change in how people are more open at talking about psychosis.   ""I feel it will get less likely that people feel that they want to hide it - it's far easier to talk about rather than being something almost taboo, it's just something that happens.""",,,,

According to Canada's BNN Bloomberg, the drinks giant is in talks with local producer Aurora Cannabis about developing marijuana-infused beverages.  These would not aim to intoxicate consumers but to relieve pain.   The firm declined to comment but said it was watching the cannabis drinks market closely. ""Along with many others in the beverage industry, we are closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive cannabidiol as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages around the world,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement.  Cannabidiol, a constituent of cannabis, can help ease inflammation, pain and cramping, but has no psychoactive effect. It comes as Canada prepares to follow certain US states in legalising cannabis for recreational use, after years of permitting it for medicinal purposes.  It has given rise to a large pot growing industry and some high-profile partnerships.  Earlier this year, beer giant Molson Coors Brewing said it would make cannabis-infused drinks with Hydropothecary, while Corona-beer maker Constellation Brands invested $4bn more into pot firm Canopy Growth. A partnership between Coke and Aurora would mark the first entry of a major manufacturer of non-alcoholic drinks into the market. Quoting unnamed sources, BNN Bloomberg said Coca-Cola was in ""serious talks"" with Aurora but no deal had been finalised.  ""They're pretty advanced down the path"" of doing a deal, one source was quoted as saying.  ""It's going to be more of the 'recovery drink' category,"" the source added.

The team at University College London has developed a device which shines light into the brain to monitor oxygen and energy levels. Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) could help doctors assess brain damage earlier and tailor treatment. A clinical trial of the technology is now planned. According to the National Neonatal Database, around three in 1,000 babies born in England suffer brain injury at or soon after birth, due to lack of oxygen during delivery.  While many affected newborns recover, more than half develop disabilities, and one in 10 dies.  The risk is higher in babies born before 37 weeks, where up to 26 in 1,000 babies are affected. Early detection and treatment of brain injury could help doctors work out whether treatments are working and predict the severity of injury.  Until now, doctors have often had to wait several days before newborn babies are stable enough to undergo an MRI scan to look for brain injury. Doctors already use light sensors to measure tissue oxygen levels, but the new equipment also measures energy levels in brain cells.  Speaking at the British Science Festival in Hull, Dr Gemma Bale, an engineer from University College London working on the NIRS instrument, explained: ""The device, which can be used straight after birth, is placed on the head and shines red and infra-red light into the brain.  ""This type of light can more easily penetrate the body, like when you shine a torch on your hand. ""Changes in brain oxygen levels and energy usage change the colour of the light that is reflected back.  ""Our sensors measure the reflected light to work out whether brain cells are healthy or damaged,"" she said. Babies with reduced metabolism are those who are likely to do badly, as it means parts of their brain are too damaged to function.  Dr Bale said this offered a more patient-focused approach.  ""The first week after birth is a really critical time in babies' development. If we are able to get in sooner to assess the damage, we can tailor treatment to save lives and help prevent disability further down the line."" Dr Kathy Beardsall, a neonatologist from Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, said: ""In these vulnerable babies, being able to use a bedside, non-invasive technology would be a great advance in care.  ""It overcomes the problem of having to wait and transfer babies off the intensive care unit for an MRI when they are more stable.""

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45558294,"Midwives are calling for official guidance on how much weight is healthy for women to put on during pregnancy. One in five women in the UK are obese when they start pregnancy, yet there is no national target for what constitutes normal pregnancy weight gain.  Regular weigh-ins fell out of favour in the 1990s when it was suggested that they cause pregnant women unnecessary anxiety for little or no clinical gain. Officials say they are considering whether to reintroduce them.  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is reviewing its weight advice for pregnancy.  Its current guidelines say weight and height should be measured at the first appointment, but not repeatedly during pregnancy as a matter of routine. US guidelines do recommend keeping track of weight gain, and set clear targets:  NICE says it is considering whether to adopt the same recommendations in its new advice, which is still in the early phases of planning - meaning it is unlikely to be published before 2019. Its current guidelines advise against dieting when pregnant, but do say pregnant women should avoid ""eating for two"". Energy needs do not change in the first six months of pregnancy and increase only slightly in the last three months, when mothers-to-be need around 200 extra calories per day. Mandy Forrester from the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said some UK midwives were already using the US weight guidelines, but that others did not have access to weighing scales. ""There is a clear need for midwives to have the tools, guidance and training they need so they can offer women the best possible support and care. This is especially pressing because of the potentially serious complications that can arise in pregnancy as a result of women being overweight or obese."" Women who are obese (with a BMI over 30) when they become pregnant face an increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, miscarriage and pre-eclampsia.  Being over or underweight during pregnancy might also have a negative impact on the baby, according to research.  The comments from the RCM come as a new study published in the journal Diabetologia says either too much or too little weight gain during pregnancy is linked with adverse outcomes in children aged seven years.  The Hong Kong study looked at 905 mothers and their children, and found health problems such as high blood pressure and poorer blood sugar control.",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45559954,"South Africa's highest court has legalised the use of cannabis by adults in private places. Pro-marijuana activists cheered in the public gallery and chanted ""Weed are free now"" when the Constitutional Court gave its landmark ruling.  In a unanimous ruling, judges also legalised the growing of marijuana for private consumption.  South Africa's government had opposed its legalisation, arguing the drug was ""harmful"" to people's health.  It has not yet commented on the ruling, which is binding.  Three cannabis users who had faced prosecution for using the drug brought the case, saying the ban ""intrudes unjustifiably into their private spheres"".  In his judgement, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said: ""It will not be a criminal offence for an adult person to use or be in possession of cannabis in private for his or her personal consumption.""  It will, however, remain illegal to use cannabis in public, and to sell and supply it.  The Cannabis Development Council of South Africa welcomed the ruling, and called on the government to drop charges against people found in possession of the drug. Jeremy Acton, the leader of the Dagga Party, which campaigns for the use of cannabis, said the ruling should have gone further to legalise the carrying of marijuana in public.  Cannabis is referred to as ""dagga"" in South Africa.  By Andrew Harding, BBC News, Johannesburg  This judgement is a reminder that South Africa's hard-won constitution is among the most liberal in the world, backing individual rights, and in this case the right to grow and smoke your own marijuana in private, against the government's concerns about public health and public order. The Constitutional Court's ruling focuses on the issue of privacy, and a person's right to do as they please in their own home.  The potential implications of the binding judgment are enormous, and unpredictable - particularly in terms of the criminal justice system, which routinely locks up thousands of overwhelmingly poor South Africans for using or dealing in small amounts of cannabis. It is possible that the ruling, by allowing users to grow their own marijuana at home, could undermine the stranglehold of powerful drug gangs that blight so many communities. But the police, who argued against this change, will worry that the ruling will create more ambiguity and send the wrong signal to criminals.  The court has not approved - in any form - the trade in marijuana, meaning the government will not be able to profit from taxing a legalised industry. In political terms, the landmark ruling emphasises the primacy of South Africa's constitution, which brushed aside the united opposition of numerous government ministries at a time when the authority and credibility of many of this young democracy's other institutions have been eroded by corruption and poor governance. The court gave parliament 24 months to change the law to reflect its ruling.  Adults who used marijuana in private would be protected by the ruling until the law was amended.   The court did not specify the quantity of cannabis a person can grow or use in private.  Parliament would have to decide on this, it said.   In April Zimbabwe became the second country in Africa, after Lesotho, to legalise the use of marijuana for medical use.",,,,

The conclusion comes after a study of almost 900 yoghurts on sale in UK supermarkets. The Leeds University-led research found that organic yoghurts were among the most sugary types - containing more sugar per 100g than cola. Only natural and Greek-style yoghurts could be classed as low in sugar. The study - published in BMJ Open - comes as government health officials are encouraging manufacturers to reduce the amount of sugar consumed by the public. Yoghurts have been identified as one of the food types on which Public Health England wants to see progress. This research was undertaken shortly after the launch of the sugar-reduction programme. Unsurprisingly, yoghurt desserts contained the most sugar - an average of 16.4g per 100g. This category also included some products that did not contain yoghurt, such as chocolate mousse and creme caramel. The second most sugary product was organic yoghurts with a typical 13.1g per 100g. Children's yoghurts typically contained 10.8g per 100g, the equivalent of more than two sugar cubes, the study found. By comparison a 100g serving of a typical cola contains 9g of sugar. The NHS recommends that children aged four to six have no more than 19g of sugar, or five sugar cubes a day, and it is advised that those aged seven to 10 consume less than 24g daily. To be classed as low sugar there needs to be no more than 5g per 100g. Only 9% of products surveyed were below this threshold. Desserts - 16.4g per 100g Organic - 13.1g per 100g Flavoured - 12g per 100g Fruit - 11.9g per 100g Children's - 10.8g per 100g Dairy alternatives - 9.2g per 100g Drinks - 9.1g per 100g Natural and Greek - 5g per 100g Since the fieldwork for the study was carried out - at the end of 2016 - progress has been made on reducing sugar consumption from yoghurts. A report published in May showed sugar content in yoghurts had been reduced by 6% in the first year, making it the only food category to exceed the 5% target. By 2020, it is expected sugar will be reduced by 20%. PHE chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said this showed ""positive steps"" were being made. But Dr Bernadette Moore, lead researcher of this study, said: ""Even if we take the reduction into account, most of these yoghurts will still not be low in sugar.

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45549259,"The British Nutrition Foundation is launching a concept called the ""quality calorie"", to make people think more about the types of foods they eat.  While most adults consume more than they need, simply counting calories and cutting down is not enough, it says. It wants people to look at nutritional values to select the best calories. Public Health England said excess calories were the root cause of obesity and tackling the issue was a priority. Calories give people energy - women need about 2,000 a day and men 2,500. Public Health England suggests: Food packaging will tell you how many calories (kcal) the contents have - but working out the healthiest choice can be trickier.  High-calorie foods are often less healthy but not always. And those sold as low-calorie may not be the healthiest.  Low-calorie means: Manufacturers are allowed to say their food is calorie-free if a serving has fewer than five calories - but these still count.  Experts often refer to alcohol - but any food or drink high in sugar but low in nutritional value can be said to have empty calories.  When people say hidden calories, they mean foods or drinks higher in calories than most people might expect.  About a quarter of calories now come from food and drink consumed outside of the home, according to government research. Increasingly, cafes, coffee shops and restaurants are making calorie information more visible. But it can still be difficult to keep track, especially if you add extra ingredients and flavours to your purchase.  According to Public Health England, a healthy diet should include: Things to cut down on are: A body mass index calculator can help you judge if you are a healthy weight or not. If you do need to lose weight, NHS Choices says aim to lose about 0.5-1kg (1-2lb) a week by consuming about 500-600kcal fewer a day than you need. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: ""We clearly need to improve the nation's diet but excess calories are the root cause of obesity - this is why we are working with the food industry to reduce sugar and calories in everyday foods."" Dr Frankie Phillips, from the British Dietetics Association, said: ""If you are eating too many calories, then you need to be cutting down but also making sure the ones you are consuming count for more in terms of nutrition. It's about getting value for your calories. ""Focusing on just one nutrient, like cutting down on only fat or sugar or calories, runs the risk of missing out on crucial nutrients.""",,,,

Government health officials have said smokers stand a much greater chance of succeeding giving up by using official NHS support or turning to e-cigarettes. Research has shown only 4% of those who go ""cold turkey"" remain smoke-free after a year.  But turning to nicotine replacement therapies, such as patches or lozenges, can increase that by 1.5 times. And getting help from an NHS stop-smoking clinic leads to a four-fold rise in the chances of succeeding, according to Public Health England. This year's Stoptober campaign will see the introduction of a free online personal quit plan service. It asks a number of questions and provides smokers with a suggested combination of support based on their level of tobacco dependency and what quitting support they have used previously. It will be available from Thursday ahead of the official start of the campaign, on 1 October. PHE deputy medical director Dr Jenny Harries said: ""There are many different types of stop smoking support available, so it can be difficult for a smoker to know what will work for them. ""The important thing is not to be put off trying to quit even if you have not managed it in the past."" Smoking rates have hit a record low in England - just 15% of the adult population smoke, a drop of a quarter since 2011.  That equates to just over six million smokers in total.

Everyone in Denmark knows someone who has gone through IVF and talking about it is no taboo - chats at the schools gates or even church frequently revolve around the origins of people's children. Pia Crone Cristensen - mother to two-year-old Sara, thanks to IVF and donor sperm - is one of a growing number of single women making use of Denmark's liberal IVF rules. After failing to find a suitable partner to father her children, she decided to go it alone, when she was 39. ""I think it's great that women finally have the upper hand - we can choose to become pregnant if we want to. I think that the problem is not necessarily that women don't want the men but that the men don't want to commit to having children. It's either doing it solo or not having children at all. ""I was lucky to become pregnant in the first round of the IVF. I remember giving birth and was just so grateful. I sat in the chapel of the hospital crying. I just needed to be grateful somewhere. ""People are very open about it. I went to a baptism not too long ago and I guess because people know that I got Sara the way I did, they were telling me, 'Oh, we're trying for another baby. You know, we got this one with IVF and we're trying again.' You don't necessarily have to be very close to have that conversation."" Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK The birth of Troels Renard √òstbjerg in 1983 marked the start of Denmark's journey from just another developed country trying to make the fledgling technology work better to becoming the world record holder for ART births.   Today, only Israel challenges Denmark's IVF crown. It has far more cycles of IVF per million inhabitants - about 5,000 compared with Denmark's 2,700. But a much lower natural birth rate and higher IVF success rate means that Denmark wins on the proportion of babies in the population born thanks to reproductive technology. Prof Claus Yding Anderson, at Copenhagen's University Hospital, was part of the team that bought IVF to Denmark. He attributes its popularity to generous state funding. ""It reflects that we have a public health care system that is paying. Anything which is treatment in Denmark is free, full stop.  ""We had this national discussion that the public health care system takes care of a nose which is bending to one side, or ears which [stick out], where basically you are not sick, so it was pretty straightforward to say, 'Well of course we need to include IVF.' ""Money doesn't grow on trees in Denmark but this is the Scandinavian system. Everybody is willing to pay a lot in tax but everybody is benefiting."" The Changing Face of Procreation was broadcast on the BBC World Service. Click here to listen to the first part and here to listen to the second part. Or you can download the programmes via the BBC World Service Documentary podcast. Dr Sebastian Mohr, from Sweden's Karlstad University, has followed the growth of reproductive technology, ""Denmark has reproduced itself as a certain kind of nation. The state financing it, the people using it, the medical professionals lobbying around it - reproduction has become a national project rather than just a project of the individual."" But he points out that along with generous state funding comes state control of access to IVF.  Detailed criteria are not published but only people deemed to be ""fit parents"" are approved. Women over 40 don't get state-funded treatment and those over 45 are also barred from accessing IVF privately.  Dr Mohr argues that the decision-making process should be more public. He is investigating records of IVF funding decisions and says he has seen evidence that people who are considered ""too disabled"" are denied state funding.  It didn't used to be this way. During the 1980s and 1990s, IVF and other reproductive technologies went largely unregulated in Denmark. Doctors decided who should get treatment, initially only offering heterosexual couples the chance to conceive. However, private clinics were free to treat anyone, and anything was possible: surrogacy (now banned in Denmark), IVF using donor sperm, and access for lesbian women. IVF became controversial. Radical feminists complained that it meant medically trained men were commodifying women's bodies, while social conservatives also objected to the technology.  But in 1997 the government passed the Act on Artificial Fertilisation. Single women and lesbians - who for years had been able to pay for IVF and donor insemination - were now barred.  The new legislation sparked a fight for equality of access - but in the meantime, others spotted a loophole.  The law only banned doctors from carrying out the procedures, which led to a boom in specialist midwife-led clinics.  One such facility, the StorkKlinic, named after its midwife founder Nina Stork, became a big draw for single and lesbian women from across Europe wanting to start families. Just 5% of its clients today are Danish. ""The law opened up the possibility for entrepreneurs to establish a clinic where people could use these services even though the actual intention of the law was to exclude people,"" says Dr Mohr. ""These clinics showed that it could be done responsibly."" In 2007 the current ART law was passed, granting access to state-funded IVF regardless of a woman's marital status or sexuality.  It marks Denmark out as one of the most permissive countries in the world in terms of who can get IVF and the decades of debate have moulded Danish society into one in which most people support the government's position.  The fertility industry is now one of Denmark's most successful exports and the country is is also home to the world's biggest sperm bank, Cryos International, which deals with customers around the world. However, as the number of Danish women accessing IVF and insemination to have children has grown, so has the backlash. Rasmus Ulstrup Larsen says that last year he was the most hated man in Copenhagen.  A 28-year-old high school economics teacher, he has become the unlikely figurehead for a section of Danish society that remains deeply unsettled by the social changes brought about by Denmark's liberal assisted reproduction laws.  In particular, some worry about the growing number of single women, such as Pia Crone Christensen, having children. In 2017, Mr Larsen gained notoriety with a newspaper article that called solo mums ""a horrible modern phenomenon"" (in Danish). ""This increase of solo mums is a result of a sociological evolution. We see here in Denmark an individualistic ethics of self-realisation. It's the same as the high divorce rate. It's the same kind of culture that cultivates both things.  ""We need more common goals, a more shared way of living instead of this individualistic way of perceiving life."" But he accepts he's fighting a losing battle.  Increasing numbers of single Danish women are having babies with donor sperm. The proportion of babies born in Denmark thanks to reproductive technology is steadily rising.  And as long as Denmark's fertility rate stays low, the government is likely to keep supporting treatment that helps the population to grow.",,,,

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-45575361,"Is it really possible to reduce violent crime by tackling it like an infectious disease? London has announced it is to follow Scotland's public health approach to help tackle violent crime. The idea of treating crime as a disease is not new, however. It originated on the streets of Chicago more than two decades ago and has its roots in the fight against Aids in Africa. London has already seen 100 murders this year following a surge in violence which has focussed attention on knife crime in particular. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has come under increasing pressure to take action and old debates about police stop and search powers have been revived. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has admitted her officers are ""stretched"". It is a situation that bears similarities with the streets of Chicago 20 years ago.  Dr Gary Slutkin, an epidemiologist with the World Health Organisation, returned there in the mid 1990s after years spent fighting infectious diseases in Asia and Africa.  In Uganda he had tackled the spread of Aids with some success. However, he had become jaded by the death and misery he witnessed and was looking forward to a break. Instead, he was shocked by the violence and death he encountered in his homeland.  ""I saw that all this violence was happening in America and I didn't even know, as I'd been away for so long, I thought America had no problems,"" he said. ""When I came here I saw in the newspapers and TV that there were 14 year olds shooting 13 year olds in the head. Killing them. Just little kids shooting each other. What is this?"" Between 1994 and 1999, 4,663 people were murdered in Chicago. By comparison, Los Angeles - which had a significantly higher population - had only seen 3,380 homicides.  Intrigued, Dr Slutkin began to investigate. He looked at the data and noticed a number of similarities between the violence in Chicago and the epidemics he had just spent years trying to cure. He realised violent incidents were occurring in clusters at certain locations and at certain times.  Furthermore, the violence appeared to be replicating itself, similar to an infectious disease. One violent incident would lead to another and then another, and so on.  Finally, violence was increasing rapidly in a fashion very similar to an epidemic wave. As an epidemiologist, he knew to look for three things before classing a disease as contagious; clustering, self-replication and epidemic waves. Dr Slutkin concluded Chicago was facing an epidemic disease just as bad as he had witnessed in Uganda.  He decided to treat the problem in the same way. Moved to action, he obtained funding from a local university and set up Cure Violence - a project dedicated to using public health methods to tackle violent crime. As with the fight against Aids, the first rule was that violence should not be treated as ""a problem with bad people"". Instead, it would be treated as a contagion that infected people. This meant aiming to prevent violence before it broke out and mitigate it once it had. In Uganda, Dr Slutkin and his colleagues had learned people would only listen to safe sex advice if it was delivered by their peers. ""We used people who had the same access and reach from the same population,"" Dr Slutkin says. ""Gay men to reach gay men, sex workers to reach sex workers."" In Chicago, he adopted a similar approach. Controversially, he recruited former gang members to educate current gang members, intervene in disputes and hopefully prevent the violence at source. The results were instant; crime in its pilot area, West Garfield, dropped significantly. Soon the project was being adopted across other troubled parts of the city. Key to its success were the former gang members, known as Violence Interrupters. Employed as a link between - but crucially separate from - law enforcement and the gangs, they used their community contacts to identify high-risk situations and individuals and then intervene in disputes before they escalated into violence.  Angalia Bianca was a member of the infamous Latin Kings gang for more than 30 years before becoming a violence interrupter seven years ago. ""It's all about buying time in most situations, trying to calm people down and talk them down from doing something they'll regret,"" she says. ""These guys out here aren't going to listen to police, but we have a reputation and a street cred. ""We used to live our lives out on the streets, gangbanging, committing crimes. We speak their language."" The impact of this community engagement approach has been significant. Since the project began, shootings have fallen by as much as 40% in areas where violence interrupters have been present. Other cities in the United States have followed suit, most notably Los Angeles, New York and Baltimore. In Scotland, Glasgow has adapted the approach - incorporating it into a wider public health strategy involving education, health and social services. The city has seen its murder rate drop by more than a half between 2004 and 2017. The success of Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit, which received ¬£7.6m in Scottish government funding between 2008 and 2016, has now caught the eye of Mr Khan. However, the strategy is not without its problems. In Chicago, funding has been a perennial issue.  In 2015, Cure Violence went the first of two years without a full state budget due to a stalemate between governor Bruce Rauner and House Speaker Mike Madigan. Dr Slutkin believes this led to a loss in lives. ""We wrote a letter and said this was going to be a disaster, in other words predicted it,"" he said. ""We lost all of the workers for 13 communities."" The following year, 771 people were murdered in Chicago - the city's deadliest year in nearly two decades. In 2017, after the Cure Violence team had regained its funding, there was a 16% decline in murders. Over the past year, London has experienced its own surge in violent deaths. Dr Slutkin's public health approach appears to be a catalyst to the Mayor of London diagnosing the capital's violence as a ""disease"". However, there is a significant difference in scale. This year, Cure Violence received funding of $5.4m (¬£4.1m) in Chicago and $17.2m (¬£13m) in New York. Mr Khan has only put up ¬£500,000 for the project in London, a figure described by criminologist Anthony Gunter as a ""joke"". He feels the mayor has been ""slow"" to react to London's violence issue but is a fan of the Chicago approach, although he points out the city's murder rate remains high. ""The devil is in the detail and at this stage there isn't much detail,"" he says of Mr Khan's announcement. ""It needs a multi-agency approach and everyone working together. It will need Sadiq Khan to work with (home secretary) Sajid Javid."" For some communities in London, Chicago and Glasgow, violence is part of everyday life. It is part of wider social issues such as unemployment, education, broken families and drugs. Whether Mr Khan's diagnosis of violence as a disease will make a difference remains to be seen.  One person who is happy about the announcement, though, is Sarah Jones, who has been campaigning for the public health approach since being elected Labour MP for Croydon Central in 2017.  She believes violence interrupters could be key to stopping knife crime in parts of London. ""There are small groups across London which fulfil a similar role, but we need to have more people who have that respect and trust in that community,"" she says. ""Having someone to intervene at the point where they are thinking about being violent can make a massive difference.  ""The Violence Reduction Unit is a step in the right direction, but it needs commitment from everyone in the long run.""",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45590203,"When Jackie Britton was given a blood transfusion after childbirth, she thought it was saving her life. But the infected blood could have killed her. There are thought to be thousands like her. They often feel overlooked in the wider NHS contaminated blood scandal. ""There are still people dying, not knowing they are infected,"" Jackie Britton, from Portsmouth, tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. She gave birth in 1983. Her baby daughter was fine but when Jackie started haemorrhaging she needed a blood transfusion. It would be another 29 years before she realised that that blood had been contaminated with hepatitis C, for which there was no blood screening at the time. The virus went undetected for years, slowly damaging Jackie's liver. As she puts it: ""The four units of blood that had saved my life was killing me."" Jackie started noticing something might be wrong only in her 50s, when she was experiencing ""absolute fatigue"". ""I would feel physically sick. I would start retching just stood up trying to cook a meal, because of the effort and the energy it was taking out of me. ""Hep C is just trauma after trauma."" A new generation of drugs means Jackie has now cleared the virus itself from her body - but the damage has already been done.  She has cirrhosis of the liver and needs checks every six month to make sure it has not led to cancer or liver disease. The contaminated blood scandal of the 1970s and 1980s is often called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Almost 5,000 people with the blood disorder haemophilia were given a treatment contaminated with hepatitis and in many cases HIV. Then there is a second group of people who like Jackie received a blood transfusion after childbirth or an operation.  There are no solid figures available on exactly how many transfusion patients were infected before 1992. But estimates range from about 5,000 - the same number of people with haemophilia affected - to up to 28,000, the figure suggested by a Department of Health analysis of the scandal. It is thought there will still be some people living today with hepatitis C, contracted by blood transfusion, who have not yet been diagnosed. For Bob Leary, now 72, it all started in 1986 with a burst intestine.  Admitted to hospital and given a transfusion, he didn't think much more of it until he had a blood test four years later. He was told he had hepatitis C and could expect to live for another 10 to 15 years. ""As you can imagine, it was a very severe shock,"" he says. By 2012, Bob's liver had started to fail. He became jaundiced and lost weight dramatically.  The following year, having been told he had just weeks left to live, a liver transplant saved his life.  He will be on medication until he dies. ""I don't want to get into the blame culture, I could be bitter all my life,"" he says, ""but we need to make sure nothing like this happens again."" His hope is that a public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal, set to begin on Monday, will provide some answers. It comes after years of campaigning from victims and their families. Key issues include: For Jackie, it is about far more than her own health. Last year, her friend and fellow campaigner Sally Vickers died from cancer caused by the hepatitis C she contracted in 1982 following an operation. ""She loved living. I mean she fought and fought,"" says Sally's husband, Alan. He remembers the moment she was given less than a month to live. ""The specialist came down and said, 'I'm sorry, it's not only severe cancer in your liver but it has spread to your lungs. ""We simply wanted to come home so that she could be with me."" The anger Alan and Sally felt, however, was not directed at doctors, or the NHS, but at the people responsible for the whole blood donation system at the time in the Department of Health. ""I want somebody held accountable for it,"" Alan says. ""Somebody has got to be accountable for this."" The Cabinet Office said in a statement: ""The Infected Blood Inquiry is a priority for the government. ""It is extremely important that all those that have suffered so terribly can get the answers they have spent decades waiting for and lessons can be learnt so that a tragedy of this scale can never happen again. ""Government is committed to providing the inquiry with all the support it needs.""

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45591584,"Emotional testimonies from people infected with HIV and hepatitis have been heard at the start of the inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal. The public inquiry is looking at how thousands of NHS patients were given infected blood products during the 1970s and 1980s in what has been dubbed the worst-ever NHS treatment disaster. In a video played to the inquiry, one man described how he felt he lost his entire life after finding out at the age of 43 that he had been infected with hepatitis C when he was a child. He was given an injection of blood products when he was eight for a swollen knee that was misdiagnosed as haemophilia. ""I lost everything. I lost my whole life the day I found out - everything ended,"" he explained. With her identity hidden, one woman said she became infected with HIV through her husband who was a haemophiliac, and who had been given contaminated blood. She said when they found out they were left stunned and devastated. ""This was the mid-1980s and the climate of fear, discrimination and stigma associated with HIV and Aids was horrendous,"" she added.  ""We coped the best we could. We were silenced, and we kept quiet."" Another victim, a widow, whose husband John died of Aids in 1994 and who also had hepatitis C, said: ""I feel we have been treated very badly. Nobody has listened to us over the years."" There have been previous inquiries into the scandal, but this is the first UK-wide public inquiry that can compel witnesses to testify. It comes after decades of campaigning by victims, who claim the risks were never explained and the scandal was subsequently covered up.  About 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses over a period of more than 20 years - nearly 3,000 of them have since died. This was because they were injected with blood products used to help their blood clot. It was a new treatment introduced in the early 1970s. Before then patients faced lengthy stays in hospital to have transfusions, even for minor injuries. Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment - known as clotting agent Factor VIII - and so supplies were imported from the US.  But much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. The blood products were made by pooling plasma from up to 40,000 donors, and concentrating it. People who underwent blood transfusions were also exposed to the contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s the products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this, and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991 and by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk. Steve Dymond is now in his early 60s. He initially had only mild symptoms of haemophilia and led an active life. During the 1980s his health began to suffer. His muscles were sore, his joints ached and he was always exhausted.  After going to hospital following a minor hand injury in the mid-1980s, he was told he had been treated with Factor VIII that had not been heat-treated. The concern was that he may have been exposed to HIV. At the time it took 18 months to get a diagnosis - a wait that his wife Su Gorman said put their lives on hold. He was given the all-clear, but in the 1990s was diagnosed with hepatitis C.  He is now clear of hepatitis C, although his health has continued to suffer.  Two years ago he suffered a near-fatal stomach bleed, has suffered hearing loss and has a damaged liver, leaving him at risk of cancer. He said people have been ""betrayed and lied to"" throughout, with the government, health professionals and drug companies all guilty of trying to avoid responsibility. ""It is difficult to try to imagine - even though there is a public inquiry - how they will be able to get past these walls of obfuscation,"" said Mr Dymond. The government has been strongly criticised for dragging its heels.  There have been previous inquiries. One was led by Labour peer Lord Archer of Sandwell and was privately funded. It held no official status and was unable to force witnesses to testify or force the disclosure of documents. Meanwhile, the Penrose Inquiry, a seven-year investigation launched by the government in Scotland, was criticised as a whitewash when it was published in 2015. Greater Manchester mayor and former health secretary Andy Burnham has repeatedly called for a probe into what happened. Mr Burnham claimed in the House of Commons last year that a ""criminal cover-up on an industrial scale"" had taken place. The government announced there would be an inquiry only after it faced a possible defeat in a vote on an emergency motion. The inquiry could last more than two years. Payments have been made to some of the people who were infected - the first fund was set up as long ago as 1989. But if the new inquiry finds culpability, it opens the door to victims seeking large compensation payouts through the courts. Retired judge Sir Brian Langstaff, who is leading the inquiry, said it marked the start of something which several people had campaigned for over many years. He said there had already been more than 100,000 documents submitted, with the prospect of lots more to come. Speaking at the start of the inquiry, he said if the campaigners were right there was a ""real chance"" the numbers affected could rise as there would be people out there who did not yet know they had been infected. ""It is a truly sobering thought,"" he added. Liz Carroll, chief executive of The Haemophilia Society, called on the inquiry to work diligently to ""uncover the truth, bring justice and ultimately closure for victims and their families"". ""This scandal devastated generations of people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders. ""Our members have waited decades for this to be properly investigated.""

There are strict criteria for NHS artificial insemination and many women say private treatment is too expensive, so they turn to the internet. One woman told how a potential donor she met turned out to be married and had had a vasectomy. A fertility expert called for unregulated sites to be shut down.   Online sperm donation is not illegal but it must be provided free, although expenses can be covered. Some online donors offer artificial insemination (AI) and others natural insemination (NI) - effectively unprotected sex with a stranger. ""Sarah"", 26, from Yorkshire, is single and said she wanted a baby without a partner. She told BBC Inside Out the cost of private treatment was too high and going online meant the treatment was free, although she did experience problems. She said: ""There have been a few idiots that you really wouldn't want to interact with, because they do harass you or start sending you images you really don't need to see."" Couple Kirsti and Danielle, from West Yorkshire, said they had faced pressure from men online to use NI. Kirsti said: ""Some people try to put you off by sending you messages of miscarriages and stuff, like if you do it that way, this will happen.  ""So they are trying to change your mind for the method, so then you have sex with them.""  Sarah did meet one man online but he was not as he seemed. ""Ultimately it turned out he was married and that he'd actually had a vasectomy, so was in no way viable at all,"" she said. ""It made me feel like I couldn't trust people on the site.  ""I think they do need to be policed by a proper organisation, not just some random person out there because you don't know if they're safe because there's no proof of who you are on there."" Registered clinics carry out a strict screening process for sexually transmitted infections and infectious diseases and check potential donors' complete medical history. Alison Lamont, from one of these, Newcastle Fertility Centre, said it was difficult for the clinic to find donors. Fertility expert Dr Larisa Corda said the growing trend of online sperm donation was ""really alarming"". She said: ""I think women are putting themselves in an incredibly vulnerable position medically speaking and secondly the potential for abuse."" She said she believed the cost was a real barrier to a lot of women and it meant they were putting themselves in vulnerable situations, such as using unregulated online donors. ""In the ideal world, I'd love to see them shut down because I think women's safety and welfare has to be paramount here,"" she said. Dr Tamara Turner-Moore, senior lecturer in psychology at Leeds Beckett University, is involved in a study about online sperm donation, which she believes will be the first of its kind. It will look at the number of websites offering sperm, what the sites look like and the profiles of men using them and how they present themselves. The study will also look at women's experiences including those who have experienced sexual violence by online sperm donors. It hopes to get an idea of the number of such sites and the problems women face and raise awareness of them.

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45601052,"Obesity is set to overtake smoking as the biggest preventable cause of cancer in UK women by 2043, a Cancer Research UK report predicts. Currently, 12% of cancers in women are linked to smoking, and 7% to being overweight and obese. But with the number of smokers falling and obesity rates projected to rise, the charity estimates that gap will disappear in 25 years time. The figures assume that current trends will continue. Cancer Research UK's projections calculate that by 2035, 10% of cancers in women (around 25,000 cases) could be related to smoking and 9% (around 23,000 cases) to carrying excess weight. And by 2043, if those trends continued, being overweight and obese could be linked to even more cases of cancer than smoking in women. In UK men, obesity is not predicted to overtake smoking as a preventable cause of cancer until some time later, because more men than women smoke. Although obesity is more common among men too, obesity in women is thought to be a greater driver of cancers in the female population. The report says types of cancer linked to smoking include acute myeloid leukaemia, lung, bladder, bowel, cervical, pancreatic and stomach.  Cancers linked to being overweight or obese include bowel, gall bladder, kidney, liver, breast, ovarian and thyroid. Professor Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK's prevention expert, said the government must build on the lessons of smoking prevention to reduce the number of weight-related cancers. She said those who were overweight in childhood were five times more likely to be carrying excess weight as an adult. Recent figures show that levels of severe obesity during childhood have risen over the last decade in England. ""That's why we are raising awareness of the link between cancer and obesity and calling for measures to protect children, like a ban on junk food adverts before 9pm and for restrictions on price promotions of 'less healthy' products,"" Prof Bauld said. She said the decline in smoking was a cause for celebration.  ""It shows how decades of effort to raise awareness about the health risks plus strong political action including taxation, removing tobacco marketing and a ban on smoking in indoor public places, have paid off.  ""But, just as there is still more to do to support people to quit smoking, we also need to act now to halt the tide of weight-related cancers and ensure this projection never becomes a reality.""",,,,
1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45603569,"After being sent five hours from home for treatment for anorexia Cerys ""cried her eyes out the entire night"". The 18-year-old from south Wales was sent to London as her local hospital had no specialist facilities to deal with eating disorders. Since 2012, there has been an 8% rise in the number of children receiving mental health treatment outside Wales. The Welsh Government said it was often necessary for children to attend ""very specialist"" centres in England. Staff shortages have been identified as a major reason for the growing problem. An investigation by BBC's Panorama programme has raised major questions as to whether child and adolescent mental health services in Wales and England are fit for purpose. Cerys was a happy, outgoing child until she developed anxiety five years ago.  ""Things started to build up so I found myself feeling more uncomfortable in social situations and uncomfortable going out into public places,"" she said.  ""It got to the point where my anxiety was so overwhelming that I couldn't leave the house and I couldn't go to school."" She visited her GP three times before getting specialist help, by which point her illness had developed further.  ""I started to develop symptoms of OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder] and it was all to do with my fear of contamination,"" she said. ""I would spend my days cleaning the entire house. Not long after that I started to diet, but it developed into anorexia.  ""[My weight] was something I could control. Whereas I couldn't control these intrusive thoughts, focusing on the number going down on the scale gave me a distraction."" She was later admitted to the ward of a general hospital in Wales, but when they did not have the specialist facilities to deal with eating disorders, she was sent to London.  ""Obviously going to a psychiatric hospital in itself is really scary, then being five hours away from home is really scary,"" she said. ""Putting them both together is absolutely terrifying."" A report by the Children, Young People and Education Committee for the National Assembly for Wales, published in April, showed that the majority of those requiring highly specialist in-patient care still needed to travel to England to receive it.  It also highlighted an ""unacceptable gap"" in the provision of in-patient mental health services in north Wales due to recruitment challenges. South Wales Police have called for better mental health education in schools after a rise in young people being detained under the Mental Health Act. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring young people can access mental health services as close to home as possible.  ""However, on occasions care is provided at very specialist centres in England that provide services for the whole of the UK."" Dr Jon Goldin of the Royal College of Psychiatrists added that there is a problem across the UK with young people transitioning into adult mental health services upon turning 18.  ""Adult mental health services focus on adults with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major mental illness and young people often feel that that is not the kind of service they need,"" he said.  Cerys's initial request to transfer to adult services when she turned 18 was refused.  It was only when she was admitted to A&E that she was accepted.  ""I did fight. I said 'I don't feel well enough yet‚Ä¶ I want to go to adult services' but still it was a no,"" she said.  ""It was only after a few trips to A&E when they realised [I] do need adult services. ""Unfortunately it's another waiting list to actually receive the therapy. Who knows [how long that will take]. I'm just hoping it will be before university.""",,,,

Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez, went to the port of La Guaira to welcome the Chinese crew.  He said that the Peace Ark's visit was agreed by President Nicol√°s Maduro during a visit to Beijing last week.  Venezuela agreed at the time to increase its exports of oil to China, which is one of its main creditors.  Venezuela's economic crisis has led to severe shortages of food and medicines and the collapse of public services. The opposition says the presence of a Chinese hospital ship in Venezuela shows the extent of the humanitarian crisis.  Mr Padrino L√≥pez thanked China for the gesture of friendship and said that both countries would benefit.  ""It is a pleasure to have this ship in Venezuela, which has arrived here after travelling to more than 40 countries"" he said. ""This is how true diplomacy is done: with concrete cooperation actions,"" added Mr Padrino L√≥pez.  The Venezuelan government blames an international boycott led by the United States for Venezuela's economic crisis.  On Friday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo promised to unveil ""in the coming days"" a series of actions against ""Venezuelan leadership folks"". President Donald Trump has previously called President Maduro a dictator and accused his government of illegally detaining, beating up and killing opposition activists. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the country over the past year, as the crisis worsened.  According to United Nations figures, 2.3 million people left Venezuela between 2014 and June 2018. Mr Maduro travelled to China last week, looking for support to help rebuild the economy. He said he had signed 28 trade and investment deals with China. Venezuela said it would increase oil exports to 1 million barrels a day.  The two countries also agreed to invest $5bn (¬£3.8bn) to help rebuild Venezuela's ailing oil industry.  But there was no public statement from Beijing saying it had agreed to provide new funds to Mr Maduro's government.",,,,

The Faculty of Dental Surgery of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow wants excess sugar to be cut from school dinners. It said that about a third of children suffer from dental decay, while three in 10 are overweight or obese. Ministers say they will ""carefully consider"" the response to a consultation on the matter. The faculty wants to see puddings taken off school lunch menus and replaced with soup or fruit, and is opposed to the idea of including sugar-free drinks on the list of permitted drinks for secondary school. Faculty Dean, Prof Graham Ogden, said: ""We fully support the positive intention of these proposed regulations, but we feel that the Scottish government should take a bolder approach if it's to ensure that our young people have the healthiest possible start in life."" Prof Ogden added: ""For example, we all agree that children should have greater access to more fruit and vegetables as part of their school day, but increasing access does not necessarily increase consumption. ""The guidance must include an evidence-based plan to ensure any increase in provision also ensures that our young people consume larger amounts of healthier food during school meals. ""We also know that diet drinks cause dental erosion, in addition to being a gateway to sugar. We should aim to ensure that our children's oral health gets off to the best possible start in life."" The faculty, which represents more than 1,000 dentists and trainees, has also called for action to ensure that all children and young people have access to facilities in schools to brush their teeth after meals. The Scottish government said it would consider the faculty's comments along with other responses received to make school food and drink healthier. A spokesman said: ""We want to make sure every pupil is equipped with the skills, knowledge and experience they need to make better health choices and live longer, healthier lives. ""This commitment is supported by a package of measures including Curriculum for Excellence and Better Eating, Better Learning. ""Schools have a key role to play but it is vital that we all provide consistent messages to children and young people as they learn how to take responsibility for their own health and wellbeing.""",,,,

Experts say the device, which is placed below the injury, helps lost signals from the brain reach the leg muscles. US research teams at the University of Louisville and the Mayo Clinic, report the success in Nature Medicine and the New England Journal of Medicine.  One of the recipients says her life has been transformed by the technology. Kelly Thomas, 23, from Florida, is one of two patients at the University of Louisville who has been helped by the development, which has been combined with months of intense rehabilitation therapy.   She said: ""Being a participant in this study truly changed my life, as it has provided me with a hope that I didn't think was possible after my car accident. ""The first day I took steps on my own was an emotional milestone in my recovery that I'll never forget, as one minute I was walking with the trainer's assistance and while they stopped, I continued walking on my own. It's amazing what the human body can accomplish with help from research and technology."" Jeff Marquis, who was injured in a mountain-biking accident, has also benefited.  The 35-year-old is now able to walk for himself with support either from a frame or from people on either side of him holding his hands. A third patient, 29-year-old Jered Chinnock, was treated at the Mayo Clinic in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles.  He injured his spine in 2013 in a snowmobile accident. Since having the patch fitted he has been able to walk more than 100m with the support of a frame.  The patch does not repair the damage but circumvents it by stimulating nerves lower down in the spinal cord.  This appears to allow signals from the brain to reach the target muscles so the person can voluntarily control their own movements again.  When the stimulation was switched off again the conscious movement didn't happen.  Neurosurgeon Dr Kendall Lee, who co-led the team from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said: ""It's very exciting, but still very early in the research stage.""  Although there are many unanswered questions, including precisely how it works and who it might help, Dr Lee said: ""It gives hope to people faced with paralysis.""

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will examine measures such as age limits on purchasers and possibly ending over-the-counter sales. Experts say available evidence suggests more than half of patients with eating disorders have misused them.  Laxatives should never be used for weight control.  Medical professionals warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and imbalances that can lead to kidney failure.  But currently, unlimited quantities of laxatives can be bought without a prescription from pharmacies and supermarkets.  Rebecca Wojturska, 29 and from Fife, Scotland, says she bought and used laxatives for four years.  ""I was 19 when I first took them. My doctor had prescribed them as a two week course, but then I started buying them for myself. I was spending quite a lot of money every week on them.  ""I had an eating disorder and it was for about four years that I was abusing them."" She welcomes the idea of more safeguards, as does Rebecca Field, a spokeswoman for eating-disorders charity Beat: ""Just as painkillers are regulated to prevent people overusing them and harming their own health, there should be restrictions on the availability of laxatives.  ""It is vital that people are aware of the dangers of abusing laxatives and there should be more education on their effects.

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45638646,"Life expectancy in the UK has stopped improving for the first time since 1982, when figures began.  Women's life expectancy from birth remains 82.9 years and for men it is 79.2, the figures from the Office for National Statistics, for 2015-17, show.  In some parts of the UK, life expectancy has even decreased. For men and women in Scotland and Wales, it declined by more than a month. Men in Northern Ireland have seen a similar fall. For women in Northern Ireland, and for men and women in England, life expectancy at birth is unchanged. The ONS said the stalling of life expectancy was linked to a particularly high number of deaths from 2015 to 2017, which coincided with a bad flu season and excess winter deaths. It said there was ""much ongoing debate"" about the reasons behind this and what direction the trend may take in the future. It is not clear what is driving the trend, but some academics have argued that government austerity policies, such as cuts to social care budgets in England, must have played a part.  Ministers have said that no such causation can be proved, although Public Health England has been asked to carry out a review of life expectancy trends. Dr Kingsley Purdam, senior lecturer in social research methods and statistics at the University of Manchester, said the figures were ""shocking"".  ""Poverty, austerity and cuts to public services are impacting on how long people are living in the UK,"" he said.  ""We all need to look after our health but many of us, including the most vulnerable populations, need help at a time when evidence suggests that services are being cut. ""The lost years of life have an impact not just on the individual but on those people who are ultimately left behind including partners, children and grandchildren.""   But Prof Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said there were other factors that might explain the stall in progress. ""We still do not know how much this is a result of direct health effects such as flu epidemics, how much is a result of social and economic factors, and how much is a failure to go on improving smoking cessation or other preventive measures,"" he said. The data also shows that the UK lags behind other leading countries for life expectancy, including Switzerland, Japan, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. Of the countries the ONS compared the UK with, Switzerland was the nation with the longest life expectancy for men. For women, it is Japan. Men in Switzerland are expected to live to 81.5 years. Women in Japan are predicted to live to 87.  Throughout the 20th Century, the UK experienced steady improvements in life expectancy at birth, resulting in a larger and older population. This has been attributed to healthier lifestyles among the population as it ages, such as reduced smoking rates, and improvements in treating infectious illnesses and conditions such as heart disease.  But in recent years, the progress has slowed. And in the latest data it has ground to a halt.  The population of people who are 90 or over is still increasing but this is due to previous improvements in life expectancy going back many decades.  The number of centenarians decreased slightly between 2016 and 2017, reflecting low numbers of births during World War One.  But the ONS said it was expected to continue to increase again from 2019. By Robert Cuffe, BBC News head of statistics  Since the 1980s, life expectancy has been going up by roughly two months a year every year, as we saw fewer deaths due to smoking or heart problems.  But after 2011, that rate of improvement has been slowing.  It could be because it's hard to keep on improving every year. It could be because of hard winters or difficult flu seasons. But we're not sure about exactly what has caused this trend.  So this data is really telling us about death rates in the UK for the past three years.  And we can be sure that picture in death rates is real.  How sure can we be that you'll live as long as the ONS predicts? Not very - the ONS is not making precise predictions about what will happen in the future to determine how long you live.  Medical breakthroughs, pandemics and the wars of the next 80 years are impossible to predict.  A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""Recent trends in life expectancy and mortality in the UK can also be seen in a number of countries across Europe, North America and Australia.  ""As part of our long-term plan for the health service, we are taking action to help people live longer and healthier lives - cancer survival is at a record high while smoking rates are at an all-time low - backed by our additional funding of an extra ¬£20.5bn a year by 2023-24, which will transform care for cancer and other chronic diseases.""",,,,

The makers of the adrenaline injection pen, which is used to treat severe and life threatening allergic reactions, say the supply problems are due to manufacturing issues.   The Department of Health said they were working with the manufacturers to ""resolve the supply situation as quickly as possible"".  They said limited supplies were being closely managed. ""Any patient who is unable to obtain supplies should speak to their doctor about using an alternative adrenaline auto-injector device,"" said a government official. EpiPen is the biggest of the adrenaline auto-injectors on the market and shortages have had a knock-on effect, cutting into the stocks of other AAIs Jext and Emerade.  Jacqueline Scoins Cass has 10 allergies, including dairy, latex and coconut, for which she needs to carry EpiPens.  It is recommended that people carry two pens as the first one may not work on its own. Jacqueline managed to get one EpiPen in April and was told she would receive a second one soon after.  It arrived on Friday.  She said the six months' wait had been a ""worry"" but she knew she was better off than other people she talked to on allergy forums.  ""It's affecting people across the country,"" she said. ""People have been traipsing pharmacy to pharmacy to try and find them because they didn't even have the first pen - at least I knew I had one pen that was in date.  ""It would be really worrying if you didn't have any at all - out-of-date adrenaline is better than no adrenaline but obviously these pens have a shelf life for a reason.  ""I really feel for the people who haven't got one. ""It's a life-and-death medication.""  Robbie Turner, director of pharmacy at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, advises: The charity Anaphylaxis Campaign says anyone anxious about their prescription should visit their GP and talk about it directly with them. And do not dispose of any ""expired"" AAI devices before receiving a new one. Even if a device is out-of-date, as long as the liquid inside is not cloudy or discoloured it can still be used in an emergency.  Jacqueline had to wait a month last year for her second pen and hopes the issues will have been sorted out by the time she needs to replace them next time.  She said: ""Pens last a year or 18 months. So, if everyone's struggled to get them and they've all come in at a similar sort of time, they are all going to expire at the same time next year again. So, hopefully, they've future-planned that there's enough medication for then.""  The shortage has affected people in the US, Canada and Australia as well as the UK.

But an expert in metabolic medicine says more rigorous, targeted trials are needed to confirm evidence of the potential link. The findings, in Molecular Psychiatry, come from a review of 41 studies published within the last eight years.  A plant-based diet of fruit, veg, grains, fish, nuts and olive oil - but not too much meat or dairy - appeared to have benefits in terms of mood.  Experts say trials are now needed to test the theory and to learn whether depression can be treated with diet. Why are Mediterranean diets so healthy? Dr Camille Lasalle, who carried out the analysis with colleagues at University College London, said the evidence so far pointed to the idea that the foods we eat can make a difference in lowering our risk of depression, even though there is no solid clinical proof yet. Explaining the link between mood and food is tricky.  There are lots of other factors that may be involved. Without tightly controlled trials, it is unclear how big an impact following a Mediterranean diet might have.  Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, recommended ""a heavy dose of caution"". ""Whilst eating healthier is good for many reasons, we need more evidence before we can say plant-rich diets can improve mental health,"" he said. ""The only way to prove whether the links are genuine is to conduct large randomised trials in people at risk of depression. Such trials would take considerable effort but seem worthwhile to conduct."" Stephen Buckley, from mental-health charity Mind, said it was good advice to eat a healthy diet, get regular physical activity and cut down on ""mood-altering products, such as sugar, caffeine and alcohol"".  ""It's widely accepted that there's a strong connection between what we eat and how we feel, with blood-sugar levels affecting our mood and energy. ""If you are experiencing depression or anxiety, it might be hard to focus on your health, or you may resort to unhelpful coping strategies, such as drugs or alcohol.  ""If this is the case, you might benefit from other forms of treatment such as medication or talking therapies."" Research into the traditional Mediterranean diet has shown it may reduce our risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol, which are all risk factors for heart disease. Researchers have also found that people who closely follow a Mediterranean diet may live a longer life and be less likely to put on weight. A typical Mediterranean diet includes lots of vegetables, fruits, beans, cereals and cereal products, for example wholegrain bread, pasta and brown rice. It also contains moderate amounts of fish, white meat and some dairy produce. It is the combination of all these elements that seems to bring health benefits, but one of the key aspects is the inclusion of healthy fats.

Children aged eight to 11 who used screens for fun for less than two hours a day performed better in tests of mental ability, a study found.   Combining this with nine to 11 hours of sleep a night was found to be best for performance. Researchers said more work was now needed to better understand the effects of different types of screen use.  However, they acknowledge that their observational study shows only an association between screen time and cognition and cannot prove a causal link.  And it did not look at how children were using their screen time, be it to watch television, play videogames or use social media.    The study, of 4,500 US children, published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal, used questionnaires to estimate the child's: Children also completed a test, which assessed cognitive skills, including: The study controlled for: It found that children who each day had less than two hours of recreational screen time, got nine to 11 hours of sleep, and did at least one hour of physical activity performed better than who did none of these. Less than two hours of screen time a day was the one factor most linked to better performance in the test. Dr Jeremy Walsh, from the CHEO Research Institute, in Ottawa, Canada, said: ""Based on our findings, paediatricians, parents, educators, and policymakers should promote limiting recreational screen time and prioritising healthy sleep routines throughout childhood and adolescence."" Dr Walsh added that more research was now needed into the links between screen time and cognition, including studying the effects of different types of screen time. He said there was some evidence, for example, that video games and educational TV programmes might have cognitive benefits. In contrast, emerging evidence suggested the use of mobile devices and social media may be harmful for attention, memory and impulse control, he said.  However, the authors acknowledged there were limitations to their study, including that the data was self-reported.  The questionnaires were also only used only at the beginning of the study and so did not track how behaviours may change over time. Dr Kirsten Corder, senior investigator scientist at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said it added to existing evidence showing potential negative links with screen time and cognitive development in children. But she pointed out that the children may have struggled to answer the questions accurately.  Dr Corder also said further work was needed to develop more accurate ways to assess the effects of screen time in detail.

1808,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45664489,"Expectant mothers should be told that the risk of placenta complications rises after a caesarean or fertility treatment, according to top doctors. Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) guidelines said early diagnosis of conditions placenta praevia and placenta accreta was vital. They added doctors should discuss with women the safest way to give birth. The conditions can lead to heavy bleeding and sometimes put mother and baby's lives at risk. TV personality Kim Kardashian developed placenta accreta when pregnant with her daughter North West. TV presenter Amanda Holden suffered from the rare placenta praevia-accreta when expecting her youngest daughter Hollie. Placenta praevia happens when the placenta attaches in the lower part of the uterus (womb), sometimes completely covering the cervix (neck of the womb). Placenta accreta is a rare but serious condition when the placenta is stuck to the muscle of the womb and/or to nearby structures such as the bladder.  Both conditions can cause heavy bleeding, particularly towards the end of the pregnancy, because the placenta is low down in the uterus. This can sometimes require blood transfusions and lead to the loss of the uterus. The RCOG has produced an online leaflet with information for women who may develop or have these conditions. It says the rates of placenta praevia and placenta accreta have increased and are likely to continue to increase as a result of rising rates of caesarean births and the use of assisted reproductive technology, such as IVF. This is because potential scars in the uterus created by caesareans and fertility treatment mean any subsequent pregnancies are more likely to implant in the scar, causing problems with the placenta. The highest rates of complication for both mother and baby occur when these placenta complications are only diagnosed at delivery, the RCOG said. And it encouraged more scans and specialised care to help reduce any risks. Prof Eric Jauniaux, lead author of the guidelines, said: ""We hope this updated guidance will support healthcare professionals during discussions with women and their partners who may be considering assisted reproduction, particularly IVF, or an elective caesarean birth.   ""These are both risk factors that can increase risk of developing these serious complications of the placenta."" Prof Jauniaux, professor of obstetric and foetal medicine at University College London, said the guidelines should also help doctors to diagnose the complications early and discuss the safest way for women to give birth. Dr Geeta Kumar, chair of the RCOG patient information committee, said: ""It is important for women to be aware of these complications of the placenta, but they should be reassured that these are very rare and specialist care is available.  ""Early diagnosis is key to reduce harms associated with placenta praevia and accreta to ensure the safest possible outcome for mother and baby."" The placenta develops together with the baby in the uterus during pregnancy. It attaches to the wall of the uterus and provides a connection between mother and baby. Oxygen and nutrients pass from the woman's blood through the placenta and into the baby's blood. The placenta is delivered shortly after a baby is born, and is sometimes called the afterbirth. It is more common if a woman has had previous caesareans, fertility treatment or if they smoke. If you have placenta praevia, your baby will probably need to be born by caesarean. One in 200 women have the condition at the end of their pregnancy. It is a complication which affects between one in 300 and one in 2,000 pregnancies. This is more common if a woman has previously had a caesarean.  It may cause heavy bleeding at the time of birth. Vasa praevia is a very rare condition affecting between one in 1,200 and one in 5,000 pregnancies. It is where blood vessels travelling from your baby to your placenta, unprotected by placental tissue or the umbilical cord, pass near to the cervix.  If these blood vessels tear, this can be very dangerous for your baby.",,,,

""I went to my dentist, who thought it was an abscess,"" she says. It was two months before the 30-year-old found the cause, being diagnosed with bone cancer in August 2017, having attended hospital. ""I remember the consultant saying, 'Sorry,' many, many times, 'but it's cancer.'"" The chemotherapy began shortly after. ""My chemo was intense - Monday to Friday for three weeks in a row,"" she says. ""All my hair fell out in a week and I had a few scary things, like suspected heart attacks.""

""It's not just my jaw - it was behind my cheek up to my eye socket, the whole back of my nose, and also almost to the back of my skull,"" she says. Doctors used bone from her shoulder blade and muscle from her back to fashion a new roof for her mouth.  They also connected the reconstructed area with veins in her neck to give her a blood supply.

""I was pleased to be alive but there were times when I looked at myself in the mirror and found it so hard to deal with how I'd changed."" What did help, however, was that Jen documented her appearance over a period of two months - taking a photo every few days. ""If if it wasn't for the photos, I'd have despaired, thinking nothing was really improving,"" she says. ""What's been hard is the place where they took the cancer out has sunk quite a bit as the swelling has gone down - people ask me if I have a cleft palate.""

More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say. About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone. The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past. Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.

Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.

""Female doctors have up to four times the risk of suicide in comparison to people in the [general] population."" In 10 years, the PHP has helped more than 5,000 doctors, of whom slightly over two-thirds were women. The average age has dropped from 51.6 years to 38.9. But doctors can only self-refer if they work in London.  Other doctors can access the service, but they must do so via their local clinical commissioning group (CCG), thereby losing their anonymity.  The Samaritans is available 24 hours a day and calls are completely confidential. You can email jo@samaritans.org or call 116 123. HOPELineUK offer support, practical advice and information to young people considering suicide and advice if you are concerned about someone you know. Call 0800 068 41 41.

The BBC has details of more organisations that can offer support and information on emotional distress. In texts to her mother before she died, Sophie Spooner said she feared she would be sent into hospital if she revealed her mental health issues and her colleagues would find out. She also expressed her anger at not being able to access the PHP confidentially because she worked outside London. Dr Gerada says the lack of confidentiality is a barrier and wants NHS England to extend the London approach to any doctor who needs support. She believes acknowledging that doctors also have mental health problems is ""the last taboo in the NHS"". Louise Freeman, a consultant in emergency medicine, says she left her job after she felt she could not access appropriate support for her depression. ""On the surface you might think 'Oh, doctors will get great mental health care because they'll know who to go to'.  ""But actually we're kind of a hard-to-reach group. We can be quite worried about confidentiality,"" she said, adding that she believes doctors are afraid of coming forwards in case they lose their jobs. ""I was absolutely desperate to stay at work. I never wavered from that."" One of the biggest issues, according to Dr Gerada, is the effect on doctors of complaints from the public, which she says can ""shatter their sense of self"". Sophie Spooner's death came two months after a complaint was made against her. Nine months ago, consultant anaesthetist Richard Harding took his own life. A serious complaint had been made about him to the General Medical Council. He was eventually cleared but the process took five months. His wife Kate Harding, a GP, says it brought back depression he had not had for years.  ""Those five months just felt endless. Even after the complaint had been shelved, he was the type of person - afterwards - who questioned his decisions a lot more.  ""The effects are more long-lasting than you'd expect. I don't think it occurred to him to seek help."" Anna Rowland, assistant director of the GMC's fitness-to-practise department, said the organisation had made major reforms to its processes, with an emphasis on mental health, to ensure vulnerable doctors were identified and supported.  She said: ""We're committed to continuing this work, and we're also keen to influence the way wellbeing is approached by other healthcare leaders through independent research... health organisations must come together to tackle these important issues."" NHS England said in a statement: ""We launched the NHS GP Health service in 2017, a world-first, nationally funded confidential service which specialises in supporting GPs and trainee GPs experiencing mental ill health and which has already helped more than 1,500 GPs.   ""NHS Trusts and clinical commissioning groups may offer additional support for professionals in their area, for example CCGs in London have commissioned the NHS practitioner health programme for their staff."" But Dr Laurel Spooner says more support is needed. ""If we don't learn lessons from this, these deaths will go on happening,"" she says.

1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-45381947,"Scientists have used artificial intelligence to predict how cancers will progress and evolve. This could help doctors design the most effective treatment for each patient. A team led by the Institute of Cancer Research London (ICR) and the University of Edinburgh developed a new technique known as Revolver (Repeated Evolution of Cancer). This picks out patterns in DNA mutation within cancers and uses the information to forecast future genetic changes. The researchers said the ever-changing nature of tumours was one of the biggest challenges in treating cancer - with cancers often evolving to a drug-resistant form. However, if doctors can predict how a tumour will evolve, they could intervene earlier to stop cancer in its tracks before it has had a chance to evolve or develop resistance, increasing the patient's chances of survival. The team also found a link between certain sequences of repeated tumour mutations and survival outcome. This suggests that repeating patterns of DNA mutations could be used as an indicator of prognosis, helping to shape future treatment. For example, researchers found that breast tumours which had a sequence of errors in the genetic material that codes for the tumour-suppressing protein p53, followed by mutations in chromosome 8, survived less time than those with other similar trajectories of genetic changes. The research team developed a new machine learning technique which transfers knowledge about tumours across similar patients. This method identifies patterns in the order that genetic mutations occur in tumours that are repeated both within and between patients' tumours, applying one tumour's pattern of mutations to predict another's. Researchers used 768 tumour samples from 178 patients reported in previous studies for lung, breast, kidney and bowel cancer, and analysed the data within each cancer type respectively to accurately detect and compare changes in each tumour. By identifying repeating patterns and combining this with current knowledge of cancer biology and evolution, scientists could predict the future trajectory of tumour development. If tumours with certain patterns are found to develop resistance to a particular treatment, this novel methodology could be used to predict if patients will develop resistance in the future. The research is published in the journal Nature Methods. Dr Andrea Sottoriva, who led the study and is team leader in evolutionary genomics and modelling at the ICR, said: ""We've developed a powerful artificial intelligence tool which can make predictions about the future steps in the evolution of tumours based on certain patterns of mutation that have so far remained hidden within complex data sets. ""With this tool we hope to remove one of cancer's trump cards - the fact that it evolves unpredictably, without us knowing what is going to happen next. ""By giving us a peek into the future, we could potentially use this AI tool to intervene at an earlier stage, predicting cancer's next move."" ICR chief executive Professor Paul Workman said: ""Cancer evolution is the biggest challenge we face in creating treatments that will work more effectively for patients. ""If we are able to predict how a tumour will evolve, the treatment could be altered before adaptation and drug resistance ever occur, putting us one step ahead of the cancer. ""This new approach using AI could allow treatment to be personalised in a more detailed way and at an earlier stage than is currently possible, tailoring it to the characteristics of each individual tumour and to predictions of what that tumour will look like in the future.""",,,,

The procedure, bronchial thermoplasty, ""melts"" away excess muscle tissue in the lungs using radio frequency, making breathing easier. Previously there were strict criteria about who was eligible to receive it. But the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) says it can be offered more routinely, after it was proved to be safe and effective. Some people may still not be able to receive it because the final decision about whether to offer the procedure lies with local health bodies. Some 5.4 million people in the UK have asthma - but for more than 200,000 of them (3.7%) the asthma is so severe, it can be life-threatening. In fact, the most recent figures from Asthma UK show that 1,410 people died from asthma in 2016.  However, this ""life-changing"" treatment will be used only if a patient's symptoms cannot be adequately controlled with drugs, and is only suitable for adults. Joe Farrington-Douglas, the charity's head of policy and external affairs, said: ""This debilitating form of asthma is resistant to regular treatments, meaning many have to cope with terrifying asthma symptoms, such as gasping for breath, as well repeated trips to Accident & Emergency.  ""Until now, this treatment has only been available for specific patients at some specialist centres, but these new guidelines could mean more people with the condition could reap the benefits."" They might only happen when you react to a trigger, like pollen, dust, cigarette smoke, cold air or pets. Source: Asthma UK Severe asthma causes inflammation and constriction of the smooth muscle in the walls of the small tubes - the bronchi - impeding the passage of air through to the deep tissue of the lungs. Bronchial thermoplasty tackles this by reducing this muscle mass, thus decreasing the constriction of the bronchi that can take place during an asthma attack.  As a result, patients experience fewer and less severe asthma attacks. The procedure takes place under sedation or general anaesthetic and involves a wire probe being inserted into the lungs. Ten-second bursts of radio waves are sent along the airway wall, heating the lining of the lungs to 65C. Two further sessions will be needed, each three weeks apart.  The estimated cost of the procedure per patient is thought to be between ¬£7,099 and ¬£7,257. Nice's programme director and clinical adviser, Prof Kevin Harris, said: ""This is a procedure which is innovative and it does work. ""Asthma is a common disease and the vast majority of patients won't require this treatment.  ""But for people with severe asthma this procedure could be life-changing. ""The committee was convinced it was safe enough and works well enough for use with standard arrangements in the NHS."" Follow Laura on Twitter.",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45367980,"A mother of three died during ""Brazilian butt lift"" surgery in Turkey when a fat clot blocked one of her arteries, an inquest has found. Why is this procedure increasingly popular and is it more dangerous to have the operation abroad? Leah Cambridge, from Leeds, suffered a massive pulmonary embolism during the operation at a private hospital in Izmir in 2018, a coroner found. The 29-year-old beautician was undergoing a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) where fat from the stomach is injected into the buttocks. Ms Cambridge had opted for surgery abroad - which is often cheaper than in the UK - after growing paranoid about excess stomach fat after having children, her partner Mr Franks said. Her neighbours have described her as ""absolutely stunning"", adding that they believed she had gone to have the treatment against her partner's wishes. And Ms Cambridge is not the first British woman whose quest for the perfect behind ended in tragedy abroad. Joy Williams underwent buttock augmentation surgery in Bangkok, Thailand, in October 2014. Her wounds became infected, and the 24-year-old, from London, died under anaesthetic. Three years previously, 20-year-old Claudia Aderotimi, from Hackney, east London, died as a result of a botched ""buttock enhancement"" procedure at a US hotel.  The BBL procedure is not considered to be any more dangerous than many other types of cosmetic surgery, according to consultant plastic surgeon Bryan Mayou. ""The danger is the surgery being performed by unqualified surgeons outside a clinical setting without appropriate aftercare,"" says Mr Mayou, a member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. ""If fat is injected deep into muscle tissue and lower down on the buttocks, there is a risk of incorrectly injecting fat into large veins. ""The fat, now an embolus, can pass around the bloodstream, into the lungs and cause death."" Mr Franks, 31, told The Sun: ""Leah was under anaesthetic and complications happened due to fat getting deposited in her bloodstream and her oxygen levels fell. ""She was brought back to stable but had three heart attacks and there was nothing they could do."" Plastic surgeons from international societies have set up a taskforce to monitor and report on the BBL procedure, says Mr Mayou. The death rate following the procedure was found to be 1 in 3,000 and all the fatal cases investigated featured fat emboli being found in the buttock muscle, he says. The surgeon says he has noticed a rise in the number of bottom-boosting operations at his Cadogan Clinic in Chelsea, west London, in the past four years. ""It's a current fad,"" he explains. ""Years ago everyone wanted to be smaller and they would be saying 'can we have liposuction to make [my bottom] smaller?'"" And that is the technique that would be used if the ""bubble butt"" goes out of fashion and BBL patients want the procedure reversed, he says. So why the obsession with having a bigger behind? For Mr Mayou, it's down to popular culture celebrating curvier physiques. ""We live in an ethnically diverse world and there is an appreciation of different body shapes from our own, and then these techniques become available that make these shapes achievable."" Celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Cardi B have huge followings on social media where they regularly post photographs flaunting their rounded posteriors.  Jenner posted a video on her blog in which she attributed her curves to weight gain: ""[I haven't had] ass implants. You know, I used to be 120 [lbs]. I was really skinny. Now I'm pushing like 136. But it's alright, I like the chunkiness."" However, Cardi B has revealed that before she broke on to the music scene she had filler injected into her buttocks in a basement in New York - and the silicone leaked for five days afterwards. In an interview with GQ, she said she paid $800 (¬£564) for the procedure after seeing her stripper colleagues with bigger bottoms earning more than her. Chloe Simms, a star of reality soap The Only Way Is Essex, has been open about the bum-boosting cosmetic surgery she's had, having complained on the show that she had ""the flattest bum in Essex"". This Instagram post from 2013 shows her slim silhouette.   While she appears much more curvaceous in this swimwear shot from July 2018. And as Mr Mayou points out, BBL surgery can be a particularly attractive idea for some women as it's seen as being able to solve two body hang-ups in one go. ""For a lot of people you are really getting two benefits from one operation - removing fat from somewhere they don't want it and putting it somewhere they do,"" he says. In terms of cost, cosmetic surgery is cheaper in countries like Turkey than in the UK, Mr Mayou says.  He estimates a BBL procedure would cost about ¬£8,000 in the UK. Some reports state Ms Cambridge paid as little as ¬£3,000 for her surgery. ""But we have people travelling from abroad to our clinics in London because our surgeons are qualified, regulated - our clinics are safe - so it's a two-way thing,"" he says. ""I think people are being enticed by heavy marketing; it's all in a foreign language and they have no way of checking if the surgeons are safe,"" Mr Mayou adds. ""It's a commercial enterprise and they are not going to turn down people. They will do everyone whether they are suitable for the operation or not. ""By making the decision to undergo cut-price surgery, patients risk serious complications and even - as this tragic story illustrates - death.""

1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45395576,"Public Health England is urging people over 30 to take an online test to find out their heart age, which indicates if they are at increased risk of suffering a heart attack or a stroke.  They predict about 80% of heart attacks and strokes in people under 75 could be prevented if heart health was improved. Unhealthy lifestyles put four in five adults at risk of early death, they estimate. People should quit smoking, eat a healthy diet and get enough exercise. The test is not diagnostic - it will not tell you whether you are going to have a heart attack - but it can be a wake-up call to make healthy changes. David Green, who is 59, took the test.   ""The worst moment was being told my heart is 10 years older than me and that my life expectancy was shortened,"" he told the BBC.  ""That took some digesting for sure, but I flipped it to a positive statement to do something to reverse that scenario.""  David took the test after he struggled to keep up with rehearsals for his role in The Full Monty with his local theatre company in Plymouth.  He had never heard of heart age, but said he would have guessed he was only a few years off.  ""I'm 59 now so I thought 'oh maybe it'll be 62 or 63', so a whole 10 years - that was a real shocker. ""They told me that 'you really need to do something otherwise you're not going to see that much of your pension'.  ""I think that was the main thing for me, I'd just retired, I'd like to live a bit longer thank you very much.""  Obesity, poor diet, a lack of exercise and high blood pressure are significant risk factors for the heart that can be changed. Source: NHS Choices Almost two million people have taken the heart age test and 78% of participants have a heart age higher than their actual age, putting them at greater risk of an early death. Of those, 34% were more than five years over their actual age and 14% at least 10 years higher. More than 84,000 people die from a heart attack or stroke each year in England.  Dr Matt Kearney, from NHS England, said the test has the ""potential to help millions of people"". The test is being backed by the British Heart Foundation and the Stroke Association. Juliet Bouverie, chief executive at the Stroke Association, said: ""We believe that across the UK there are around six million people who are undiagnosed and untreated for high blood pressure or atrial fibrillation, two of the biggest risk factors for stroke.  ""However, treatment for these conditions can significantly reduce your risk of stroke and the devastation it causes.""  The test asks 16 simple physical and lifestyle questions and gives an estimation of your heart age, and a prediction of the risk of having a heart attack or stroke by a certain age.  It also gives suggestions on lifestyle changes to help people reduce their heart age.   David joined the gym, cut down on his alcohol intake and is eating much more healthily. He says taking control of his health and knowing what he's dealing with is very satisfying and empowering.   So far David has lost two stone and his BMI has come down by six points. ""I want to have a long and happy and healthy retirement and that's what it's about now - I've worked for 40 years continuously and I want to be enjoying things, I don't want to be hobbling around on a stick, which I could have easily been doing by now.  ""I know when I've had those temptations to have an extra pint of beer or glass of wine I know I've got to do something about that as a forfeit - it's good, it's an empowering thing to do.""  Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at British Heart Foundation, said: ""The goal of the Heart Age Tool is not to diagnose any heart conditions but to make people more aware of risks to their heart health and give them the incentive to make simple lifestyle changes.   ""If you are concerned about your heart age, you should speak to your GP.""",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45394620,"Doctors are being told to adopt a new policy of writing letters that are easier for patients to understand.  The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges says too often correspondence contains complex medical jargon rather than plain and simple English.  Using the phrase ""twice daily"" to explain the dosing of a medicine is better than the Latin abbreviation ""bd"", for example. Patients should ask their local hospital to comply, the academy says. The Please Write to Me initiative is aimed mainly at doctors working in outpatient clinics, although it is best practice for all clinicians who need to write clinical letters.  Doctors are being asked to write directly to patients, rather than sending them a copy of a letter penned to their GP.  The academy says this should help avoid blunders or offence caused by writing about patients in the third person.  It cites the example of a surgeon branded sexist after praising a father for ""manfully stepping in"" to take his daughter to a hospital appointment when his wife was too ill.  Another consideration is the tone of the letter. A familiar style, such as: ""It was a pleasure to meet you and your husband for the first time,"" might sometimes be appropriate - but at other times a more distant or formal style might be appreciated, say the guidelines.  Doctors are asked to avoid potentially stigmatising words: ""'You have diabetes,' is better than 'You are diabetic.'"" They should think about softening the impact of potentially sensitive information by using a more non-committal style, as with: ""During the examination, the tremor and stiffness in your right arm suggest that you have Parkinson's disease."" And any medical words should be translated in plain English. For example: Hospital doctors should also consider telephoning the patients rather than breaking bad news in the letter if test results are potentially upsetting, the academy says. The initiative is being led by Dr Hugh Rayner, a kidney specialist, who first started writing directly to patients in 2005.  He said: ""The change may seem small but it has a big effect.  ""Writing to patients rather than about them changes the relationship between doctor and patient.  ""It involves them more in their care and leads to all sorts of benefits.  ""Millions of clinic letters are written every month in the NHS so this change could have a big impact."" The Royal College of GPs is also on board. Vice-chair Prof Kamila Hawthorne said: ""I have seen a number of patients who have asked me to 'translate' the letter they have received from the hospital, which has been little more than a medical summary. ""By hospital doctors writing any letters directly to patients, with their GP copied in so we are always aware of what is happening regarding our patient's care, it should make the process more patient-centred, and make them feel more involved in their care, which will be beneficial for everyone.""",,,,

They're sitting in the sunshine of the memorial garden at the hospice where Abigail spent many happy hours.  Ty Hafan's children's hospice, just along the coast from Barry Island in south Wales, holds a special place in their hearts. And now, as part of a remarkable new sound installation, the names of more than 300 children who were cared for there will be celebrated in the form of birdsong.   Abigail had mucolipidosis type 2, an extremely rare, life-limiting disorder and died at the hospice when she was 10. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, her mum, Pauline Harvey, says: ""Ty Hafan was the only place we could be together as a family, outside of our home and the hospital, because Abigail had such a severe disability."" The hospice has always remembered children who have died by painting a pebble with their name on it, but now they are using Morse code and birdsong to do something special for hundreds of families. ""We knew from the parents that hearing their child's name is very, very important, so we found a really creative way to link those children's names into a very natural feeling of the birdsong in the environment,"" Tracy Jones, head of community services and partnerships, explains. The hospice is working with sound artist Justin Wiggan, who takes the name of the child, puts it into a Morse code translator and then samples birdsong around it. Justin says it's been an emotional process. ""I don't think you can create work like this without being connected with the people and families - I am a father myself so I can identify with some of the age ranges. The first few times it is quite overwhelming."" He has a detailed way of choosing which bird should sing each child's name. ""I started to look at a calendar that I found in an old book in a charity shop, showing which birds sing the strongest during the month that the child died. ""From talking to parents and just seeing how at times the child was a lot stronger than the parents, this carried through to a concept that the bird chosen for the child should be the one that sings the strongest during the month that the child died.""  And he has what he admits is a romantic hope that wild birds in the garden will, in time, mimic the sounds. Pauline says Abigail would have been delighted with the concept. ""She was so happy, and such a big personality that she would love the idea of having her name sung across the skies - she would absolutely have adored that idea."" Abigail's name has been turned into the birdsong of a robin, which Pauline says is very appropriate. ""The robin is one of her favourite birds, such a lively, stroppy, opinionated little bird, it's very emotional."" And hearing it played out in the garden for the first time? She takes a deep breath, then smiles. ""It sort of knocked me off my feet a little bit. I think what I'm hit with is a wall of memories."" Abigail's dad Stephen agrees. ""It's a fairly small bird, and Abigail was small for her age, she was probably the size of a two-year-old. She was extremely feisty, it just brings a lot of emotions and thoughts back."" Abigail's sister Jennifer, 11, was seven when her sister died. ""It's one of those birds that will not be forgotten, you will always know what it is, and Abigail will not be forgotten at any time."" The Harvey family will also be playing out the recording on a speaker in their own garden.  For Jennifer, having the birdsong at home will be a comfort. ""When I wake up in the morning and go outside. Just to hear that, that would cheer me up a lot.""

1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45408017,"Very little progress has been made in reducing levels of inactivity worldwide, experts have warned. A WHO report estimates that more than a quarter of people worldwide - 1.4 billion - are not doing enough physical exercise, a figure that has barely improved since 2001. Inactivity raises the risk of a raft of health problems, such as heart disease, type-2 diabetes and some cancers. High-income countries, including the UK, were among the least active. And women were found to be more sedentary throughout the world, with the exception of two regions of Asia.  Researchers from the World Health Organization (WHO) looked at self-reported data on activity from 358 population-based surveys in 168 countries, including 1.9 million people, for their study in The Lancet Global Health. They found in high-income countries, which include the UK and the USA, the proportion of inactive people had risen from 32% in 2001 to 37% in 2016, while in low-income countries it had remained stable at 16%. Those who were classed as inactive did less than 150 minutes of moderate exercise - or 75 minutes at a vigorous intensity - a week. Countries driving the upwards trend included Germany, New Zealand and the US. Women were less active than men in all but East and South-East Asia, with the biggest differences being in South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, north Africa and high-income Western countries. The authors said this was likely to have been caused by a combination of factors, including extra childcare duties and cultural attitudes that made it harder for them to exercise. In the UK, inactivity levels in 2016 were 36% overall - 32% of men and 40% of women. Experts said the transition in wealthier countries towards more sedentary jobs and hobbies, along with increased use of motor transport, might explain their higher levels of inactivity.  In lower-income countries people are more likely to be active in their jobs and walk or use public transport. The report's authors warned that as things stood the WHO's 2025 target of reducing global inactivity by 10% would be missed. Dr Regina Guthold, lead author of the study from the WHO, said: ""Unlike other major global health risks, levels of insufficient physical activity are not falling worldwide, on average, and over a quarter of all adults are not reaching the recommended levels of physical activity for good health. ""Regions with increasing levels of insufficient physical activity are a major concern for public health and the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases."" Co-author Dr Fiona Bull, also from the WHO, said: ""Addressing these inequalities in physical activity levels between men and women will be critical to achieving global activity targets and will require interventions to promote and improve women's access to opportunities that are safe, affordable and culturally acceptable.""

Dr Melody Ding, from the University of Sydney, who was not involved in the study, said that while economic development led to lifestyle changes that increased sedentary behaviour, governments could do more to help people be more active, such as improving public transport and making it easier to walk and cycle.

1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45409471,"There has been an explosion in interest in veganism, in recent years, driven largely by concerns about health, animal welfare and the environment.   Vegans, for the uninitiated, do not eat meat, poultry, fish, or any products derived from animals, including eggs, dairy products, and gelatin. There are now four times as many vegans in the UK as there were four years ago.  So how hard is it to convert, and what are the potential health benefits? Veganism: Why is it on the up? Why I gave up being vegan Going vegan: Is it just a fad? What does a healthy vegan diet look like? For the latest series of Trust Me I'm A Doctor, Dr Giles Yeo decided to try it for a month and see if it was a lifestyle he could imagine adopting.  As Dr Yeo quickly discovered, one of the tricky things about going vegan is that many products that don't sound as if they have anything to do with animals actually do.  Eggs, cheese and meat are obvious no-nos but so is mayonnaise (contains eggs), some pastas (ditto), and wine (some alcoholic drinks use fish bones or proteins from other animals as part of the production process).  As well as making sure you are not accidentally consuming animal products, one of the main challenges of going vegan is to make sure you're not missing out on any key nutrients. Following a vegan diet puts you at risk of getting insufficient vitamin D, which is needed for bone health.  To get this through diet, vegans may need to rely on fortified foods, including some types of soy milk, rice milk, organic orange juice, and breakfast cereals.   You may also want to consider taking a vitamin D supplement. Iodine deficiency is very common in the UK, particularly among young women.  Cow's milk is our main source of iodine and non-dairy alternatives, such as almond milk, have much lower levels. You can get iodine from seaweed (though the amounts are unpredictable) but you will probably need to take a supplement. The other big concern is getting enough vitamin B12. You won't find it in seeds, nuts or vegetables, so vegans and vegetarians will need to stock up with fortified breakfast cereal or nutritional yeast. Will going vegan make you healthier? A recent analysis, which pulled together the results of 10 previous studies comparing the health of vegetarian and vegans against that of omnivores, suggests it will. The researchers found being a vegetarian or vegan was associated with a significantly lower risk of heart disease and cancer, though there was no difference in all-cause mortality.  In other words, being a vegetarian or vegan was associated with being healthier but not necessarily with living longer.  I say ""associated with"" because these were not the gold standard randomised controlled studies, where you take a large group of people and randomly allocate them to being vegan or omnivorous and see what happens. Such studies would be very hard to do. Instead, they compare people who are vegans with meat eaters and look for differences.  Since vegans are likely to be more health conscious than the general population, it is possible that the health differences have nothing to do with the diet itself.   So how did Dr Yeo get on? After being vegan for a month he had lost 4kg and brought in his belt by a notch. Along with the fall in his belly fat, his cholesterol also fell by 12%.  So will he keep it up? ""I've been pleasantly surprised,"" he said, ""and though I don't plan to go vegan entirely, from now on I'll try and do at least a few days every month. ""I have to admit I was apprehensive about going vegan for a month, but once I learned a few recipes I was fine and I actually ended up enjoying it.

Some big chains like McDonalds and Wetherspoons already print the calories of dishes on their menus. The Department of Health wants to make it a legal requirement as part of its childhood obesity strategy. But the Treasury has said small independent cafes and restaurants should be exempt from the move. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss has said the policy would be a burden on 26,000 small businesses and could lead to job cuts. The Treasury estimates that working out the precise calorie count of individual dishes could cost up to ¬£500 and menus would have to be reprinted when recipes changed, adding further costs. The Federation of Small Businesses said it would like to see more flexibility for its members in recognition of the fact that smaller operators would find it much harder to absorb the costs involved.  ""Businesses will have to spend hundreds to work out a precise calorie count and when recipes change, which could well incur additional costs unless regulations are written with small business in mind,"" said the organisation's chairman Mike Cherry. The Department of Health and Social Care is set to launch a consultation on the plans and has said exempting small restaurants will be considered as part of that. A spokesman for the department said: ""The government announced its intention to consult on mandatory calorie labelling on menus as part of the second chapter of the childhood obesity plan in July and we will set out our next steps in due course."" Ms Truss has written to Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, Theresa May's de facto second-in-command, to express her concerns.  In the letter, leaked to The Daily Telegraph, she says: ""At this stage I am not agreeing to any preferred or final policy change for small or micro businesses. ""We should take a final decision following this consultation and informed by the evidence submitted to it. ""HM Treasury clearance is required for government's response to this consultation."" Ministers have also been warned that requiring restaurants to include calorie counts on menus could cause added distress to people with eating disorders. Beat, a charity that supports people with eating disorders, said research indicated the number of calories someone consumed was not a reliable indicator of their health.   ""Evidence shows that calorie labelling exacerbates eating disorders of all kinds,"" said the organisation's chief executive, Andrew Radford.  ""Public health campaigns need to consider people's mental health as well as their physical health.  ""They must move away from obesity shaming to emphasising healthy behavioural changes and instilling confidence into people.""",,,,

The gesture happened last week but has been shared publicly in a Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) Facebook post. They said paramedics had acted after learning their patient, Ron McCartney, 72, had eaten little in previous days. ""The officers asked Ron, if you could eat anything... what would it be?"" the post by QAS said. ""To which Ron replied, a caramel sundae."" The ambulance service said it had been left ""humbled and tinged with sadness"" after receiving a message of gratitude from Mr McCartney's wife, Sharon. His daughter, Danielle Smith, said that her father had died on Saturday in palliative care, following a 17-year fight with pancreatic cancer. Ms Smith told the BBC that her family was grateful for the kindness and quality of care given to her father.  Earlier, she wrote on Facebook: ""Dad enjoyed this so much and [it] was the last thing he was able to eat by himself. ""Mum and I cannot thank QAS enough for all the help and compassion you have all given towards us."" The state ambulance service received similar praise last year after it fulfilled a dying woman's request to visit the beach for the last time. In its post about Mr McCartney on Tuesday, the ambulance service said its gesture underlined ""an often-unseen aspect of patient care; the caring"". The post has drawn hundreds of supportive messages from the public. ""Something so simple can have a huge impact on people who need it the most,"" one commenter said.

Their study is among the most detailed analyses of what happens when we consume probiotics.  They are seen as healthy and good for the gut, but the results found they had little or no effect inside the body.  The researchers said probiotics of the future would need tailoring to the needs of each individual.  The team at the Weizmann Institute of Science made their own probiotic cocktail using 11 common good bacteria including strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. It was given to 25 healthy volunteers for a month. They were then sedated and samples were surgically taken from multiple places in the stomach and small and large intestines.  The researchers were looking to see where bacteria successfully colonised and whether they led to any changes in the activity of the gut.  The results in the journal Cell, showed in half of cases the good bacteria went in the mouth and straight out the other end.  In the rest, they lingered briefly before being crowded out by our existing microbes.  More than half your body is not human Gut Instinct: Why I put my poo in the post Does vaginal seeding boost health? Why a faecal transplant could save your life How bacteria are changing your mood Trillions of bacteria call the lining of our guts home and everyone has a different mix of microbial inhabitants.  Dr Eran Elinav said it was wrong to expect an off-the-shelf probiotic to work for everyone. He says that in the future probiotics will need to be tailored to the needs of individual patients.  He told the BBC: ""And in that sense just buying probiotics at the supermarket without any tailoring, without any adjustment to the host, at least in part of the population, is quite useless."" The research group also looked at the impact of probiotics after a course of antibiotics, which wipe out both good and bad bacteria.  Their trial on 46 people, also in the journal Cell, showed it led to delays in the normal healthy bacteria re-establishing themselves.  Dr Elinav added: ""Contrary to the current dogma that probiotics are harmless and benefit everyone, these results reveal a new potential adverse side effect of probiotic use with antibiotics that might even bring long-term consequences."" There have been some proven benefits of probiotics, notably in protecting premature babies from necrotising enterocolitis. And there remains great hope within science that understanding the complex relationship between the microbial and human parts of our body will lead to new treatments.  However, Dr Trevor Lawley, a microbiome researcher at the Sanger Institute, said he was not surprised by the findings.  He told the BBC: ""Probiotics have been around for a long time and they're coming under more scrutiny. ""These are very innovative studies, but they are preliminary findings that need replicating. ""The gut has a natural property to stop colonisation, as it usually blocks pathogens, and that is something we have to outmanoeuvre."" Follow James on Twitter.",,,,

""Aged seven I got a migraine during my parents' wedding. I was the flower girl and it ruined the whole weekend.  ""Ever since then I've been anxious about attacks in important moments and it's a vicious cycle, as stress and anxiety increase the likelihood of having a migraine. ""In a way, the migraines are almost psychological, although unfortunately they manifest physically,"" she says.  Yasmin sufferers from migraines three to four times a month. Her attacks last around three days and she describes the pain as like being shot in the head.  Invariably she vomits, fluid comes from her nose, and she has sensitivity to light and sound. It's completely debilitating.  Last year, during her graduation, the fear and anxiety prompted another attack.  ""It came on during the night before. I woke up at 04:00 in a lot of pain.  ""Four years ago I was finally prescribed medication after years of suffering, so I took those meds, and I was able to get some relief for a couple of hours.  ""There are side effects from the meds, but at least I can just about function. I continued to take the meds throughout the day and I was able to complete my graduation, but that worry is always there.  ""I travel quite often, and I am always scared that I will get a migraine on a plane.  ""Migraines have ruined some of the best moments of my life."" Yasmin's experience chimes with the results of a new survey of 690 migraine sufferers in the UK, which showed that more than two-thirds of them live in fear of an attack.  Nichola West, a mother of three from Bath, also suffers from anxiety about getting a migraine, as she actually loses her vision for about 20 to 30 minutes before a headache starts.  ""I get migraines with aura, which is where I lose my eyesight, or it gets very blurry. It's a horrible sensation. The first one I had was when I was pregnant with my youngest son. ""I had to go to hospital, they didn't know if I was having a stroke. ""I'm always on edge, because if one comes on, I can't see, the lack of vision lasts for about 20 to 40 minutes.

""I've had to talk to my children about what to do if I get an attack,"" Nichola told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. The survey, conducted for drug company Novartis between September 2017 and February 2018, analysed data from sufferers who had four or more migraine attacks a month.  It found that in the UK, 71% of people have to rely on external support to cope with everyday tasks.

1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45446439,"A new campaign is urging people between the ages of 45 and 65 to have regular ""drink-free"" days. Middle-aged drinkers are more likely than any other age group to drink more than the recommended 14 units a week.  A YouGov poll also suggests they find cutting back on alcohol far harder than eating healthily or exercising. Doctors say ""drink-free"" days will improve sleep, help with weight loss and reduce the risk of high blood pressure and cancer. Dr Julia Verne, a spokeswoman on liver disease for Public Health England, said: ""Having a day off drinking gives you a chance to clean your system and give your liver a rest.  ""It also has an immediate impact on your sleep and calorie consumption.  ""People have also told us that the idea of a 'drink-free' day is much easier to manage than cutting down, say, from one large glass of wine to a small glass of wine.""  The campaign, Drink Free Days, is a partnership between Public Health England and the alcohol education charity Drinkaware.  The YouGov poll - by PHE and Drinkaware - surveyed nearly 9,000 18- to 85-year-olds during May and June this year.  It found that one in five was drinking more than the government's 14 unit-a-week guidelines. And two-thirds said they would find cutting down on their drinking harder to do than improving their diet, exercising more or reducing their smoking.  Dr Verne said: ""Most middle-aged people are not drinking to become drunk.  ""They see it as a social activity, or as a reward for success or compensation for a hard day at work.  ""It's become a habit and part of their lives.  ""But the more you drink, the more you increase your risk of high blood pressure, heart and liver disease and cancer.   ""Ultimately you are more likely to cut down if you have some days off drinking.""  She also pointed out that many people in this demographic were struggling with their weight and didn't realise how many calories were contained in alcohol.  In 2016, the government cut the alcohol limits it recommended for men and women to 14 units a week - six pints of average-strength beer or seven glasses of wine. But more recently a global study by the Lancet indicated there was no safe level of alcohol consumption, although the risks associated with two units a day were small.",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45419545,"There is an urgent need to tackle a decline in male fertility and address the ""absurd"" reliance on giving female partners expensive and invasive IVF treatments to try to overcome the man's lack of quality sperm, a leading fertility expert has said. For men, being told you are infertile can be a crushing and lonely experience. Male infertility is now the most common reason for couples in the UK to seek IVF - but when Craig Franklin was told bluntly that he had no sperm, he felt alone and emasculated. ""The GP essentially said, 'You're producing no sperm, you won't be able to have children. Out the door, away you go,'"" the 39-year-old explains. ""There was no support whatsoever."" The effects hit him hard and almost led to him breaking up with his partner Katie. ""I was very angry for a long time. I went mad with money,"" he tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""My performance at work deteriorated quite significantly to the point that I lost my job late last year."" ""It broke my heart. I saw a man break, basically,"" says Katie. ""He didn't feel like a man, and that's so unfair."" Leading fertility expert Prof Sheena Lewis - chairwoman of the British Andrology Society that aims to improve care in men's reproductive health - says the lack of focus on male infertility within the health system is an ""urgent"" problem. ""Men are not being looked after properly, not diagnosed, and not cared for,"" she says. The quality of men's sperm in the Western world is in decline, but little is known about how to improve it - and there are few treatments available on the NHS. This has led to an ""absurd"" case, says Prof Lewis, where women routinely have to undergo IVF - even if there is nothing wrong with their own fertility. ""The woman actually acts as the therapy for the man's problem [of poor sperm],"" she says. ""We are giving an invasive procedure to a person who doesn't need it, in order to treat another person. That doesn't happen in any other branch of medicine."" Prof Lewis adds that it is also a ""huge expense for the NHS"", at a time when IVF is being rationed in many parts of the country. One couple, who spoke to the Victoria Derbyshire programme anonymously, might never have had their son had they not explored other options privately. On the NHS, they were given a round of IVF - despite the female partner having good fertility - but it failed due to the man's poor sperm. ""It was really unpleasant. Injecting yourself with needles that don't go in the first time is not a walk in the park,"" she explains. So instead, the man sought the help of a private clinic and had an operation - cheaper than a round of IVF - to treat varicocele, an abnormality in the scrotum that affects up to 40% of men with fertility problems. His wife conceived naturally. For Stephen Harbottle, a consultant clinical scientist who helped develop the fertility guidelines for health watchdog NICE, while varicocele treatment will not work for every man, the NHS must ensure other options are explored before IVF is offered to a couple. This includes simple solutions such as dietary supplements, or tests to check for sperm DNA damage. The reason this does not happen currently, he says, is that ""doctors don't have any other options available other than to refer patients for IVF"". ""Men in some ways are just being farmed through the system,"" he adds. Some men with fertility problems also report feeling sidelined by GPs, who they say focus on the women. Mark Harper - from Ilkeston in Derbyshire - has two children through donor sperm. But when he was originally found to have no sperm, it was his wife whom the doctor called with the news rather than him.  ""If you're talking to a male about his infertility problems, you ought to be talking to the male about it,"" he says. ""I'm here, I'm a person, I was the one sitting in front of you, and I'm the one you need to be talking to."" The Royal College of GPs said in a statement that its members were ""highly trained to have sensitive, non-judgemental conversations with all our patients... including why someone might have problems with their fertility and the best options for them going forward"". Prof Sheena Lewis says the lack of attention on male fertility also means men are not educated on their reproductive health, and may wrongly take it for granted. ""Men do have a biological clock. As time goes on, because of their lifestyle, there are more and more opportunities for mutations to occur in their sperm. ""Men who are over 45 when they have children are more likely to have children who will have childhood cancers, or may have psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder or autism,"" she says, adding that she believes this is also likely to be the case for younger men with poor sperm quality. Katie and Craig say doctors presumed the reason they were not able to conceive was because of Katie - and she was tested before Craig's fertility was ever considered. The couple are now looking for donor sperm privately, having been denied IVF on the NHS. The stigma surrounding male infertility means this is the first time Craig has ever spoken openly about the issue - until now, even his friends did not know. ""It's not a manly thing to discuss,"" he says. ""It's boxed up... and not spoken about."" The couple say it took them a year-and-a-half to come to terms with not being able to have children without donor sperm - made worse by the fact emotional support was never offered to them. But now they are coming through it. ""We're stronger than ever,"" Katie says. ""But other couples might not be as strong as us. They might not be able to work through that and I can see why - it's so hard for the man to be able to come to terms with not being able to give his wife a child.""

Tanzania has a population of around 53 million people, with 49% of them living on less than $2 (¬£1.50) a day. On average, a woman in Tanzania has more than five children, among the highest rates in the world. The day after Mr Magufuli's comments, speaker of parliament Job Ndugai banned female lawmakers from wearing fake nails and eye-lashes in parliament.

Female visitors to parliament will also be expected to adhere to the dress code. Mr Magufuli made his comments at a rally on Sunday in the northern Meatu district, saying people who use family planning methods were lazy, the local Citizen newspaper quoted him as saying.  ""They do not want to work hard to feed a large family. And that is why they opt for births controls and end up with one or two children only,"" he said. ""I have travelled to Europe and elsewhere and have seen the harmful effects of birth control. Some countries are now facing declining population growth."" Mr Mwambe said that if President Magufuli wanted his comments to be taken seriously, he should change the health insurance scheme to cover 10 children instead of the current four per family, the Citizen reports. The paper however said that there was no indication that the country's population policy would change following the remarks. Mr Magufuli made similar comments in 2016. After the launch of free primary and secondary education, he said: ""Women can now throw away their contraceptives. Education is now free.""

Only half of those who had experienced problems with stress, anxiety or low mood had talked to their employer about it.  That's something that must change, says Mind.  Fear, shame and job insecurity are some of the reasons people may choose to hide their worries. Natalie Hunt, 34, from Salford, got her first job at 18. That role was working in a department store, serving customers, but she found it extremely stressful.  ""It was dealing with complaints and helping people with queries. I'd had anxiety and depression as a teenager and the full-time job made me really anxious. I began to get shy and withdrawn, going more and more into myself, and I was worried about having a panic attack at work. ""Colleagues started to notice and eventually my boss wanted a word."" Natalie says that at the time, her employer didn't really understand or know what to do. There was no support. She then left the workplace altogether and took up an art course at college.  She now teaches art classes to people with mental health problems, and at a homeless shelter. She also works part-time in an office, even though sometimes she can go through stages of poor mental health.  Natalie says it makes a huge difference when the workplace is supportive - they have flexible hours and regular catch-ups. ""I first started back in the workplace with a bit of voluntary work in a charity shop, which was great. Because it was voluntary and part-time, I didn't feel pressured and it helped me regain some confidence. That was when I was 20.

Mind says around 300,000 people lose their job each year due to a mental health problem. The charity - along with The Royal Foundation, Heads Together and 11 other organisations - has created an online resource for employers and employees with information, advice, resources and training that workplaces can use to improve wellbeing.  A recent poll by the Institute of Directors found less than one in five firms offered mental health training for managers.

And nearly 151 million under-fives - 22% of the global total - have their growth stunted by poor nutrition.  The authors say extreme climate events are partly to blame for the rise and call for urgent global action. The report, The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, also says difficulties accessing nutritious food is contributing to the growing problem of obesity in the world, with one in eight adults  - more than 672 million - being classified as obese.  The authors note the frequency of extreme climate events - floods, heat, storms and droughts - has doubled since the early 1990s.  And they say: ""The report sends a clear message that climate variability and exposure to more complex, frequent and intense climate extremes are threatening to erode and even reverse the gains made in ending hunger and malnutrition."" Climate extremes have a direct impact on crop yields and food availability but can also reduce: And hunger is significantly worse in countries where agricultural systems are sensitive to variations in rainfall and temperature and where many people depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.  The authors say: ""Climate variability and extremes - in addition to conflict and violence in this part of the world - are a key driver behind the recent rises in global hunger and one of the leading causes of severe food crises."" And they call for coordinated global and local action so countries become more resilient to climate-related disasters.  Commenting on the report, Robin Willoughby, from Oxfam, said: ""It is shocking that after a prolonged decline, this is the third consecutive year of rising hunger.

The letter, released on World Suicide Prevention Day, has been backed by mental health charities and high-profile figures like Stephen Fry.  In 2015, comedy writer Jack Rooke found out how his friend Olly killed himself by reading the details online.  ""It was just placed there - right in the middle of this online copy - and it was just horrendous,"" Jack tells Newsbeat. He's now an ambassador for the mental health charity, The Campaign Against Living Miserably. ""It's a really brutal, cruel thing for anybody to have to have gone through.

""We need to have a media which is far more ethical and actual doesn't sensationalise or, in the worst case scenario, glamourise young suicide,"" he says. The charity Samaritans has a set of reporting guidelines for the media when reporting suicide. These specifically ask journalists to think about the effect of the reporting on audiences - and warn against going into details like the ones Jack read.

It has compiled what it calls ""the most comprehensive picture"" of the nation's current health and future fitness.  It shows England's population is growing in size and people are living longer but not all in good health. While smoking rates may be decreasing, diabetes, obesity, dementia and mental health issues are on the rise. The Health Profile for England report shows average life expectancy has reached 79.6 years for men and 83.2 for women. In 2017, there were 1.35 million people aged 85 and over in England - nearly three times more than in 1971. By 2031, it could exceed two million, says Public Health England. But the number of years that people live in poor health is also going up. Latest data suggests people can expect to live about 63 years in good health.  That means men face about 16 years of ill health - a fifth of their life - and women more than 19 years or nearly a quarter of their life in poor health.  Age-related diseases, such as dementia, have been increasing.  Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, is already the leading cause of death in women and it looks set to overtake heart disease to soon become the biggest killer of men too. Hearing loss, sight loss and muscle and joint problems have also gone up. But heart attacks and strokes have gone down, as blood pressure and cholesterol levels have improved.  Obesity and smoking are the two leading risk factors for ill health.  While smoking rates have been going down, rates of obesity have been going up. In 2016, one in four adults was obese - and Public Health England expects levels of adult obesity may continue to rise. The number of people with diabetes is also rising and is expected to increase by a million to reach almost five million in 2035. Poor mental health is also taking a significant toll. In young people, mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, along with substance use, now account for a third of all ill health.  Inequalities in the health of the population also persist.  People in the richest areas of England enjoy more than 19 years more good health than those in the poorest. Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England, said: ""The challenge now is for the NHS to respond to this changing landscape and to focus on preventing as well as treating the conditions which are causing the greatest disease burden across our nation. ""In many ways it needs to respond more quickly than any time in its history because the speed of the change in these data, in the epidemiology, is really quite remarkable."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: ""As this report shows, there are a number of reasons why some people are more likely to develop these conditions than others, including genetic predisposition and socio-economic factors - but there remains a clear connection between the quality of our patients' lifestyle and their overall health.  ""It's so encouraging to see that smoking prevalence has dropped to just 15% over the last seven years, for example, but the chances of people developing illnesses like diabetes is still worryingly high and frequently is the result of poor diet and lack of exercise as well as genetic factors."" She called for more investment to help the NHS deliver the care patients needed and deserved.",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45482204,"Clinics must make it clear that there is little point in women over 40 freezing their eggs, because the odds of a future pregnancy are very slim, says UK fertility regulator the HFEA. Fertility declines with age, so the optimum time for egg freezing is before a woman turns 35, it says. Yet data shows that the most common age at which women are treated is 38, with many freezing eggs into their 40s.  NHS clinics usually have a younger cut-off age, but private ones may not.  Women can only get egg freezing on the NHS if it is for medical reasons, such as needing a cancer treatment which may cause them later fertility problems. Private clinics also offer it to women who want it for social reasons, like delaying starting a family because they haven't met the right partner yet.  In 2016, 80% of the 1,310 freezing procedures carried out were done in private clinics,  Around 890 of all the treatments were for women aged 35 and over, compared with 419 treatments for women younger than this.  The HFEA says it is not clear why patients of this age are freezing eggs. Most women freezing eggs using NHS funding were aged below 35, with 89% below 38. It says women must be given clear information about the risks, costs and likely success rates of egg freezing, which is becoming an increasingly popular ""fertility insurance"" back-up plan.  Egg freezing costs anywhere between ¬£2,720 and ¬£3,920 per go.  Most clinics will include a couple of years of storage in that price, but there may be an extra annual charge of up to ¬£350 for that service.  The complete cost if you then opt to thaw and use your eggs in a future treatment, is ¬£7,000 to ¬£8,000.  Birth rates from frozen own eggs are increasing but remain below that of conventional IVF treatment cycles, being successful one in every five times, on average, compared to around one in three for ""fresh egg"" IVF.  While a woman's age at thaw has relatively little impact on a woman's chances of success, the age at freeze does, with evidence suggesting that if eggs are frozen below the age of 35, the chances of success will be higher than the natural conception rate as the woman gets older, says the HFEA.  HFEA Chair Sally Cheshire said: ""Clinics have an ethical responsibility to be clear that egg freezing below the age of 35 offers women their best chance of creating their much longed-for family."" Aileen Feeney from Fertility Network said women should know their fertility ""vital statistics"" 28:35:42: ""By 28, female fertility has already begun to fall; 35, female fertility plummets; 42, your chance of becoming a biological mother is vanishingly small."" Prof Simon Fishel, from the independent IVF provider CARE Fertility Group, said women face a hard choice, knowing that if they freeze eggs early they can still only be stored for 10 years.",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45497304,"There will be 18.1 million new cases of cancer and 9.6 million people will die with the disease this year worldwide, a report predicts.  The rise, from 14.1 million cases and 8.2 million deaths in 2012, is partly due to a growing and ageing population.  The figures suggest one in five men and one in six women will develop the disease in their lifetime.  And as countries become wealthier, more people get cancers related to lifestyle rather than those linked to poverty.  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) provides regular snapshots of the scale of cancer around the world, looking closely at 36 different cancers in 185 countries.  Researchers say while ways of measuring and collecting cancer data have improved over the years, the overall trend is that cancer rates and deaths have risen year on year.  The latest report suggests lung cancer, female breast cancer, and bowel cancer are responsible for a third of all cancer cases and deaths worldwide.  And the authors say lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in women in 28 countries.  The worst hit countries include the USA, Hungary, Denmark, China and New Zealand.  George Butterworth, from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: ""Tobacco is the single biggest reason why more women across the world are getting lung cancer than ever before.  ""In the UK smoking among women became more prolific later than it did for men, so it's not surprising that we're seeing increasing lung cancer rates now.  ""Similarly, cigarettes are now increasingly popular among women in low and middle income countries and the tobacco industry's aggressive marketing to them is influencing this."" Meanwhile, Dr Freddie Bray, of the IARC, said: ""The results highlight the need to continue to put in place targeted and effective tobacco control policies in every country in the world.""  Overall, the report estimates, nearly half of all cases and most cancer deaths in the world this year will occur in Asia, partly because of the large numbers of people living in the continent and partly because some cancers with higher death rates are more common in this region.   This includes, for example, high rates of liver cancer, which generally has a poor prognosis, in China. Beyond this, the authors say, there is ""extraordinary diversity"" in the types of cancer and patterns of illness around the world. They say because of this countries need to consider tailoring how they try to prevent and treat cancer.",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45498024,"High levels of shame and ignorance are associated with HPV, the sexually-transmitted virus which affects 80% of people, a survey has discovered.  The government is rolling out HPV testing as part of routine screenings for cervical cancer.  Nearly half of the women surveyed believed their partner must have cheated if they had HPV, but the virus can remain dormant for years.  Campaigners fear women may not attend screenings because of the stigma.  The survey of 2,000 women was done by Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust last month.  It found that half of the women were embarrassed and ""put off sex"" as a result of contracting the virus.  Around 35% of the women had no idea what HPV is, and nearly 60% said they thought it meant they had cancer.  Laura Flaherty, 31, who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016, is typical of the respondents.  ""When I first saw on my letter that I had been diagnosed as being HPV positive, I didn't know what it was. When I Googled it I discovered it was a sexually transmitted infection, so I automatically thought my partner had been cheating.  ""I knew nothing about it, and it felt dirty. I didn't realise it could lay dormant for so long and when I realised how common HPV is I was shocked. No-one I spoke to had heard of it, yet most of us are going to contract it.""  Myth: You can only get the virus through sexual intercourse  Fact: HPV is usually sexually transmitted, but it can also be transmitted by any skin-to-skin contact in the genital and oral areas  Myth: HPV is a sign of being promiscuous  Fact: 80% of us will contract HPV virus at some point in our lives, it's easy to get and pass on and you can get it the first time you have any sexual contact. Myth: HPV means I've got cancer  Fact: There are about 200 types of HPV. About 40 types affect the genital area, simply meaning they will live there, a few can cause unpleasant but harmless conditions like genital warts. Around 13 high-risk types can cause cervical cancer and other cancers of the genitals as well as mouth and throat cancer, but this is rare.  Myth: You'll know if you have HPV Fact: HPV is symptomless and in most cases the immune system will clear the infection. Cervical screening picks up any abnormal cells  Source: Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust The survey comes as a government initiative to test for HPV first in cervical screening, before other conditions, starts in Wales next week. It will roll out to England by 2019 and be implemented in Scotland in 2020, but there is no date for its introduction in Northern Ireland. The change means that more women will be told that they have HPV.   Robert Music, Chief Executive, Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said: ""Testing for HPV first is a far more effective way of identifying those most at risk of cervical cancer. This change to the programme does mean more women will be told they have HPV.  ""HPV can be confusing however, so we must normalise it to ensure people don't feel ashamed or scared about being told they have the virus."" HPV infection is rapidly declining in girls aged between 12 and 18 as a result of the HPV vaccine introduced in 2008.  Last year, the vaccine was extended to gay men aged 16 to 45, and in July the government announced that it will also be extended to boys, although no start date has yet been given.  There are no plans to extend the HPV vaccine to other adults over the age of 18, as the likelihood of already having the infection are high, and therefore the vaccine would be ineffective. Dr Philippa Kaye, GP and author said: ""GPs and health professionals will be having more conversations with patients about HPV as they come in to discuss their results. Understanding how it is transmitted and the relative risks will help reduce the stigma surrounding it.""",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45498914,"Rachel Day's mum Bernie had been trying to get hold of her all morning. When she finally did, instead of relief all she felt was terror. Her daughter was screaming uncontrollably and begging for help. As Bernie rushed to help, not knowing what she would find, 29-year-old Rachel was rapidly succumbing to sepsis as it ravaged her body.  Days later, Rachel was dead. On World Sepsis Day, Bernie, from Cardiff, tells Rachel's story. It was during lunch with my husband that I first knew something terrible was wrong.   I had texted Rachel that morning, but she hadn't replied.  Feeling uneasy, I rang her.  But when she answered, it was a noise I will never forget.  She was screaming uncontrollably at me, screaming in pain, screaming for me to get there.  I sped to her flat, keeping her on loudspeaker as I drove.  But when I got there, I was greeted by a terrifying sight.  Rachel was lying in bed, unable to move. Her mouth was blue and her legs were mottled and swollen, spasming with cramp.  ""Don't worry, my darling,"" I said, desperately trying to reassure her as she screamed in pain. ""We'll get you help. You'll be okay.""  But in reality, I was already too late. She was in septic shock and she was dying. I just didn't know it yet.  It was a situation made all the more impossible by the fact my daughter had been so healthy.  Rachel loved sport and fitness, and for a long time had worked as lifeguard and swimming teacher at Llanishen Leisure Centre, before becoming assistant manager. There, she mentored younger staff and made friends with her sunny personality and strong work ethic.  She was beautiful, in the bloom of her life, excited about a business idea to change her career path and open a creche for dogs.  But that weekend - the second May bank holiday in 2017 - she fell ill. It came on so quickly. Just the day before, we had been out together, enjoying a boat trip around Cardiff Bay then going on to drink cocktails. She lived with a close friend and I know that on the Sunday, she had gone to bed earlier than usual, complaining she felt unwell.  At 4am on the Monday morning, she had knocked on her flatmates' door, asking her to take her to A&E. She was vomiting and complained of feeling breathless. She told her flatmate she was frightened she was going to die - a common symptom of sepsis as it takes over the body so quickly.  Her flatmate did all she could - driving her straight to A&E at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. She was told there was a five-and-a-half hour wait to see a doctor, and that she might be best going home and taking Paracetamol.  Rachel followed the advice and went home to bed.  But at 7am, her flatmate left for work, reluctantly leaving her alone with just a sick bucket and a glass of water.  Like me, she texted throughout the morning to check Rachel was okay.  Like me, she didn't receive a reply.  It was only when I phoned, and Rachel managed through her pain to tap the screen to answer that we knew the horror that had engulfed her.  New guidelines for managing sepsis say it needs to be treated with intravenous antibiotics within the hour.  But we were already way behind.  It had consumed her, constricting her movements as it began ravaging her internal organs and tissue, leaving her in extraordinary pain.  The following sequence will be etched forever on my mind.    At first, despite the urgency of my 999 call, just one paramedic came to her flat.  He sent for an ambulance and two more paramedics arrived.  Rachel was still screaming in pain, and they couldn't even find her blood pressure, it was so low.  It was one hour and 20 minutes before she reached A&E - despite it being just a few miles away.   As we drove there, I was screaming inside my head for them to hurry.  It was only as we neared hospital that the word sepsis was first mentioned. Sepsis, I thought. What was sepsis?  But it was clear that the doctors and nurses on the Intensive Care Unit knew.  As soon as Rachel arrived, she was attached up to one drip and another, pumped full of antibiotics and fluids.  A consultant told Rachel she was going to be put under sedation to give her body a rest.  She reassured her she wouldn't die but, in reality, doctors probably knew she would be lucky if she lasted 24 hours. In fact, Rachel lasted 10 days in intensive care. She fought and fought.  But it was now 12 hours after she had first attended A&E with symptoms and the sepsis was in full control.  She had blood clots on her lungs, brain and kidneys. Her body was swollen, her beautiful face and nose disintegrating and turning black. After six days in an induced coma, she was slowly brought back round by doctors, so they could assess what damage had been done to her brain.  Rachel couldn't talk but she could communicate through blinking - one for yes, two for no.  She recognised the voices of close friends, blinking when they sang her funny Dr Dre songs.   I would sing to her in my terrible voice, mainly lyrics from the Carpenters' hit Close to You, which I had sung to her since she was a baby.  Needless to say, she blinked twice. Shut up, mum, she was saying. Stop singing.  She still had her sense of humour and we thought that night that she might just make it.  And on the following Sunday - day seven - we held out even more hope when she opened her eyes for her dad. But her body was too tired to do it more than once, and she was put back under sedation.  It was the next day, on Monday, 5 June, that consultants broke the news to us that in order to save her life, they would need to amputate her limbs.  They wanted to take both legs under the knee and her left arm.  Although horrific, it was our view that she would be able to cope with this. Before surgery, the doctors let me slide onto her bed and give her a cwtch [hug].  But when the surgeon came to talk to us afterwards, he told us the damage to her tissues had been so severe, they had had to amputate both of her arms, leaving her a quadruple amputee.  To say we were distraught is not touching it. How would Rachel cope like that? What sort of life would she have?  It was at this point I went to the chapel in the hospital.  I was screaming at God, asking why this had happened to Rachel and not me. I walked to the window, shaking violently and wanting to throw myself out.  But the chaplain must have heard me. She rushed in, wrapped a blanket around my shoulders and calmed me down.  She told me I was a mum, and as a mum, I knew what I had to do.  But then there came the final blow, delivered by a consultant in tears.  Rachel had multiple-organ failure. She wasn't going to make it anyway.   We invited all her friends to the hospital, let people say goodbye, put candles around her room, then switched off her life-support machine. This was Wednesday, 7 June 2017, and my beautiful girl was gone in minutes.  That was 16 months ago. More than 400 people came to her funeral.  Obviously, we have questions about Rachel's death. Could an earlier diagnosis have saved her?   But for now, our family is focusing on campaigning to make people more aware of sepsis.  The illness kills upwards of 44,000 people in the UK - more than bowel, breast and prostate cancer combined. The money we have raised has gone towards implementing a 'Sepsis 6 Pathway' at the University Hospital of Wales. This means anyone admitted with a fever or signs of infection will be checked against red-flag symptoms of sepsis.  We are now hoping to train paramedics and GPs to spot early warning signs, as well as getting the pathway into more hospitals.  Of course, we are also focusing on getting Rachel's story out there to the wider public.  I don't want to let her down.  If she died to save others, then I have to do what I can to get the message out there. Sepsis is triggered by infections, but is actually a problem with our own immune system going into overdrive. It starts with an infection that can come from anywhere - even a contaminated cut or insect bite. Normally, your immune system kicks in to fight the infection and stop it spreading.  But if the infection manages to spread quickly round the body, then the immune system will launch a massive immune res",,,,

""No-one trains us for what is essentially a military operation managing our kids and food - they go through phases of hating and loving different foods, because their taste buds and brains are evolving. ""Every one of my five kids has reacted differently. Some will taste things, some you have to disguise it.  ""Little River won't eat fruit whole, you have to lose it in a thick smoothie. But at least I get it in there, right? It's all about ducking and diving."" Jamie Oliver has had to do quite a bit of his trademark ducking and diving of late. He recently revealed that he was forced to inject nearly ¬£13 million of his own money to save his restaurant chain - Jamie's Italian - from bankruptcy, as well as closing 12 restaurants and making hundreds of staff redundant.  And on the day we meet, Jamie has hit the headlines again - this time as a hero for fighting off an intruder to his Highgate home. Jamie is here to talk to the BBC about what feels like a personal and professional fightback: a healthy eating partnership with Tesco.  In the past he's been criticised by those who say healthy food is unaffordable for people on a low income.   Research by The Food Foundation found that almost half of UK households can't spend enough to meet the government's recommended Eat Well Guide.  Yet this time Jamie is ready for his critics: ""Too often the rhetoric about healthy eating gets focused on affordability. Well that's important and Tesco will be reducing the cost of a basket of healthy swaps by 12%.  ""People don't want to be lectured about healthy eating. There's so much guilt involved in being a modern parent, and being a parent today is not the same as it was 20 years go. ""Mum and Dad are both mainly working, they are time-poor, and there's the mortgage. It needs to be affordable. But nevertheless the supermarket can make a difference. It has a role to play in the rhythm of most people's lives."" This week the government begins consultation on some of the measures it set out in its childhood obesity strategy in July; these include tighter restrictions on junk food advertising, banning sweets at checkouts and calorie labelling on restaurant menus.  The measures are a response to soaring levels of childhood obesity, with one in three children now overweight or obese.  Most controversial is the government's plan to force all restaurants to publish calorie counts on menus.  The Treasury says it is worried that this will push up prices and lead to thousands of job losses.  Jamie Oliver thinks the measure will hurt small businesses.  ""If you're talking about places like Pr√™t a Manger or Itsu, the grab-and-go places, I think that people would love clarity on calories. But for smaller independent places where they change the menus regularly, well they are not going to have the resources to give that nutritional information.""  Instead, he says, people should take charge at home.  ""For example, your average Briton has about a 16 gram fibre deficit, so just swapping white bread for brown is going to make a difference.  ""At the weekends I batch cook. Yes it might be 15-20 minutes work, but then you're making 15-20 portions, and you've got a two minute healthy solution during the week that is full of love and the good stuff. It's much more cost effective.""  Can Jamie Oliver make a difference? The CEO of market research company, Ipsos Mori, Ben Page said: ""I wouldn't say it's a slam dunk. Obviously I love Jamie, like the rest of us do, but generally we advise clients that celebrities are not big purchase drivers. That said, Jamie is aligned with healthy eating and has spent years talking about it. Plus, it's the general direction of travel. """,,,,

The thin spike that went through Xavier Cunningham's head ""miraculously"" missed his eyes, brain, spinal cord and major blood vessels. He fell down from a tree house when the freak accident occurred on Saturday. Kansas University Hospital told local media he is expected to recover fully, although his voice may be affected.  A team of Kansas University doctors successfully removed the square rod - which made for a trickier surgery than a rounded skewer due to the sharp edges - over several hours. Xavier was playing in a tree house at his home in Harrisonville, Missouri, when yellow jacket wasps began stinging him.  He fell from the tree house and landed directly on a foot-long (30cm) metal meat skewer. The skewer penetrated around six inches into the boys skull. Xavier's mother Gabrielle Miller told Kansas City Star that she saw her son walk into the house, screaming, with the rod ""just sticking out"" of his head. ""I'm dying Mom, I can feel it,"" Mrs Miller recalled him telling her on the way to hospital. Xavier was taken to local hospital, transferred to hospital in Kansas City and again transferred to the University of Kansas hospital where he would eventually undergo surgery. His injury had no active bleeding and had avoided his eyes, brainstem, spinal cord and blood vessels, which enabled doctors to call in expert surgeons before attempting the removal surgery on Sunday morning. Koji Ebersole, director of endovascular neurosurgery at the University of Kansas Health System, told the Star: ""You couldn't draw it up any better. It was one in a million for it to pass 5 or 6 inches through the front of the face to the back and not have hit these things."" He said the biggest concern while removing the rod was the blood vessels in the boy's neck. Dr Ebersole called the boy's recovery ""miraculous"".

1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45487187,"Jumping into the sea in winter is the most alive and present I ever feel. I get in fast - a dangerous approach if you're a beginner - when the cold shock response provokes an uncontrollable urge to inhale.  Underwater, I feel an intense mixture of burning pain and, even after doing this for years, a little panic. But it's the only time the anxious negative chatter in my head is truly silenced.  After two minutes, as my skin reaches the same temperature as the water, I start to feel comfortable and my breathing slows. After even a brief swim, I feel elated for hours and calm for days.  Like many other people who swim in cold water regularly, I love it, but I also believe it has mental health benefits.  And the first case report on cold water swimming published in British Medical Journal Case Reports shows that it may be an effective treatment for depression. The Doctor Who Gave Up Drugs, a series broadcast on BBC One in 2016, which I developed and presented, followed Sarah, a 24-year-old who had been taking antidepressants since the age of 17. Her symptoms had started earlier in her teens. When we met, she was desperate to stop her antidepressants, saying they put her in a ""chemical fog"".  She loved swimming and, because of my own experience, I approached Prof Mike Tipton and Dr Heather Massey, both scientists at the extreme environments laboratory at Portsmouth University. I also spoke to their collaborator Dr Mark Harper, a consultant anaesthetist at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, to see if there was any scientific basis for trying out cold water swimming on Sarah.  Outdoor exercise and the companionship of fellow swimmers can improve symptoms of depression and anxiety. But the team at Portsmouth believed there might be an effect of cold water immersion itself.  There is a convincing, biologically plausible, theory about how this might work.  Immersion in cold water evokes a stress response: a set of physiological and hormonal reactions that evolved millions of years ago to cope with a wide range of potential threats.  Animal attack, jumping in cold water and sitting an exam all elicit a similar response.  Heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate all increase and stress hormones are released.  But, if you immerse yourself only a few times in water of 15C or less, this stress response is reduced.  However, it is not only the stress response to cold water that reduces with repeated immersions.  Check out the The Outdoor Swimming Society website for safety advice and more.  Prof Tipton and Dr Massey have shown that the response to the stress of exercising at altitude is also diminished.  This is called ""cross-adaptation"", where one form of stress adapts the body for another.  There is increasing evidence linking depression and anxiety with the inflammation that accompanies a chronic stress response to the physical and psychological problems of modern life.  Through cross-adaptation, cold water swimming may be able to reduce this chronic stress response together with the inflammation and mental health problems that affect so many of us.  The theory is sound, but the evidence it works is all anecdotal, apart from this case report.  Cold water swimmers describe many benefits: they never get colds and never turn the heating on in winter. Many have stories of how they came to outdoor swimming in times of grief or bereavement and found comfort, even joy, in the water.  The team at Portsmouth are starting to test these stories. A preliminary study supports the claims made about colds and further reports are being prepared about patients with a range of conditions.  Since 2006, prescriptions of antidepressants have more than doubled and, while patients may take these drugs for many years, there is debate about their effectiveness.  New approaches which attempt to tackle the multiple causes of depression are badly needed.  Dr Mark Harper is cautiously optimistic. He says: ""Our observations so far support the hypothesis that cold water swimming may have a range of benefits."" More than two years later, Sarah is still swimming and off all medication.  ""Life is good. I still have counselling but the swimming is something I'll never turn my back on,"" she says.  ""It helped me so much in a time of need."" Do not stop antidepressants or any other medication without discussion with your prescriber first.",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45520784,"Zimbabwe has launched a crowdfunding campaign to deal with an outbreak of cholera that has so far killed 25 people, mostly in the capital, Harare. New Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube sent an appeal on Twitter, sharing a mobile payment account number. An emergency has been declared and public gatherings banned in Harare to prevent the spread of infection. Some Zimbabweans have criticised the fundraising plan on Twitter, accusing the state of misusing public money. In 2008, a cholera outbreak killed some 4,000 people and at least 100,000 people fell ill. This was a key factor in persuading President Robert Mugabe to agree a power-sharing government with the opposition, as the government did not have the money to deal with the outbreak. The current outbreak began on 6 September after water wells were contaminated with sewage in Harare. Tests found the presence of cholera and typhoid-causing bacteria which has so far infected over 3,000 people, Health Minister Obadiah Moyo told reporters on Thursday.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), patients were not responding to first-line antibiotics.  ""Relevant medicines should be purchased as a matter of urgency as soon as resistance patterns have been ascertained,"" it said. WHO also said the disease has spread to five of the country's 10 provinces. The health emergency has forced the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to postpone this weekend's mock inauguration of its leader, Nelson Chamisa, as president.  Mr Chamisa has refused to back down from his claim that he won the 30 July election, even after the Constitutional Court dismissed his legal challenge against President Emmerson Mnangagwa's victory. The police had earlier withdrawn their permission for it go ahead, citing the ban on public gatherings imposed because of the cholera outbreak. His party now says the swearing in will be held at a ""later date"". The cholera outbreak can be traced to Harare city council's struggle to supply water to some suburbs for more than a decade, forcing residents to rely on water from open wells and community boreholes, according to Reuters news agency.  Health officials are advising people to wash their hands regularly, drink only safe water, wash food, cook it thoroughly and avoid shaking hands. The government-controlled Herald reports that the crowdfunding campaign has already received some backers including telecommunication giant Econet Wireless, which has contributed $10m (¬£7m). The Zimbabwe Red Cross Society has launched its own appeal. Mr Ncube's plan has been condemned on social media: Lawyer Fadzayi Mahere wanted to remind newly elected President Emmerson Mnangagwa of his campaign promise:  This user saw the campaign as another ploy from the political class: While Twitter user Bruce Zvandasara said it was more worthwhile than the opposition's call for funds to pay for their legal challenge to Mr Mnangagwa's July election victory: This Twitter user wondered why the government had the money to charter a private plane to bring back former first lady Grace Mugabe from Singapore when her mother died, but does not have funds to deal with a public health emergency: Correction 19 September 2018: This story was amended to say that the Zimbabwe Red Cross has set up its own cholera appeal rather than contributing to the crowdfunding scheme.",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45496654,"Uganda is the most physically active nation in the world, according to a recent report by the World Health Organization. The BBC's Patience Atuhaire went to find out why.  Jennifer Namulembwa spends an hour-and-a-half walking to work, five days a week. From Namuwongo on the south-eastern end of Uganda's capital, Kampala, she navigates her way past the railway line and crosses the treacherous eight-lane stretch of the highway.  She skirts the plush Kololo hill, finally getting to Kamwokya suburb by 9am.  At work, the 34-year-old spends two hours on her feet, cleaning a three-floor building.  The rest of her day is spent running errands for her boss. And just after 5pm, she traces the same route, to return home. ""I'm used to it so I don't feel the distance. I never wear nice shoes to work. I would also like to enjoy the good life sometimes; ride in a car or on a motorcycle,"" she chuckles, showing her dusty feet in black sandals. Her commute is not dictated by the size of her body, but that of her wallet.  Her salary is just over $100 (¬£70) a month. Domestic needs and her two children's education burn through it, so she can't afford to pay for transport. At 7am, the sun casts long shadows of the many people trekking along the railway line.  Along the same route walks father-of-three Oprus Aduba, a hotel worker. Wiping sweat off his brow, he too says that the numbers have failed to add up. The World Health Organization report on physical activity, which categorized Uganda as one of the most active countries in the world, probably had people like them in mind. The study, tracking the level of physical activity around the world, found that only 5.5% of Ugandans had an insufficient level of activity. Mozambique, Tanzania, Lesotho and Togo too are also doing quite well.  In comparison, people in Kuwait, American Samoa, Saudi Arabia and Iraq seem to be living highly sedentary lives. About a quarter of the world's population don't get enough exercise. The research findings note that, generally, people in low-income countries seem to integrate a sufficient amount of physical activity in their lifestyles, unlike those in wealthier countries.  The poorer people are, the more likely they are to use modes of transport, or be in an occupation, that involve physical work. However, the study, an analysis of self-reported national data, doesn't explain why Ugandans are more active than other countries with a similar level of income. Even in low-income countries, more people are getting into formal employment, spending long hours at the office, buying cars and eating more fast food, meaning Uganda might become less healthy as they become wealthier. The two Kampala walkers are not even aware of the WHO-recommended 150 minutes of moderate-to-intense or 75 minutes of rigorous activity per week.  They easily surpass the target without trying. How much? What is moderate aerobic activity? What counts as vigorous activity? What activities strengthen muscles? What activities are both aerobic and muscle-strengthening? Source: NHS  Away from the city to rural Uganda, where an estimated 70% of the population work in agriculture, the study findings ring very true.  It seems that nothing keeps one in shape better than a hoe. Abiasali Nsereko, a 68-year-old farmer in Luweero, about two hours north of Kampala, starts his day at 5am. Having finished milking the cows, real work starts.  It could be cleaning the cow shed, tending to the coffee bushes or the banana trees.  He works his 10-acre farm by himself, with the occasional hired labour. ""I spend about eight hours on my feet, six days a week. I grow all the food that we eat. If I stopped working, I would probably fall sick. At my age, I do not have a single ache in my body,"" he says.  But it is not easy for those Ugandans trying to stay fit as their lifestyles change. Kampala is not a fitness-friendly city. There are hardly any green parks, most roads have no pavements, and many cars emit the same amount of fumes as a grass hut on fire. Walking or jogging demands some bravery. If you are lucky to find a walkway, you have to watch out for open manholes, and boda bodas (motorcycle taxis), which will push you off the pavement and top it off with insults.  Motorists will not be shy to drive you into the storm-drain, in which you have to jump over plastic bags that look very suspiciously like ""flying toilets"". Still, over the last couple of years, joggers, mostly the urban elite, have increasingly appeared on the streets.  There is also a growing trend of fitness groups around the city. On a sunny Saturday morning, three different groups work out in the parking lot of Mandela National Stadium, Namboole.  From people in their 60s to a nine-year old girl, they go through their jumps, squats and stretches. To an outsider it may look like a fad, but Diana Nakabugo tells me that the group has kept her motivation up.  She's at the stadium from 6.30am three times a week, for an hour's work-out.  But it is a struggle. The pressures of a working life do not leave much room for recreational physical activity. Ms Nakabugo says: ""I wake up with traffic jam on my mind. You have to drop the kids at school, and then make it to work, on time. It's a challenge. Many parents fail to prioritise exercise."" I seek out the little girl when the session is over. For her, this is more about spending time with her dad. Sabiti Matovu is a primary school physical education teacher who practises what he preaches.  But people like him are becoming rare in Ugandan schools. ""Physical education used to be on the timetable of every school. But here in the city, schools put emphasis only on academics,"" he says, concerned about how the country will keep its youth fit. ""Many do not have playgrounds. In the rural areas where there is space, the schools don't have PE teachers.""  On 7 July, President Yoweri Museveni launched the National Day of Physical Activity, which will be marked annually. But it will take more than a presidential gesture to keep Uganda active. Amanda Ngabirano, a lecturer in Urban Planning at Makerere's College of Engineering and Technology calls herself a ""cycologist"". She drives from home with her folding bicycle in the boot, parks halfway to work, and cycles the remaining 7km (4 miles).  My jaw drops when she says: ""I pick out the roads with the most traffic.""  Imagine cars swerving from one lane to the other, jerking to a sudden stop, boda bodas weaving through any available gap, matatu drivers hooting and screaming out the windows. Add a woman on a bicycle. ""There is order in that chaos. The drivers are going slowly, and they can see me. It's safer than the upmarket roads with fewer cars because there everyone is speeding,"" she explains. Her crusade to get the city infrastructure upgraded to provide for non-motorised modes of transport has seen the ministry of works develop its first policy along those lines. Her work may be part of the reason why, less than a month ago, the Kampala Capital City Authority marked out the first bicycle lane in Kampala. The 500-metre lane is in leafy Kololo, but it is a start. The country may be celebrating the WHO study, but Uganda is rapidly urbanising.  In the next couple of decades, there are likely to be fewer 67-year-olds still fit to till the land, and more people behind the wheel in traffic snarl-ups. Roy William Mayega of the Makerere School of Public Health did a study in the peri-urban areas of Iganga district, east of the capital, in 2013. He found that Ugandan lifestyles are changing.  ""We found that 85% of the participants were physically active. We assessed blood sugar and weight as well. The 15% who were not sufficiently active were twice as likely to have diabetes and high blood pressure than those who were active,"" he says. Dr Mayega warns that the number of Ugandans interested in sectors which require rigorous effort such as agriculture is shrinking, especially among the youth. He also noticed a shift in the food environment. In every small roadside town, young people were cooking high-calorie, processed-flour foods, and people were coming from the villages for a taste.

The Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT) is used by the NHS to test for genetic conditions, but people can pay for it privately to discover a baby's sex. Labour MP Naz Shah said it was morally wrong for people to use the test to abort pregnancies based on the outcome. The Department of Health said it would continue to review the evidence.  An investigation by the Victoria Derbyshire programme has found thousands of British women discussing using NIPT to determine sex on an online forum. Ms Shah, who is shadow women and equalities minister, said cultural practices in some communities like the South Asian community, have a preference for boys.  She said this put great strain on women ""forcing them to adopt methods such as NIPT to live up to expectations of family members"".  NIPT involves taking a sample from the woman to look for DNA from the baby circulating in her blood, to gauge the risk of possible genetic conditions such as Down's syndrome. It can also be used to determine sex, information which NHS doctors will not be sharing with parents when the test is rolled out across England next month.  Private clinics offer the same test for around ¬£150-¬£200 and do share this information. Some require only that a drop of blood be sent in the post with results sent back in a few days.  Ms Shah said: ""NIPT screenings should be used for their intended purpose, to screen for serious conditions and Down's syndrome. ""The government needs to look into this exploitative practice and enforce appropriate restrictions."" 'I had a panic attack when they said it was a girl' Zara, not her real name, is Sikh and lives in Greater London. ""I had straightaway made that decision that I didn't want to have this baby. ""We were a family of five girls and every time my Mum had another daughter everyone would come to the house as if they were coming to mourn.  ""For them it's like a burden. My fear was I didn't want to go through what my mother went through."" Zara discovered the sex of her baby five months into her pregnancy and opted to have a surgical abortion.     She now regrets the decision. ""You see friends and family that have daughters and they have such a lovely relationship. I'm someone's daughter and someone's sister,"" she said.  Zara says she believes abortion on the grounds of sex is a ""very common"" practice.  Rani Bilkhu from the Jeena International organisation says many women say they have suffered violence or been coerced into abortions because they were pregnant with a second or third girl.  It wants sex-selective abortion to be viewed as a form of honour-based violence.  ""No wonder they're resorting to sex-selection abortion because they've got no choice,"" she says. ""They don't want to be homeless, they don't want their marriage to fail - all because they couldn't give birth to a boy."" The online forums where British women discussed using NIPT include thousands of posts where women express their anxiety about having a girl.  One said: ""I need a son to heal me... my only bet is NIPT followed by continuation, only if it's a boy."" The programme also found one area, Slough, where women's clinics offering these tests were being promoted on roadside adverts. ""This poster is really telling the community, 'Come here, come to us and we'll let you know whether you're having a boy or a girl,'"" says Ms Bilkhu. Labour MP for Slough, Tan Dhesi, said marketing tests offering sex determination should be stamped out.  ""Communities in South Asia have made huge strides in tackling this social evil,"" he said. ""That's been primarily through legislation, banning gender determination clinics. In the UK I think we need to be doing likewise, with regards to the private sector as well."" Choosing an abortion due to sex is illegal in the UK, apart from some rare exemptions, but it is difficult to detect as women often cite other reasons for having the procedure. In 2015, the government acknowledged it did not know how widespread testing for sex was. It said if NIPT became more popular, it would need to analyse the impact it was having on the gender ratio in ethnic minority communities. Ms Bilkhu said it was extremely hard to measure.  ""Not only do the government not understand there's an issue around sex-selection abortion, but also charities and statutory sectors aren't asking the questions,"" she said.  The Nuffield Council, which advises on ethical issues, recently held a consultation on NIPT testing. It believes the ability to determine sex reinforces pressure on women to have boys.  ""The desire for sex-selection is a major driver of private-sector testing,"" said Tom Shakespeare from the council. ""I don't think the government want to regulate, they just don't like it in any sector.  ""But countries like China and India have recognised the problem of sex-selective abortion and so it's very difficult to get this information - in India it is illegal.  So if we allow it, people will come here as tourists."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""The pre-natal test is never meant to be used for determining the sex of a child. We will continue to review the evidence."" Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel in the UK.",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45513762,"The number of vapers in Great Britain has topped three million for the first time - four times the number in 2012, according to a survey by Action on Smoking and Health. Most use e-cigarettes because they have quit smoking and 40% are smokers who are trying to give up. The estimations are based on a survey of 12,000 British adults. But a ""worrying"" belief that vaping is as bad as smoking still exists, a King's College London analysis found.  Earlier this year, Public Health England said e-cigarettes should be made available on prescription because of how successful they were in helping people give up smoking. And a report by MPs in August said rules around e-cigarettes should be relaxed and their use on public transport debated. Ash, the public health charity, said this survey suggested smokers were getting the message that switching to vaping could improve their health. It estimates a 10% rise in e-cigarette users between 2017 and 2018, up from 2.9 to 3.2 million. But there are still some smokers - about a third - who have never tried one. Although increasing numbers of smokers now believe vaping is less harmful than smoking, 22% still think it is as bad or worse. And among the general public, one in four adults believes it to be as harmful as tobacco. Also from the survey, 17% correctly believed vaping to be a lot less harmful than smoking - but 23% said they didn't know which was more harmful. This compared with 13% and 29% last year. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said: ""UK policy is on the right track, with thousands of smokers making the switch to vaping and improving their health and little sign of non-smokers taking up vaping.  ""But even more smokers could benefit if e-cigarettes were licensed as medicines and available on prescription.""  Dr Leonie Brose, from King's College London, called the mistaken belief by some people that vaping was as harmful as smoking ""worrying"". ""Campaigns from Public Health England and others to challenge these views are important and must continue,"" she said. The top three reasons ex-smokers gave for using e-cigarettes were: Alison Cook, director of policy at the British Lung Foundation, said: ""It's really encouraging to see smokers using e-cigarettes to help them quit the much more harmful practice of smoking."" She said doctors and pharmacists ""should be very clear with people that there is a range of products available and that they can try vaping as a way to stop smoking"".",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45501854,"It was a Sunday last August and Kirstie Walkden's nine-month-old daughter, Amy, had been out of sorts for a few days. Worried, she decided to take her to the local accident and emergency unit, where Amy was diagnosed with an ear infection and sent home with some medicine. Two days later, her condition had worsened. She had a sky-high temperature, was no longer eating or drinking and had gone floppy. Her mother took her back to the hospital. ""All hell broke loose,"" says Mrs Walkden, 29. ""Within an hour, she was placed in an induced coma. She was diagnosed with sepsis and then later peneumococcal meningitis."" It was 18 days before she was ready to be discharged.  Amy is now doing well - although the family will not know for a few years whether there are any long-term effects.  ""It could have been so different,"" her mother says. ""If we had got her to hospital any later, she might not have survived."" Mrs Walkden, from the north-west of England, is now backing a plea by the Meningitis Research Foundation calling for more urgency and monitoring to ensure that parents receive the right advice about potential bacterial meningitis and sepsis cases among babies and young children. ""We felt reassured when the hospital told us it was an ear infection,"" she says. ""We were not told to look out for anything else. ""If we had, we might have brought her in sooner."" Guidance issued by the NHS advisory body the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) states the NHS should provide parents with ""safety netting"" advice if they bring in children with symptoms that could be a sign of meningitis and sepsis. The conditions can be difficult to spot at first because the symptoms, including a high temperature and vomiting, are similar to those of many less serious ailments. But a report published by the Meningitis Research Foundation has suggested this safety netting does not always happen. It cites research from last year that suggests nearly a third of young babies with meningitis receive inappropriate early treatment that delays parents seeking help. The report includes personal accounts of more than 100 parents, many of whom were sent home with little advice following their first visit to a health professional. Charity chief executive Vinny Smith says without safety netting advice advice parents can be put off seeking medical attention soon after being seen at hospital or by a GP - but these non-specific symptoms can turn lethal in just a few hours. ""When a child is ill and getting rapidly worse, parents should not be afraid to seek urgent medical help - even if they've already been seen by a doctor that same day,"" she says. Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. It can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults. Meningitis can be very serious if not treated quickly. It can cause life-threatening blood poisoning - sepsis - and can result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves. The symptoms include: These symptoms can appear in any order and some may not appear. The illnesses are sometimes known as meningococcal disease.  In the past decade, there have been between 700 and 1,300 reported cases of meningococcal disease each year in the UK.  Between 5% and 10% of cases result in death.   Of those who survive, 10% to 15% can be left with severe and disabling after-effects such as loss of hearing and sight, brain injury and damage to major organs or loss of limbs. The government in England says it has already taken action. A working group established by ministers has made a number of recommendations to improve care, including that it should be documented in patient's notes when safety netting information has been provided. The NHS is still in the process of rolling out the recommendations. The Royal College of GPs also says it has made the issue a top priority in recent years. It has produced a toolkit to help GPs manage and identify cases. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, says: ""GPs know all too well that meningitis and indeed any form of sepsis can lead to serious complications and in some cases can be fatal, if not recognised and treated in a timely manner.  ""But the challenge for all clinicians is that initial symptoms often present in exactly the same way as common viral illnesses such as flu, making both conditions very hard to spot in the early stages of disease. ""GPs are on permanent alert for signs of meningitis in their patients and we do speak to the parents of babies and young children about what they need to look out for which may indicate that an illness could be developing into something much more serious.""",,,,

There are proven benefits of the drug for people after a heart attack or stroke.   But the trial found no benefit for healthy people over the age of 70, and the pills increased the risk of potentially fatal internal bleeding.  Experts described the results as very important and cautioned against self-medicating with aspirin.  People are prescribed aspirin after a heart attack or stroke because the drug thins the blood and reduces the chances of a repeat attack. Some completely healthy people also choose to take aspirin to reduce their risk and there is continuing research into whether the drug can be used to cut the risk of cancer. However, most research on the benefits of aspirin is performed on people in middle age and there is mounting evidence the dangers increase as we get older.  The study was of 19,114 people in the US and Australia in good health, with no history of heart problems and over the age of 70. Half were given a daily low-dose aspirin for five years.  Three reports in the New England Journal of Medicine showed the pills did not reduce their risk of heart problems or have any other benefits. They did increase the number of major stomach bleeds.  Prof John McNeil, from Monash University, said: ""It means millions of healthy older people around the world who are taking low dose aspirin without a medical reason, may be doing so unnecessarily, because the study showed no overall benefit to offset the risk of bleeding. ""These findings will help inform prescribing doctors who have long been uncertain about whether to recommend aspirin to healthy patients."" The study also discovered an increase in deaths from cancer, although the researchers think this needs further investigation as it goes against current findings in the field.   Prof Peter Rothwell, of Oxford University, a leading expert on the drug, said the findings were definitive. ""Taking aspirin if you are otherwise healthy, over the age of 70, if you haven't had a previous heart attack or stroke, is really of very little benefit,"" he said.  ""And so self-medicating with aspirin in the absence of a definite medical indication isn't advisable."" The findings do not apply to people taking aspirin because of a heart attack or stroke -  they should continue to follow their doctor's advice.  And anybody who has been taking low-dose aspirin for a long time is advised not to stop overnight as that may also cause problems. Instead they should discuss any concerns with their GP, says Prof Rothwell. Follow James on Twitter.",,,,

At present, they have to hope their cancer will not return after surgery. The drug has been shown to improve the survival of people with stage III melanoma, with a particular mutation.  A skin cancer charity said making the treatment available on the NHS was ""a huge step forward"".  Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, with 15,400 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK. A gene mutation called BRAF is found in approximately half of cases - and around 500 of those people have stage III. This means that cancer cells have spread into skin, lymph vessels or lymph glands close to the melanoma, but they haven't spread to more distant parts of the body. The therapy, which has been approved by the health body NICE - the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - is a combination of the drugs dabrafenib and trametinib which can be taken at home as five tablets a day. It comes after a clinical trial of more than 800 patients found a lower risk of the cancer recurring in a group taking the therapy. Three years after surgery, 58% of this group survived with no relapse compared to 39% of the placebo group. The therapy was also found to increase the overall length of time people live, by reducing how many people develop an incurable form of the disease. However there were side effects, including fatigue and nausea, that occurred in a third of patients taking the therapy, and 10% of the placebo group. Gill Nuttall, from charity Melanoma UK, said: ""We are continuing to see an increase in the number of people in the UK with melanoma, especially among younger people. ""The availability of this treatment is a huge step forward for the hundreds of BRAF-positive patients who are currently left with very few options following surgery.  ""The current 'watch and wait' approach is an extremely worrying and stressful time for patients and their families."" Melanoma accounts for more deaths than all other skin cancers, with around 2,400 in the UK every year. Mirella Marlow, deputy director for the NICE Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said there were currently no treatments available for people with this stage and type of melanoma to lower the risk of the cancer coming back. She said the decision marked ""an important development in the management of melanoma"". Professor Ruth Plummer, clinical professor of experimental cancer medicine, University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, said the treatment had ""the potential to transform the standard of care for people with BRAF-positive stage III melanoma"".",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45549261,"There was a spike in deaths in England at the start of this summer's heatwave, new data reveals.  But statisticians say it is too early to tell how many of them can be attributed directly to the heat. On 25 and 26 June, when temperatures soared, there were 259 more deaths than the five-year average of 2,146 for those two days.  It coincided with temperatures rising above the level at which experts say heat-related deaths can occur.  The Office for National Statistics, which released the data, says it still needs to look at figures for July and August, as well as more information about registered causes of death, before assessing the reasons behind the rise.  The summer was the joint-hottest on record for the UK as a whole and the hottest ever in England, with the temperature peaking at 35.3C (95.5F) in Faversham, Kent, on 26 July. A heatwave can affect anyone, but the most vulnerable are older people, babies and young children and people with pre-existing health problems. On 21 and 22 June there were 214 fewer deaths than the five-year average for the same period, the quarterly report by the Office for National Statistics for the period from 1 April to 30 June shows. But when the temperature climbed into the high 20s and a heatwave alert was issued by Public Health England on 25 June, the number rose to above the average.  There were 1,205 deaths on that day and 1,200 on the following day, 26 June 2018. That compared with an average of 1,072 and 1,074, respectively for the same time of year in the previous five years (2013-2017). Maximum temperatures exceeded 24.5C - the level at which Public Health England warns that excess heat-related deaths may begin to become apparent - from 25 June, when a high of 30.1C (86.1F) - the UK's hottest of the year at that point - was recorded in London.  During that period, there were 382 more deaths than the average for the same period from 2013 to 2017. A peak and fall in the number of deaths was also recorded in April, coinciding with another spell of hot weather. There were 243 more deaths in England between 18 and 19 April than the five-year average across the same period, but 378 fewer between 21 and 23 April. The ONS quarterly report covers deaths registered in England between April and June. Overall, there were 108,537 deaths in England during the three-month period - 497 fewer than the five-year average. The next release, expected in December, will examine in detail those that might be attributable to the 2018 heatwave. Annie Campbell, an ONS statistician, said: ""Although the provisional data currently available appears to show a high number of deaths at the end of June, we can't confirm the heatwave is the cause.

""I heard what sounded like a train brake, followed by a metal on metal noise.  ""It was just something completely out of the ordinary. It was a bit of a shock to the system, something I just couldn't understand or really process. ""My experience at the time was quite terrifying.""  It was his first experience of the mental health condition, psychosis. Luke was 12 years old.  He said it went on from noises to hearing words, hearing his name, to eventually hearing whole sentences ""of it almost trying to talk to me"". The main symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations and delusions and it can be caused by a specific mental health condition, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression.  It can also be triggered by traumatic experiences, stress, drugs, alcohol, as a side-effect of prescribed medication or a physical condition such as a brain tumour.  While it is not as common as depression - affecting fewer than one in every hundred - experts say it is important to recognise symptoms of psychosis early because early treatment can be more effective. People with psychosis have a higher than average risk of self-harm and suicide. The charity Rethink Mental Illness has surveyed 4,000 people and found more than half believe they wouldn't be able to identify the early symptoms. They are concerned that a general lack of awareness leads to young people not getting help early on - especially as the first episode of psychosis is most likely to happen between the ages of 18 and 24. More subtle early warning signs include withdrawing from friends, expressing strange beliefs, sudden changes in mood and confused thoughts.  Luke did try to talk to a teacher at the time but he said ""it was kind of brushed aside. I was made to feel that it wasn't something that was supposed to be talked about."" So he decided to ""be strong and keep it inside and just push forward."" Luke didn't talk about it again until he dropped out of university in his third year. He acknowledges that it would have been hard for his family to spot what he was going through.  ""They thought I was fairly quiet - because that was how I dealt with it. I'd hide myself away in my room, or focus down on something else and try and stay out of other people's way. That's just how my parents thought I was - I was just a quiet child."" But at university it reached a point where he couldn't manage both university life and trying to hide his psychosis.  He dropped out while his family thought he was still studying, and then lost contact with his family. ""When I reached the lowest point of my mental illness I disappeared,"" he explained.  ""After I went missing it was fairly obvious to my family that something was wrong and so as things came to light they realised I hadn't been at university and that was the first step to getting help. They kind of confronted me about things and they were very understanding and incredibly caring.""  It is recommended that anyone experiencing psychosis should see their GP immediately.  The typical treatment involves a combination of anti-psychotic medication, psychological therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and family or social support. Luke was put in contact with the early intervention service and given medication.  ""Looking back on it it's bizarre. At that point it was so strange to think of - now I think if I'm having a bad day I can't help but tell almost everyone. I'm quite a complainer now - it feels like just such a different mentality at the time as I was almost afraid to talk about it.""  Now 26, Luke is helping to support young people going through the same thing, and he says he can see a change in how people are more open at talking about psychosis.   ""I feel it will get less likely that people feel that they want to hide it - it's far easier to talk about rather than being something almost taboo, it's just something that happens.""",,,,

According to Canada's BNN Bloomberg, the drinks giant is in talks with local producer Aurora Cannabis about developing marijuana-infused beverages.  These would not aim to intoxicate consumers but to relieve pain.   The firm declined to comment but said it was watching the cannabis drinks market closely. ""Along with many others in the beverage industry, we are closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive cannabidiol as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages around the world,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement.  Cannabidiol, a constituent of cannabis, can help ease inflammation, pain and cramping, but has no psychoactive effect.

It has given rise to a large pot growing industry and some high-profile partnerships.  Earlier this year, beer giant Molson Coors Brewing said it would make cannabis-infused drinks with Hydropothecary, while Corona-beer maker Constellation Brands invested $4bn more into pot firm Canopy Growth. A partnership between Coke and Aurora would mark the first entry of a major manufacturer of non-alcoholic drinks into the market. Quoting unnamed sources, BNN Bloomberg said Coca-Cola was in ""serious talks"" with Aurora but no deal had been finalised.

The team at University College London has developed a device which shines light into the brain to monitor oxygen and energy levels. Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) could help doctors assess brain damage earlier and tailor treatment. A clinical trial of the technology is now planned. According to the National Neonatal Database, around three in 1,000 babies born in England suffer brain injury at or soon after birth, due to lack of oxygen during delivery.  While many affected newborns recover, more than half develop disabilities, and one in 10 dies.  The risk is higher in babies born before 37 weeks, where up to 26 in 1,000 babies are affected. Early detection and treatment of brain injury could help doctors work out whether treatments are working and predict the severity of injury.  Until now, doctors have often had to wait several days before newborn babies are stable enough to undergo an MRI scan to look for brain injury. Doctors already use light sensors to measure tissue oxygen levels, but the new equipment also measures energy levels in brain cells.  Speaking at the British Science Festival in Hull, Dr Gemma Bale, an engineer from University College London working on the NIRS instrument, explained: ""The device, which can be used straight after birth, is placed on the head and shines red and infra-red light into the brain.  ""This type of light can more easily penetrate the body, like when you shine a torch on your hand. ""Changes in brain oxygen levels and energy usage change the colour of the light that is reflected back.  ""Our sensors measure the reflected light to work out whether brain cells are healthy or damaged,"" she said. Babies with reduced metabolism are those who are likely to do badly, as it means parts of their brain are too damaged to function.  Dr Bale said this offered a more patient-focused approach.  ""The first week after birth is a really critical time in babies' development. If we are able to get in sooner to assess the damage, we can tailor treatment to save lives and help prevent disability further down the line."" Dr Kathy Beardsall, a neonatologist from Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, said: ""In these vulnerable babies, being able to use a bedside, non-invasive technology would be a great advance in care.  ""It overcomes the problem of having to wait and transfer babies off the intensive care unit for an MRI when they are more stable."" The UCL team is planning a clinical trial to see whether the new technology could improve the care of newborn babies with suspected brain injury. Follow Nazima on Twitter",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45558294,"Midwives are calling for official guidance on how much weight is healthy for women to put on during pregnancy. One in five women in the UK are obese when they start pregnancy, yet there is no national target for what constitutes normal pregnancy weight gain.  Regular weigh-ins fell out of favour in the 1990s when it was suggested that they cause pregnant women unnecessary anxiety for little or no clinical gain. Officials say they are considering whether to reintroduce them.  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is reviewing its weight advice for pregnancy.  Its current guidelines say weight and height should be measured at the first appointment, but not repeatedly during pregnancy as a matter of routine. US guidelines do recommend keeping track of weight gain, and set clear targets:  NICE says it is considering whether to adopt the same recommendations in its new advice, which is still in the early phases of planning - meaning it is unlikely to be published before 2019. Its current guidelines advise against dieting when pregnant, but do say pregnant women should avoid ""eating for two"". Energy needs do not change in the first six months of pregnancy and increase only slightly in the last three months, when mothers-to-be need around 200 extra calories per day. Mandy Forrester from the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said some UK midwives were already using the US weight guidelines, but that others did not have access to weighing scales. ""There is a clear need for midwives to have the tools, guidance and training they need so they can offer women the best possible support and care. This is especially pressing because of the potentially serious complications that can arise in pregnancy as a result of women being overweight or obese."" Women who are obese (with a BMI over 30) when they become pregnant face an increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, miscarriage and pre-eclampsia.  Being over or underweight during pregnancy might also have a negative impact on the baby, according to research.  The comments from the RCM come as a new study published in the journal Diabetologia says either too much or too little weight gain during pregnancy is linked with adverse outcomes in children aged seven years.  The Hong Kong study looked at 905 mothers and their children, and found health problems such as high blood pressure and poorer blood sugar control.",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45559954,"South Africa's highest court has legalised the use of cannabis by adults in private places. Pro-marijuana activists cheered in the public gallery and chanted ""Weed are free now"" when the Constitutional Court gave its landmark ruling.  In a unanimous ruling, judges also legalised the growing of marijuana for private consumption.  South Africa's government had opposed its legalisation, arguing the drug was ""harmful"" to people's health.  It has not yet commented on the ruling, which is binding.  Three cannabis users who had faced prosecution for using the drug brought the case, saying the ban ""intrudes unjustifiably into their private spheres"".  In his judgement, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said: ""It will not be a criminal offence for an adult person to use or be in possession of cannabis in private for his or her personal consumption.""  It will, however, remain illegal to use cannabis in public, and to sell and supply it.  The Cannabis Development Council of South Africa welcomed the ruling, and called on the government to drop charges against people found in possession of the drug. Jeremy Acton, the leader of the Dagga Party, which campaigns for the use of cannabis, said the ruling should have gone further to legalise the carrying of marijuana in public.  Cannabis is referred to as ""dagga"" in South Africa.  By Andrew Harding, BBC News, Johannesburg  This judgement is a reminder that South Africa's hard-won constitution is among the most liberal in the world, backing individual rights, and in this case the right to grow and smoke your own marijuana in private, against the government's concerns about public health and public order. The Constitutional Court's ruling focuses on the issue of privacy, and a person's right to do as they please in their own home.  The potential implications of the binding judgment are enormous, and unpredictable - particularly in terms of the criminal justice system, which routinely locks up thousands of overwhelmingly poor South Africans for using or dealing in small amounts of cannabis. It is possible that the ruling, by allowing users to grow their own marijuana at home, could undermine the stranglehold of powerful drug gangs that blight so many communities. But the police, who argued against this change, will worry that the ruling will create more ambiguity and send the wrong signal to criminals.  The court has not approved - in any form - the trade in marijuana, meaning the government will not be able to profit from taxing a legalised industry. In political terms, the landmark ruling emphasises the primacy of South Africa's constitution, which brushed aside the united opposition of numerous government ministries at a time when the authority and credibility of many of this young democracy's other institutions have been eroded by corruption and poor governance. The court gave parliament 24 months to change the law to reflect its ruling.  Adults who used marijuana in private would be protected by the ruling until the law was amended.   The court did not specify the quantity of cannabis a person can grow or use in private.  Parliament would have to decide on this, it said.   In April Zimbabwe became the second country in Africa, after Lesotho, to legalise the use of marijuana for medical use.",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45565364,"Many yoghurts are full of sugar and the public should not be lulled into thinking they are eating healthy products, researchers say. The conclusion comes after a study of almost 900 yoghurts on sale in UK supermarkets. The Leeds University-led research found that organic yoghurts were among the most sugary types - containing more sugar per 100g than cola. Only natural and Greek-style yoghurts could be classed as low in sugar. The study - published in BMJ Open - comes as government health officials are encouraging manufacturers to reduce the amount of sugar consumed by the public. Yoghurts have been identified as one of the food types on which Public Health England wants to see progress. This research was undertaken shortly after the launch of the sugar-reduction programme. Unsurprisingly, yoghurt desserts contained the most sugar - an average of 16.4g per 100g. This category also included some products that did not contain yoghurt, such as chocolate mousse and creme caramel. The second most sugary product was organic yoghurts with a typical 13.1g per 100g. Children's yoghurts typically contained 10.8g per 100g, the equivalent of more than two sugar cubes, the study found. By comparison a 100g serving of a typical cola contains 9g of sugar. The NHS recommends that children aged four to six have no more than 19g of sugar, or five sugar cubes a day, and it is advised that those aged seven to 10 consume less than 24g daily. To be classed as low sugar there needs to be no more than 5g per 100g. Only 9% of products surveyed were below this threshold. Desserts - 16.4g per 100g Organic - 13.1g per 100g Flavoured - 12g per 100g Fruit - 11.9g per 100g Children's - 10.8g per 100g Dairy alternatives - 9.2g per 100g Drinks - 9.1g per 100g Natural and Greek - 5g per 100g Since the fieldwork for the study was carried out - at the end of 2016 - progress has been made on reducing sugar consumption from yoghurts. A report published in May showed sugar content in yoghurts had been reduced by 6% in the first year, making it the only food category to exceed the 5% target. By 2020, it is expected sugar will be reduced by 20%. PHE chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said this showed ""positive steps"" were being made. But Dr Bernadette Moore, lead researcher of this study, said: ""Even if we take the reduction into account, most of these yoghurts will still not be low in sugar.  ""I think people, including parents, will be surprised to know just how much sugar there is in yoghurt.  ""My advice would be to buy natural yoghurt and mix in your own fruit.""

1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45549259,"The British Nutrition Foundation is launching a concept called the ""quality calorie"", to make people think more about the types of foods they eat.  While most adults consume more than they need, simply counting calories and cutting down is not enough, it says. It wants people to look at nutritional values to select the best calories. Public Health England said excess calories were the root cause of obesity and tackling the issue was a priority. Calories give people energy - women need about 2,000 a day and men 2,500. Public Health England suggests: Food packaging will tell you how many calories (kcal) the contents have - but working out the healthiest choice can be trickier.  High-calorie foods are often less healthy but not always. And those sold as low-calorie may not be the healthiest.  Low-calorie means: Manufacturers are allowed to say their food is calorie-free if a serving has fewer than five calories - but these still count.  Experts often refer to alcohol - but any food or drink high in sugar but low in nutritional value can be said to have empty calories.  When people say hidden calories, they mean foods or drinks higher in calories than most people might expect.  About a quarter of calories now come from food and drink consumed outside of the home, according to government research. Increasingly, cafes, coffee shops and restaurants are making calorie information more visible. But it can still be difficult to keep track, especially if you add extra ingredients and flavours to your purchase.  According to Public Health England, a healthy diet should include: Things to cut down on are: A body mass index calculator can help you judge if you are a healthy weight or not. If you do need to lose weight, NHS Choices says aim to lose about 0.5-1kg (1-2lb) a week by consuming about 500-600kcal fewer a day than you need. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: ""We clearly need to improve the nation's diet but excess calories are the root cause of obesity - this is why we are working with the food industry to reduce sugar and calories in everyday foods."" Dr Frankie Phillips, from the British Dietetics Association, said: ""If you are eating too many calories, then you need to be cutting down but also making sure the ones you are consuming count for more in terms of nutrition. It's about getting value for your calories. ""Focusing on just one nutrient, like cutting down on only fat or sugar or calories, runs the risk of missing out on crucial nutrients.""",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45565377,"Smokers looking to quit as part of the annual Stoptober campaign are being warned not to go ""cold turkey"".  Government health officials have said smokers stand a much greater chance of succeeding giving up by using official NHS support or turning to e-cigarettes. Research has shown only 4% of those who go ""cold turkey"" remain smoke-free after a year.  But turning to nicotine replacement therapies, such as patches or lozenges, can increase that by 1.5 times. And getting help from an NHS stop-smoking clinic leads to a four-fold rise in the chances of succeeding, according to Public Health England. This year's Stoptober campaign will see the introduction of a free online personal quit plan service. It asks a number of questions and provides smokers with a suggested combination of support based on their level of tobacco dependency and what quitting support they have used previously. It will be available from Thursday ahead of the official start of the campaign, on 1 October. PHE deputy medical director Dr Jenny Harries said: ""There are many different types of stop smoking support available, so it can be difficult for a smoker to know what will work for them. ""The important thing is not to be put off trying to quit even if you have not managed it in the past."" Smoking rates have hit a record low in England - just 15% of the adult population smoke, a drop of a quarter since 2011.  That equates to just over six million smokers in total. E-cigarettes remain the nation's favourite stop smoking aid - with an estimated 3.2 million users, most of whom are former smokers. One of those is TV presenter Jeremy Kyle, who has given up after 35 years of smoking, using e-cigarettes. ""I was a 20-a-day smoker for most of my life and am proud to say I quit smoking earlier this year,"" he said. ""The thing that is really helping me stay smoke-free is vaping. ""I'm currently on the lowest-strength nicotine and will then come off the e-cigarette when the time is right for me. ""Since quitting I've learned just how important using support is and for people not to go 'cold turkey'.""",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45512312,"Despite previous attempts to limit access to treatment, Denmark now has the biggest proportion of babies born through assisted reproductive technology (ART) in the world.  Visit any park in Denmark and the chances are many of the children playing there were born using IVF or donor sperm. Denmark leads the world in the use of ART to build families - an estimated 10% of all births involve such techniques. Everyone in Denmark knows someone who has gone through IVF and talking about it is no taboo - chats at the schools gates or even church frequently revolve around the origins of people's children. Pia Crone Cristensen - mother to two-year-old Sara, thanks to IVF and donor sperm - is one of a growing number of single women making use of Denmark's liberal IVF rules. After failing to find a suitable partner to father her children, she decided to go it alone, when she was 39. ""I think it's great that women finally have the upper hand - we can choose to become pregnant if we want to. I think that the problem is not necessarily that women don't want the men but that the men don't want to commit to having children. It's either doing it solo or not having children at all. ""I was lucky to become pregnant in the first round of the IVF. I remember giving birth and was just so grateful. I sat in the chapel of the hospital crying. I just needed to be grateful somewhere. ""People are very open about it. I went to a baptism not too long ago and I guess because people know that I got Sara the way I did, they were telling me, 'Oh, we're trying for another baby. You know, we got this one with IVF and we're trying again.' You don't necessarily have to be very close to have that conversation."" Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK The birth of Troels Renard √òstbjerg in 1983 marked the start of Denmark's journey from just another developed country trying to make the fledgling technology work better to becoming the world record holder for ART births.   Today, only Israel challenges Denmark's IVF crown. It has far more cycles of IVF per million inhabitants - about 5,000 compared with Denmark's 2,700. But a much lower natural birth rate and higher IVF success rate means that Denmark wins on the proportion of babies in the population born thanks to reproductive technology. Prof Claus Yding Anderson, at Copenhagen's University Hospital, was part of the team that bought IVF to Denmark. He attributes its popularity to generous state funding. ""It reflects that we have a public health care system that is paying. Anything which is treatment in Denmark is free, full stop.  ""We had this national discussion that the public health care system takes care of a nose which is bending to one side, or ears which [stick out], where basically you are not sick, so it was pretty straightforward to say, 'Well of course we need to include IVF.' ""Money doesn't grow on trees in Denmark but this is the Scandinavian system. Everybody is willing to pay a lot in tax but everybody is benefiting."" The Changing Face of Procreation was broadcast on the BBC World Service. Click here to listen to the first part and here to listen to the second part. Or you can download the programmes via the BBC World Service Documentary podcast. Dr Sebastian Mohr, from Sweden's Karlstad University, has followed the growth of reproductive technology, ""Denmark has reproduced itself as a certain kind of nation. The state financing it, the people using it, the medical professionals lobbying around it - reproduction has become a national project rather than just a project of the individual."" But he points out that along with generous state funding comes state control of access to IVF.  Detailed criteria are not published but only people deemed to be ""fit parents"" are approved. Women over 40 don't get state-funded treatment and those over 45 are also barred from accessing IVF privately.  Dr Mohr argues that the decision-making process should be more public. He is investigating records of IVF funding decisions and says he has seen evidence that people who are considered ""too disabled"" are denied state funding.  It didn't used to be this way. During the 1980s and 1990s, IVF and other reproductive technologies went largely unregulated in Denmark. Doctors decided who should get treatment, initially only offering heterosexual couples the chance to conceive. However, private clinics were free to treat anyone, and anything was possible: surrogacy (now banned in Denmark), IVF using donor sperm, and access for lesbian women. IVF became controversial. Radical feminists complained that it meant medically trained men were commodifying women's bodies, while social conservatives also objected to the technology.  But in 1997 the government passed the Act on Artificial Fertilisation. Single women and lesbians - who for years had been able to pay for IVF and donor insemination - were now barred.  The new legislation sparked a fight for equality of access - but in the meantime, others spotted a loophole.  The law only banned doctors from carrying out the procedures, which led to a boom in specialist midwife-led clinics.  One such facility, the StorkKlinic, named after its midwife founder Nina Stork, became a big draw for single and lesbian women from across Europe wanting to start families. Just 5% of its clients today are Danish. ""The law opened up the possibility for entrepreneurs to establish a clinic where people could use these services even though the actual intention of the law was to exclude people,"" says Dr Mohr. ""These clinics showed that it could be done responsibly."" In 2007 the current ART law was passed, granting access to state-funded IVF regardless of a woman's marital status or sexuality.  It marks Denmark out as one of the most permissive countries in the world in terms of who can get IVF and the decades of debate have moulded Danish society into one in which most people support the government's position.  The fertility industry is now one of Denmark's most successful exports and the country is is also home to the world's biggest sperm bank, Cryos International, which deals with customers around the world. However, as the number of Danish women accessing IVF and insemination to have children has grown, so has the backlash. Rasmus Ulstrup Larsen says that last year he was the most hated man in Copenhagen.  A 28-year-old high school economics teacher, he has become the unlikely figurehead for a section of Danish society that remains deeply unsettled by the social changes brought about by Denmark's liberal assisted reproduction laws.  In particular, some worry about the growing number of single women, such as Pia Crone Christensen, having children. In 2017, Mr Larsen gained notoriety with a newspaper article that called solo mums ""a horrible modern phenomenon"" (in Danish). ""This increase of solo mums is a result of a sociological evolution. We see here in Denmark an individualistic ethics of self-realisation. It's the same as the high divorce rate. It's the same kind of culture that cultivates both things.  ""We need more common goals, a more shared way of living instead of this individualistic way of perceiving life."" But he accepts he's fighting a losing battle.  Increasing numbers of single Danish women are having babies with donor sperm. The proportion of babies born in Denmark thanks to reproductive technology is steadily rising.  And as long as Denmark's fertility rate stays low, the government is likely to keep supporting treatment that helps the population to grow.",,,,

1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-45575361,"Is it really possible to reduce violent crime by tackling it like an infectious disease? London has announced it is to follow Scotland's public health approach to help tackle violent crime. The idea of treating crime as a disease is not new, however. It originated on the streets of Chicago more than two decades ago and has its roots in the fight against Aids in Africa. London has already seen 100 murders this year following a surge in violence which has focussed attention on knife crime in particular. The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has come under increasing pressure to take action and old debates about police stop and search powers have been revived. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has admitted her officers are ""stretched"". It is a situation that bears similarities with the streets of Chicago 20 years ago.  Dr Gary Slutkin, an epidemiologist with the World Health Organisation, returned there in the mid 1990s after years spent fighting infectious diseases in Asia and Africa.  In Uganda he had tackled the spread of Aids with some success. However, he had become jaded by the death and misery he witnessed and was looking forward to a break. Instead, he was shocked by the violence and death he encountered in his homeland.  ""I saw that all this violence was happening in America and I didn't even know, as I'd been away for so long, I thought America had no problems,"" he said. ""When I came here I saw in the newspapers and TV that there were 14 year olds shooting 13 year olds in the head. Killing them. Just little kids shooting each other. What is this?"" Between 1994 and 1999, 4,663 people were murdered in Chicago. By comparison, Los Angeles - which had a significantly higher population - had only seen 3,380 homicides.  Intrigued, Dr Slutkin began to investigate. He looked at the data and noticed a number of similarities between the violence in Chicago and the epidemics he had just spent years trying to cure. He realised violent incidents were occurring in clusters at certain locations and at certain times.  Furthermore, the violence appeared to be replicating itself, similar to an infectious disease. One violent incident would lead to another and then another, and so on.  Finally, violence was increasing rapidly in a fashion very similar to an epidemic wave. As an epidemiologist, he knew to look for three things before classing a disease as contagious; clustering, self-replication and epidemic waves. Dr Slutkin concluded Chicago was facing an epidemic disease just as bad as he had witnessed in Uganda.  He decided to treat the problem in the same way. Moved to action, he obtained funding from a local university and set up Cure Violence - a project dedicated to using public health methods to tackle violent crime. As with the fight against Aids, the first rule was that violence should not be treated as ""a problem with bad people"". Instead, it would be treated as a contagion that infected people. This meant aiming to prevent violence before it broke out and mitigate it once it had. In Uganda, Dr Slutkin and his colleagues had learned people would only listen to safe sex advice if it was delivered by their peers. ""We used people who had the same access and reach from the same population,"" Dr Slutkin says. ""Gay men to reach gay men, sex workers to reach sex workers."" In Chicago, he adopted a similar approach. Controversially, he recruited former gang members to educate current gang members, intervene in disputes and hopefully prevent the violence at source. The results were instant; crime in its pilot area, West Garfield, dropped significantly. Soon the project was being adopted across other troubled parts of the city. Key to its success were the former gang members, known as Violence Interrupters. Employed as a link between - but crucially separate from - law enforcement and the gangs, they used their community contacts to identify high-risk situations and individuals and then intervene in disputes before they escalated into violence.  Angalia Bianca was a member of the infamous Latin Kings gang for more than 30 years before becoming a violence interrupter seven years ago. ""It's all about buying time in most situations, trying to calm people down and talk them down from doing something they'll regret,"" she says. ""These guys out here aren't going to listen to police, but we have a reputation and a street cred. ""We used to live our lives out on the streets, gangbanging, committing crimes. We speak their language."" The impact of this community engagement approach has been significant. Since the project began, shootings have fallen by as much as 40% in areas where violence interrupters have been present. Other cities in the United States have followed suit, most notably Los Angeles, New York and Baltimore. In Scotland, Glasgow has adapted the approach - incorporating it into a wider public health strategy involving education, health and social services. The city has seen its murder rate drop by more than a half between 2004 and 2017. The success of Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit, which received ¬£7.6m in Scottish government funding between 2008 and 2016, has now caught the eye of Mr Khan. However, the strategy is not without its problems. In Chicago, funding has been a perennial issue.  In 2015, Cure Violence went the first of two years without a full state budget due to a stalemate between governor Bruce Rauner and House Speaker Mike Madigan. Dr Slutkin believes this led to a loss in lives. ""We wrote a letter and said this was going to be a disaster, in other words predicted it,"" he said. ""We lost all of the workers for 13 communities."" The following year, 771 people were murdered in Chicago - the city's deadliest year in nearly two decades. In 2017, after the Cure Violence team had regained its funding, there was a 16% decline in murders. Over the past year, London has experienced its own surge in violent deaths. Dr Slutkin's public health approach appears to be a catalyst to the Mayor of London diagnosing the capital's violence as a ""disease"". However, there is a significant difference in scale. This year, Cure Violence received funding of $5.4m (¬£4.1m) in Chicago and $17.2m (¬£13m) in New York. Mr Khan has only put up ¬£500,000 for the project in London, a figure described by criminologist Anthony Gunter as a ""joke"". He feels the mayor has been ""slow"" to react to London's violence issue but is a fan of the Chicago approach, although he points out the city's murder rate remains high. ""The devil is in the detail and at this stage there isn't much detail,"" he says of Mr Khan's announcement. ""It needs a multi-agency approach and everyone working together. It will need Sadiq Khan to work with (home secretary) Sajid Javid."" For some communities in London, Chicago and Glasgow, violence is part of everyday life. It is part of wider social issues such as unemployment, education, broken families and drugs. Whether Mr Khan's diagnosis of violence as a disease will make a difference remains to be seen.  One person who is happy about the announcement, though, is Sarah Jones, who has been campaigning for the public health approach since being elected Labour MP for Croydon Central in 2017.  She believes violence interrupters could be key to stopping knife crime in parts of London. ""There are small groups across London which fulfil a similar role, but we need to have more people who have that respect and trust in that community,"" she says. ""Having someone to intervene at the point where they are thinking about being violent can make a massive difference.  ""The Violence Reduction Unit is a step in the right direction, but it needs commitment from everyone in the long run.""",,,,
1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45590203,"When Jackie Britton was given a blood transfusion after childbirth, she thought it was saving her life. But the infected blood could have killed her. There are thought to be thousands like her. They often feel overlooked in the wider NHS contaminated blood scandal. ""There are still people dying, not knowing they are infected,"" Jackie Britton, from Portsmouth, tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. She gave birth in 1983. Her baby daughter was fine but when Jackie started haemorrhaging she needed a blood transfusion. It would be another 29 years before she realised that that blood had been contaminated with hepatitis C, for which there was no blood screening at the time. The virus went undetected for years, slowly damaging Jackie's liver. As she puts it: ""The four units of blood that had saved my life was killing me."" Jackie started noticing something might be wrong only in her 50s, when she was experiencing ""absolute fatigue"". ""I would feel physically sick. I would start retching just stood up trying to cook a meal, because of the effort and the energy it was taking out of me. ""Hep C is just trauma after trauma."" A new generation of drugs means Jackie has now cleared the virus itself from her body - but the damage has already been done.  She has cirrhosis of the liver and needs checks every six month to make sure it has not led to cancer or liver disease. The contaminated blood scandal of the 1970s and 1980s is often called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Almost 5,000 people with the blood disorder haemophilia were given a treatment contaminated with hepatitis and in many cases HIV. Then there is a second group of people who like Jackie received a blood transfusion after childbirth or an operation.  There are no solid figures available on exactly how many transfusion patients were infected before 1992. But estimates range from about 5,000 - the same number of people with haemophilia affected - to up to 28,000, the figure suggested by a Department of Health analysis of the scandal. It is thought there will still be some people living today with hepatitis C, contracted by blood transfusion, who have not yet been diagnosed. For Bob Leary, now 72, it all started in 1986 with a burst intestine.  Admitted to hospital and given a transfusion, he didn't think much more of it until he had a blood test four years later. He was told he had hepatitis C and could expect to live for another 10 to 15 years. ""As you can imagine, it was a very severe shock,"" he says. By 2012, Bob's liver had started to fail. He became jaundiced and lost weight dramatically.  The following year, having been told he had just weeks left to live, a liver transplant saved his life.  He will be on medication until he dies. ""I don't want to get into the blame culture, I could be bitter all my life,"" he says, ""but we need to make sure nothing like this happens again."" His hope is that a public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal, set to begin on Monday, will provide some answers. It comes after years of campaigning from victims and their families. Key issues include: For Jackie, it is about far more than her own health. Last year, her friend and fellow campaigner Sally Vickers died from cancer caused by the hepatitis C she contracted in 1982 following an operation. ""She loved living. I mean she fought and fought,"" says Sally's husband, Alan. He remembers the moment she was given less than a month to live. ""The specialist came down and said, 'I'm sorry, it's not only severe cancer in your liver but it has spread to your lungs. ""We simply wanted to come home so that she could be with me."" The anger Alan and Sally felt, however, was not directed at doctors, or the NHS, but at the people responsible for the whole blood donation system at the time in the Department of Health. ""I want somebody held accountable for it,"" Alan says. ""Somebody has got to be accountable for this."" The Cabinet Office said in a statement: ""The Infected Blood Inquiry is a priority for the government. ""It is extremely important that all those that have suffered so terribly can get the answers they have spent decades waiting for and lessons can be learnt so that a tragedy of this scale can never happen again. ""Government is committed to providing the inquiry with all the support it needs.""

1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45591584,"Emotional testimonies from people infected with HIV and hepatitis have been heard at the start of the inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal. The public inquiry is looking at how thousands of NHS patients were given infected blood products during the 1970s and 1980s in what has been dubbed the worst-ever NHS treatment disaster. In a video played to the inquiry, one man described how he felt he lost his entire life after finding out at the age of 43 that he had been infected with hepatitis C when he was a child. He was given an injection of blood products when he was eight for a swollen knee that was misdiagnosed as haemophilia. ""I lost everything. I lost my whole life the day I found out - everything ended,"" he explained. With her identity hidden, one woman said she became infected with HIV through her husband who was a haemophiliac, and who had been given contaminated blood. She said when they found out they were left stunned and devastated. ""This was the mid-1980s and the climate of fear, discrimination and stigma associated with HIV and Aids was horrendous,"" she added.  ""We coped the best we could. We were silenced, and we kept quiet."" Another victim, a widow, whose husband John died of Aids in 1994 and who also had hepatitis C, said: ""I feel we have been treated very badly. Nobody has listened to us over the years."" There have been previous inquiries into the scandal, but this is the first UK-wide public inquiry that can compel witnesses to testify. It comes after decades of campaigning by victims, who claim the risks were never explained and the scandal was subsequently covered up.  About 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses over a period of more than 20 years - nearly 3,000 of them have since died. This was because they were injected with blood products used to help their blood clot. It was a new treatment introduced in the early 1970s. Before then patients faced lengthy stays in hospital to have transfusions, even for minor injuries. Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment - known as clotting agent Factor VIII - and so supplies were imported from the US.  But much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. The blood products were made by pooling plasma from up to 40,000 donors, and concentrating it. People who underwent blood transfusions were also exposed to the contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s the products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this, and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991 and by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk. Steve Dymond is now in his early 60s. He initially had only mild symptoms of haemophilia and led an active life. During the 1980s his health began to suffer. His muscles were sore, his joints ached and he was always exhausted.  After going to hospital following a minor hand injury in the mid-1980s, he was told he had been treated with Factor VIII that had not been heat-treated. The concern was that he may have been exposed to HIV. At the time it took 18 months to get a diagnosis - a wait that his wife Su Gorman said put their lives on hold. He was given the all-clear, but in the 1990s was diagnosed with hepatitis C.  He is now clear of hepatitis C, although his health has continued to suffer.  Two years ago he suffered a near-fatal stomach bleed, has suffered hearing loss and has a damaged liver, leaving him at risk of cancer. He said people have been ""betrayed and lied to"" throughout, with the government, health professionals and drug companies all guilty of trying to avoid responsibility. ""It is difficult to try to imagine - even though there is a public inquiry - how they will be able to get past these walls of obfuscation,"" said Mr Dymond. The government has been strongly criticised for dragging its heels.  There have been previous inquiries. One was led by Labour peer Lord Archer of Sandwell and was privately funded. It held no official status and was unable to force witnesses to testify or force the disclosure of documents. Meanwhile, the Penrose Inquiry, a seven-year investigation launched by the government in Scotland, was criticised as a whitewash when it was published in 2015. Greater Manchester mayor and former health secretary Andy Burnham has repeatedly called for a probe into what happened. Mr Burnham claimed in the House of Commons last year that a ""criminal cover-up on an industrial scale"" had taken place. The government announced there would be an inquiry only after it faced a possible defeat in a vote on an emergency motion. The inquiry could last more than two years. Payments have been made to some of the people who were infected - the first fund was set up as long ago as 1989. But if the new inquiry finds culpability, it opens the door to victims seeking large compensation payouts through the courts. Retired judge Sir Brian Langstaff, who is leading the inquiry, said it marked the start of something which several people had campaigned for over many years. He said there had already been more than 100,000 documents submitted, with the prospect of lots more to come. Speaking at the start of the inquiry, he said if the campaigners were right there was a ""real chance"" the numbers affected could rise as there would be people out there who did not yet know they had been infected. ""It is a truly sobering thought,"" he added. Liz Carroll, chief executive of The Haemophilia Society, called on the inquiry to work diligently to ""uncover the truth, bring justice and ultimately closure for victims and their families"". ""This scandal devastated generations of people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders. ""Our members have waited decades for this to be properly investigated.""

There are strict criteria for NHS artificial insemination and many women say private treatment is too expensive, so they turn to the internet. One woman told how a potential donor she met turned out to be married and had had a vasectomy. A fertility expert called for unregulated sites to be shut down.   Online sperm donation is not illegal but it must be provided free, although expenses can be covered. Some online donors offer artificial insemination (AI) and others natural insemination (NI) - effectively unprotected sex with a stranger. ""Sarah"", 26, from Yorkshire, is single and said she wanted a baby without a partner. She told BBC Inside Out the cost of private treatment was too high and going online meant the treatment was free, although she did experience problems. She said: ""There have been a few idiots that you really wouldn't want to interact with, because they do harass you or start sending you images you really don't need to see."" Couple Kirsti and Danielle, from West Yorkshire, said they had faced pressure from men online to use NI. Kirsti said: ""Some people try to put you off by sending you messages of miscarriages and stuff, like if you do it that way, this will happen.  ""So they are trying to change your mind for the method, so then you have sex with them.""  Sarah did meet one man online but he was not as he seemed. ""Ultimately it turned out he was married and that he'd actually had a vasectomy, so was in no way viable at all,"" she said. ""It made me feel like I couldn't trust people on the site.  ""I think they do need to be policed by a proper organisation, not just some random person out there because you don't know if they're safe because there's no proof of who you are on there."" Registered clinics carry out a strict screening process for sexually transmitted infections and infectious diseases and check potential donors' complete medical history. Alison Lamont, from one of these, Newcastle Fertility Centre, said it was difficult for the clinic to find donors. Fertility expert Dr Larisa Corda said the growing trend of online sperm donation was ""really alarming"". She said: ""I think women are putting themselves in an incredibly vulnerable position medically speaking and secondly the potential for abuse."" She said she believed the cost was a real barrier to a lot of women and it meant they were putting themselves in vulnerable situations, such as using unregulated online donors. ""In the ideal world, I'd love to see them shut down because I think women's safety and welfare has to be paramount here,"" she said. Dr Tamara Turner-Moore, senior lecturer in psychology at Leeds Beckett University, is involved in a study about online sperm donation, which she believes will be the first of its kind. It will look at the number of websites offering sperm, what the sites look like and the profiles of men using them and how they present themselves. The study will also look at women's experiences including those who have experienced sexual violence by online sperm donors. It hopes to get an idea of the number of such sites and the problems women face and raise awareness of them.

1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45601052,"Obesity is set to overtake smoking as the biggest preventable cause of cancer in UK women by 2043, a Cancer Research UK report predicts. Currently, 12% of cancers in women are linked to smoking, and 7% to being overweight and obese. But with the number of smokers falling and obesity rates projected to rise, the charity estimates that gap will disappear in 25 years time. The figures assume that current trends will continue. Cancer Research UK's projections calculate that by 2035, 10% of cancers in women (around 25,000 cases) could be related to smoking and 9% (around 23,000 cases) to carrying excess weight. And by 2043, if those trends continued, being overweight and obese could be linked to even more cases of cancer than smoking in women. In UK men, obesity is not predicted to overtake smoking as a preventable cause of cancer until some time later, because more men than women smoke. Although obesity is more common among men too, obesity in women is thought to be a greater driver of cancers in the female population. The report says types of cancer linked to smoking include acute myeloid leukaemia, lung, bladder, bowel, cervical, pancreatic and stomach.  Cancers linked to being overweight or obese include bowel, gall bladder, kidney, liver, breast, ovarian and thyroid. Professor Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK's prevention expert, said the government must build on the lessons of smoking prevention to reduce the number of weight-related cancers. She said those who were overweight in childhood were five times more likely to be carrying excess weight as an adult. Recent figures show that levels of severe obesity during childhood have risen over the last decade in England. ""That's why we are raising awareness of the link between cancer and obesity and calling for measures to protect children, like a ban on junk food adverts before 9pm and for restrictions on price promotions of 'less healthy' products,"" Prof Bauld said. She said the decline in smoking was a cause for celebration.  ""It shows how decades of effort to raise awareness about the health risks plus strong political action including taxation, removing tobacco marketing and a ban on smoking in indoor public places, have paid off.  ""But, just as there is still more to do to support people to quit smoking, we also need to act now to halt the tide of weight-related cancers and ensure this projection never becomes a reality.""",,,,

The 18-year-old from south Wales was sent to London as her local hospital had no specialist facilities to deal with eating disorders. Since 2012, there has been an 8% rise in the number of children receiving mental health treatment outside Wales. The Welsh Government said it was often necessary for children to attend ""very specialist"" centres in England. Staff shortages have been identified as a major reason for the growing problem. An investigation by BBC's Panorama programme has raised major questions as to whether child and adolescent mental health services in Wales and England are fit for purpose. Cerys was a happy, outgoing child until she developed anxiety five years ago.  ""Things started to build up so I found myself feeling more uncomfortable in social situations and uncomfortable going out into public places,"" she said.  ""It got to the point where my anxiety was so overwhelming that I couldn't leave the house and I couldn't go to school."" She visited her GP three times before getting specialist help, by which point her illness had developed further.  ""I started to develop symptoms of OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder] and it was all to do with my fear of contamination,"" she said. ""I would spend my days cleaning the entire house. Not long after that I started to diet, but it developed into anorexia.  ""[My weight] was something I could control. Whereas I couldn't control these intrusive thoughts, focusing on the number going down on the scale gave me a distraction."" She was later admitted to the ward of a general hospital in Wales, but when they did not have the specialist facilities to deal with eating disorders, she was sent to London.  ""Obviously going to a psychiatric hospital in itself is really scary, then being five hours away from home is really scary,"" she said. ""Putting them both together is absolutely terrifying."" A report by the Children, Young People and Education Committee for the National Assembly for Wales, published in April, showed that the majority of those requiring highly specialist in-patient care still needed to travel to England to receive it.  It also highlighted an ""unacceptable gap"" in the provision of in-patient mental health services in north Wales due to recruitment challenges. South Wales Police have called for better mental health education in schools after a rise in young people being detained under the Mental Health Act. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring young people can access mental health services as close to home as possible.  ""However, on occasions care is provided at very specialist centres in England that provide services for the whole of the UK."" Dr Jon Goldin of the Royal College of Psychiatrists added that there is a problem across the UK with young people transitioning into adult mental health services upon turning 18.  ""Adult mental health services focus on adults with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major mental illness and young people often feel that that is not the kind of service they need,"" he said.  Cerys's initial request to transfer to adult services when she turned 18 was refused.  It was only when she was admitted to A&E that she was accepted.  ""I did fight. I said 'I don't feel well enough yet‚Ä¶ I want to go to adult services' but still it was a no,"" she said.  ""It was only after a few trips to A&E when they realised [I] do need adult services. ""Unfortunately it's another waiting list to actually receive the therapy. Who knows [how long that will take]. I'm just hoping it will be before university.""",,,,

Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez, went to the port of La Guaira to welcome the Chinese crew.  He said that the Peace Ark's visit was agreed by President Nicol√°s Maduro during a visit to Beijing last week.  Venezuela agreed at the time to increase its exports of oil to China, which is one of its main creditors.  Venezuela's economic crisis has led to severe shortages of food and medicines and the collapse of public services.

The Faculty of Dental Surgery of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow wants excess sugar to be cut from school dinners. It said that about a third of children suffer from dental decay, while three in 10 are overweight or obese. Ministers say they will ""carefully consider"" the response to a consultation on the matter. The faculty wants to see puddings taken off school lunch menus and replaced with soup or fruit, and is opposed to the idea of including sugar-free drinks on the list of permitted drinks for secondary school. Faculty Dean, Prof Graham Ogden, said: ""We fully support the positive intention of these proposed regulations, but we feel that the Scottish government should take a bolder approach if it's to ensure that our young people have the healthiest possible start in life."" Prof Ogden added: ""For example, we all agree that children should have greater access to more fruit and vegetables as part of their school day, but increasing access does not necessarily increase consumption. ""The guidance must include an evidence-based plan to ensure any increase in provision also ensures that our young people consume larger amounts of healthier food during school meals. ""We also know that diet drinks cause dental erosion, in addition to being a gateway to sugar. We should aim to ensure that our children's oral health gets off to the best possible start in life."" The faculty, which represents more than 1,000 dentists and trainees, has also called for action to ensure that all children and young people have access to facilities in schools to brush their teeth after meals.

Experts say the device, which is placed below the injury, helps lost signals from the brain reach the leg muscles. US research teams at the University of Louisville and the Mayo Clinic, report the success in Nature Medicine and the New England Journal of Medicine.  One of the recipients says her life has been transformed by the technology. Kelly Thomas, 23, from Florida, is one of two patients at the University of Louisville who has been helped by the development, which has been combined with months of intense rehabilitation therapy.   She said: ""Being a participant in this study truly changed my life, as it has provided me with a hope that I didn't think was possible after my car accident. ""The first day I took steps on my own was an emotional milestone in my recovery that I'll never forget, as one minute I was walking with the trainer's assistance and while they stopped, I continued walking on my own. It's amazing what the human body can accomplish with help from research and technology."" Jeff Marquis, who was injured in a mountain-biking accident, has also benefited.  The 35-year-old is now able to walk for himself with support either from a frame or from people on either side of him holding his hands. A third patient, 29-year-old Jered Chinnock, was treated at the Mayo Clinic in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles.  He injured his spine in 2013 in a snowmobile accident. Since having the patch fitted he has been able to walk more than 100m with the support of a frame.  The patch does not repair the damage but circumvents it by stimulating nerves lower down in the spinal cord.  This appears to allow signals from the brain to reach the target muscles so the person can voluntarily control their own movements again.  When the stimulation was switched off again the conscious movement didn't happen.  Neurosurgeon Dr Kendall Lee, who co-led the team from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said: ""It's very exciting, but still very early in the research stage.""  Although there are many unanswered questions, including precisely how it works and who it might help, Dr Lee said: ""It gives hope to people faced with paralysis."" Other scientists have had success in the past with mending spinal damage using cells.",,,,

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will examine measures such as age limits on purchasers and possibly ending over-the-counter sales. Experts say available evidence suggests more than half of patients with eating disorders have misused them.  Laxatives should never be used for weight control.  Medical professionals warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and imbalances that can lead to kidney failure.

She welcomes the idea of more safeguards, as does Rebecca Field, a spokeswoman for eating-disorders charity Beat: ""Just as painkillers are regulated to prevent people overusing them and harming their own health, there should be restrictions on the availability of laxatives.  ""It is vital that people are aware of the dangers of abusing laxatives and there should be more education on their effects.

1809,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45638646,"Life expectancy in the UK has stopped improving for the first time since 1982, when figures began.  Women's life expectancy from birth remains 82.9 years and for men it is 79.2, the figures from the Office for National Statistics, for 2015-17, show.  In some parts of the UK, life expectancy has even decreased. For men and women in Scotland and Wales, it declined by more than a month. Men in Northern Ireland have seen a similar fall. For women in Northern Ireland, and for men and women in England, life expectancy at birth is unchanged. The ONS said the stalling of life expectancy was linked to a particularly high number of deaths from 2015 to 2017, which coincided with a bad flu season and excess winter deaths. It said there was ""much ongoing debate"" about the reasons behind this and what direction the trend may take in the future. It is not clear what is driving the trend, but some academics have argued that government austerity policies, such as cuts to social care budgets in England, must have played a part.  Ministers have said that no such causation can be proved, although Public Health England has been asked to carry out a review of life expectancy trends. Dr Kingsley Purdam, senior lecturer in social research methods and statistics at the University of Manchester, said the figures were ""shocking"".  ""Poverty, austerity and cuts to public services are impacting on how long people are living in the UK,"" he said.  ""We all need to look after our health but many of us, including the most vulnerable populations, need help at a time when evidence suggests that services are being cut. ""The lost years of life have an impact not just on the individual but on those people who are ultimately left behind including partners, children and grandchildren.""   But Prof Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said there were other factors that might explain the stall in progress. ""We still do not know how much this is a result of direct health effects such as flu epidemics, how much is a result of social and economic factors, and how much is a failure to go on improving smoking cessation or other preventive measures,"" he said. The data also shows that the UK lags behind other leading countries for life expectancy, including Switzerland, Japan, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. Of the countries the ONS compared the UK with, Switzerland was the nation with the longest life expectancy for men. For women, it is Japan. Men in Switzerland are expected to live to 81.5 years. Women in Japan are predicted to live to 87.  Throughout the 20th Century, the UK experienced steady improvements in life expectancy at birth, resulting in a larger and older population. This has been attributed to healthier lifestyles among the population as it ages, such as reduced smoking rates, and improvements in treating infectious illnesses and conditions such as heart disease.  But in recent years, the progress has slowed. And in the latest data it has ground to a halt.  The population of people who are 90 or over is still increasing but this is due to previous improvements in life expectancy going back many decades.  The number of centenarians decreased slightly between 2016 and 2017, reflecting low numbers of births during World War One.  But the ONS said it was expected to continue to increase again from 2019. By Robert Cuffe, BBC News head of statistics  Since the 1980s, life expectancy has been going up by roughly two months a year every year, as we saw fewer deaths due to smoking or heart problems.  But after 2011, that rate of improvement has been slowing.  It could be because it's hard to keep on improving every year. It could be because of hard winters or difficult flu seasons. But we're not sure about exactly what has caused this trend.  So this data is really telling us about death rates in the UK for the past three years.  And we can be sure that picture in death rates is real.  How sure can we be that you'll live as long as the ONS predicts? Not very - the ONS is not making precise predictions about what will happen in the future to determine how long you live.  Medical breakthroughs, pandemics and the wars of the next 80 years are impossible to predict.  A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""Recent trends in life expectancy and mortality in the UK can also be seen in a number of countries across Europe, North America and Australia.  ""As part of our long-term plan for the health service, we are taking action to help people live longer and healthier lives - cancer survival is at a record high while smoking rates are at an all-time low - backed by our additional funding of an extra ¬£20.5bn a year by 2023-24, which will transform care for cancer and other chronic diseases.""",,,,

The Department of Health said they were working with the manufacturers to ""resolve the supply situation as quickly as possible"".  They said limited supplies were being closely managed. ""Any patient who is unable to obtain supplies should speak to their doctor about using an alternative adrenaline auto-injector device,"" said a government official. EpiPen is the biggest of the adrenaline auto-injectors on the market and shortages have had a knock-on effect, cutting into the stocks of other AAIs Jext and Emerade.

""People have been traipsing pharmacy to pharmacy to try and find them because they didn't even have the first pen - at least I knew I had one pen that was in date.  ""It would be really worrying if you didn't have any at all - out-of-date adrenaline is better than no adrenaline but obviously these pens have a shelf life for a reason.

And do not dispose of any ""expired"" AAI devices before receiving a new one. Even if a device is out-of-date, as long as the liquid inside is not cloudy or discoloured it can still be used in an emergency.  Jacqueline had to wait a month last year for her second pen and hopes the issues will have been sorted out by the time she needs to replace them next time.  She said: ""Pens last a year or 18 months.

A plant-based diet of fruit, veg, grains, fish, nuts and olive oil - but not too much meat or dairy - appeared to have benefits in terms of mood.  Experts say trials are now needed to test the theory and to learn whether depression can be treated with diet. Why are Mediterranean diets so healthy? Dr Camille Lasalle, who carried out the analysis with colleagues at University College London, said the evidence so far pointed to the idea that the foods we eat can make a difference in lowering our risk of depression, even though there is no solid clinical proof yet. Explaining the link between mood and food is tricky.  There are lots of other factors that may be involved. Without tightly controlled trials, it is unclear how big an impact following a Mediterranean diet might have.  Prof Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, recommended ""a heavy dose of caution"". ""Whilst eating healthier is good for many reasons, we need more evidence before we can say plant-rich diets can improve mental health,"" he said. ""The only way to prove whether the links are genuine is to conduct large randomised trials in people at risk of depression. Such trials would take considerable effort but seem worthwhile to conduct."" Stephen Buckley, from mental-health charity Mind, said it was good advice to eat a healthy diet, get regular physical activity and cut down on ""mood-altering products, such as sugar, caffeine and alcohol"".  ""It's widely accepted that there's a strong connection between what we eat and how we feel, with blood-sugar levels affecting our mood and energy. ""If you are experiencing depression or anxiety, it might be hard to focus on your health, or you may resort to unhelpful coping strategies, such as drugs or alcohol.  ""If this is the case, you might benefit from other forms of treatment such as medication or talking therapies."" Research into the traditional Mediterranean diet has shown it may reduce our risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol, which are all risk factors for heart disease. Researchers have also found that people who closely follow a Mediterranean diet may live a longer life and be less likely to put on weight. A typical Mediterranean diet includes lots of vegetables, fruits, beans, cereals and cereal products, for example wholegrain bread, pasta and brown rice. It also contains moderate amounts of fish, white meat and some dairy produce. It is the combination of all these elements that seems to bring health benefits, but one of the key aspects is the inclusion of healthy fats.

Children aged eight to 11 who used screens for fun for less than two hours a day performed better in tests of mental ability, a study found.   Combining this with nine to 11 hours of sleep a night was found to be best for performance. Researchers said more work was now needed to better understand the effects of different types of screen use.  However, they acknowledge that their observational study shows only an association between screen time and cognition and cannot prove a causal link.  And it did not look at how children were using their screen time, be it to watch television, play videogames or use social media.    The study, of 4,500 US children, published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal, used questionnaires to estimate the child's: Children also completed a test, which assessed cognitive skills, including: The study controlled for: It found that children who each day had less than two hours of recreational screen time, got nine to 11 hours of sleep, and did at least one hour of physical activity performed better than who did none of these. Less than two hours of screen time a day was the one factor most linked to better performance in the test. Dr Jeremy Walsh, from the CHEO Research Institute, in Ottawa, Canada, said: ""Based on our findings, paediatricians, parents, educators, and policymakers should promote limiting recreational screen time and prioritising healthy sleep routines throughout childhood and adolescence."" Dr Walsh added that more research was now needed into the links between screen time and cognition, including studying the effects of different types of screen time. He said there was some evidence, for example, that video games and educational TV programmes might have cognitive benefits. In contrast, emerging evidence suggested the use of mobile devices and social media may be harmful for attention, memory and impulse control, he said.  However, the authors acknowledged there were limitations to their study, including that the data was self-reported.  The questionnaires were also only used only at the beginning of the study and so did not track how behaviours may change over time. Dr Kirsten Corder, senior investigator scientist at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said it added to existing evidence showing potential negative links with screen time and cognitive development in children. But she pointed out that the children may have struggled to answer the questions accurately.  Dr Corder also said further work was needed to develop more accurate ways to assess the effects of screen time in detail.  ""These results will hopefully stimulate further research using techniques that allow researchers to explore how multiple behaviours may interplay to benefit cognition and health,"" she said.

Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) guidelines said early diagnosis of conditions placenta praevia and placenta accreta was vital. They added doctors should discuss with women the safest way to give birth. The conditions can lead to heavy bleeding and sometimes put mother and baby's lives at risk. TV personality Kim Kardashian developed placenta accreta when pregnant with her daughter North West. TV presenter Amanda Holden suffered from the rare placenta praevia-accreta when expecting her youngest daughter Hollie. Placenta praevia happens when the placenta attaches in the lower part of the uterus (womb), sometimes completely covering the cervix (neck of the womb). Placenta accreta is a rare but serious condition when the placenta is stuck to the muscle of the womb and/or to nearby structures such as the bladder.  Both conditions can cause heavy bleeding, particularly towards the end of the pregnancy, because the placenta is low down in the uterus. This can sometimes require blood transfusions and lead to the loss of the uterus. The RCOG has produced an online leaflet with information for women who may develop or have these conditions. It says the rates of placenta praevia and placenta accreta have increased and are likely to continue to increase as a result of rising rates of caesarean births and the use of assisted reproductive technology, such as IVF. This is because potential scars in the uterus created by caesareans and fertility treatment mean any subsequent pregnancies are more likely to implant in the scar, causing problems with the placenta. The highest rates of complication for both mother and baby occur when these placenta complications are only diagnosed at delivery, the RCOG said. And it encouraged more scans and specialised care to help reduce any risks. Prof Eric Jauniaux, lead author of the guidelines, said: ""We hope this updated guidance will support healthcare professionals during discussions with women and their partners who may be considering assisted reproduction, particularly IVF, or an elective caesarean birth.   ""These are both risk factors that can increase risk of developing these serious complications of the placenta."" Prof Jauniaux, professor of obstetric and foetal medicine at University College London, said the guidelines should also help doctors to diagnose the complications early and discuss the safest way for women to give birth. Dr Geeta Kumar, chair of the RCOG patient information committee, said: ""It is important for women to be aware of these complications of the placenta, but they should be reassured that these are very rare and specialist care is available.  ""Early diagnosis is key to reduce harms associated with placenta praevia and accreta to ensure the safest possible outcome for mother and baby."" The placenta develops together with the baby in the uterus during pregnancy. It attaches to the wall of the uterus and provides a connection between mother and baby. Oxygen and nutrients pass from the woman's blood through the placenta and into the baby's blood. The placenta is delivered shortly after a baby is born, and is sometimes called the afterbirth. It is more common if a woman has had previous caesareans, fertility treatment or if they smoke. If you have placenta praevia, your baby will probably need to be born by caesarean. One in 200 women have the condition at the end of their pregnancy. It is a complication which affects between one in 300 and one in 2,000 pregnancies. This is more common if a woman has previously had a caesarean.  It may cause heavy bleeding at the time of birth. Vasa praevia is a very rare condition affecting between one in 1,200 and one in 5,000 pregnancies. It is where blood vessels travelling from your baby to your placenta, unprotected by placental tissue or the umbilical cord, pass near to the cervix.  If these blood vessels tear, this can be very dangerous for your baby.",,,,

She finds it hard to believe anyone could survive it. ""I had literally no symptoms - no pain or illness,"" Jen Taylor tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, remembering back to when an unusual lump started to develop on her top jaw. ""I went to my dentist, who thought it was an abscess,"" she says. It was two months before the 30-year-old found the cause, being diagnosed with bone cancer in August 2017, having attended hospital. ""I remember the consultant saying, 'Sorry,' many, many times, 'but it's cancer.'"" The chemotherapy began shortly after. ""My chemo was intense - Monday to Friday for three weeks in a row,"" she says. ""All my hair fell out in a week and I had a few scary things, like suspected heart attacks."" But then came treatment for the growth - 16 hours of surgery to remove her top jaw, and reconstruct it. It was a major process. ""It's not just my jaw - it was behind my cheek up to my eye socket, the whole back of my nose, and also almost to the back of my skull,"" she says. Doctors used bone from her shoulder blade and muscle from her back to fashion a new roof for her mouth.  They also connected the reconstructed area with veins in her neck to give her a blood supply. Doctors think they removed all the cancer - although she is still having regular MRI scans. But while the surgery restored her appearance, she was not able to eat, drink or talk initially. ""Psychologically I wasn't prepared at all,"" she says. ""I didn't have support apart from the doctors and nurses and there were days where I didn't know how the hell I was going to get better. ""I was pleased to be alive but there were times when I looked at myself in the mirror and found it so hard to deal with how I'd changed."" What did help, however, was that Jen documented her appearance over a period of two months - taking a photo every few days. ""If if it wasn't for the photos, I'd have despaired, thinking nothing was really improving,"" she says. ""What's been hard is the place where they took the cancer out has sunk quite a bit as the swelling has gone down - people ask me if I have a cleft palate."" After weeks of agony and frustration, Jen relearned how to chew but she may never be able to breathe through her nose again. She is now awaiting dental implants, as she currently has only six top teeth, on the left-hand-side of her face. She can see the progress she has made so far but still feels she does not ""look normal"". ""I still look at myself and think, 'Oh, there's that person with cancer,'"" she says. Jen is now going back to work, as an account manager, something she says she owes in part to the charity Macmillan Cancer Support. ""The support I got, whether it was talks, or Look Good Feel Better workshops, I knew I could get that help,"" she says. ""That familiarity was so important to me and the safe space they gave me."" Jen writes a blog - initially as a tool to keep family and friends updated on her progress but over time it has become much more than that. ""It's become an amazing thing, connecting so many people,"" she says. Jen hopes to continue her recovery and looking back at old photos she says it is difficult to come to terms with where she started from. ""I can't believe anyone can survive it,"" she says.

More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say. About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone. The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past. Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions. But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province. Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people.  HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.  Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife. Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.  Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships. Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue.",,,,

The medicines regulator said it had agreed to extend the use-by date of some 0.3mg EpiPens by four months. It comes as parents told the BBC their children's supplies were due to expire in a few days, and they had been unable to get replacements. The government says it is working with EpiPen's makers to resolve the issue.  EpiPens are the most common adrenaline auto-injectors (AAIs) and are prescribed to people with potentially serious allergies, such as to nuts, milk, fish, shellfish, eggs and some fruits.  People are recommended to keep two of the devices with them at all times for cases of anaphylaxis - a severe and sometimes life-threatening reaction often caused by allergies - as one is not always enough. They can only be used once and usually have an expiry date that lasts for a minimum of 12 months. There have been shortages of EpiPens in the UK and other countries for months. There has also been a shortage of the alternative AAIs prescribed in the UK - Jext and Emerade - amid a surge in demand for them. In response to the shortages, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it had agreed to a request by Mylan, the company behind EpiPen, to extend the expiry date of some batches of the 0.3mg version of the device.  The MHRA said it made the decision after it was given evidence that showed the shelf life of the 0.3mg pen was 20 months from the date it was manufactured. It said the devices would work ""just as effectively"" during the extended expiry period. But the extension does not apply to the 0.15mg version, given to children under 30kg. EpiPens should not be used if the solution is discoloured, brown, there are solid particles, or signs of leakage or damage.  Other AAIs should never be used after their expiry date without first checking with your medical practitioner. Lynne Riles said she had been trying to get an EpiPen prescription for her seven-year-old daughter for the past six weeks. ""The pens we have now expire at the end of September, and I just feel at my wits' end.""  Sal Smith said her four-year-old's EpiPens were also due to expire at the end of the month, after she had tried for four weeks to get more. ""Still no sign of them... I'm getting worried now."" Q&A: What is anaphylaxis?  Mylan has no stock of the 0.15mg pens left, the Department of Health and Social Care said in guidance to healthcare professionals. More of these pens are due in October but this is not expected to meet normal demand, the department said.  Emma Cummings, whose 10-year-old son Loui has severe allergies, said if supply problems continued and she had no AAIs left that were in date, she would be forced to keep her son indoors, as he is at risk from airborne allergens. ""Loui wouldn't be allowed out of the four walls of our own house, where I can categorically state that there is nothing in the house to trigger any allergies for him. ""That will restrict his education, his after-school activities, but you would.  ""Parents such as ourselves, with a child like Loui, would have no choice."" The DHSC guidance said that if people were left with nothing but expired AAIs they should keep them - until they get replacements - and be prepared to use them. While AAIs lose their potency and become less effective after their expiry date, they are not harmful, and it is better to use an expired AAI than none at all, it said. It said at present it was believed that ""careful management"" of existing supplies would prevent the need for using expired pens. Health minister Lord O'Shaughnessy told the BBC: ""We are doing everything we can to ensure patients continue to access the medications they need, and we have issued detailed guidance to healthcare professionals."" Mylan said Pfizer (which manufactures the drug) was ""working hard"" to increase production, and supply would stabilise between October and December this year. Follow Alex on Twitter.",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45653279,"Diet replacement programmes made up of low-calorie soups, shakes and regular counselling should be a recommended NHS treatment for obesity, a BMJ study says. People on the diets lost three times more weight than those given standard dietary advice by their GP, University of Oxford researchers found. And their risk of developing heart disease and type-2 diabetes reduced. But experts said it would work only if eating habits were changed for good. Prof Paul Aveyard, study author, GP and professor of behavioural medicine at the University of Oxford, said losing weight and keeping it off was hard. ""It's boring being on a normal diet and people struggle to stick to it for a year,"" he said. ""But these programmes get you when your mental strength is at its highest. ""You have to concentrate effort into 12 weeks and because they eat so little, they lose a lot of weight quickly."" Total diet replacement programmes are designed for people who are obese or seriously obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30, who have been unable to lose weight despite changes to diet and lifestyle. They are currently only available privately - although NHS England has said it is considering the diets as part of a long-term plan for the NHS. The programmes reduce daily calorie intake by replacing food with specially formulated drinks, soups and snacks. Milk, water and fibre supplements are also taken. A typical daily intake might include: In this study, of 278 people from 10 GP practices in Oxfordshire, half followed the Cambridge Weight Plan programme for eight weeks - limiting intake to 810kcal per day - then re-introduced other food gradually over the next four weeks. They also saw a trained counsellor every week, for 24 weeks in total, to help them stick to the diet and keep the weight off. The other half of participants were given the usual weight management advice and support from their GP practice. At every stage of the study, people following the diet replacement programme lost more weight. After a year, they had lost on average 1st 9lb (10.7kg) compared with half a stone (3.1kg) for those in the usual weight loss group. When their blood pressure and cholesterol was measured, there were also noticeable improvements. And those with type-2 diabetes were able to radically reduce their medication, although the study found no evidence of the condition being reversed. One in four adults in the UK is obese and the number of people being diagnosed with type-2 diabetes is on the rise. Last year, a trial of patients with type-2 diabetes given a low-calorie diet of shakes and soups found half were able to lose enough weight to reverse the condition.  It is often said that losing weight quickly on these types of programmes might lead to the weight piling back on again - but the researchers said the study showed this wasn't the case. Prof Aveyard said the programme was an ""effective intervention which GPs can confidently recommend, knowing that it leads to sustainable weight loss and lowers the risk of heart disease and diabetes"". Dr Barbara McGowan, a member of the Society for Endocrinology, consultant endocrinologist and lead for medical obesity services at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, said: ""It has the potential to be scaled up across the NHS if found to be cost-effective as a treatment for obesity."" Dr Katarina Kos, a senior lecturer in diabetes and obesity at the University of Exeter Medical School, said people should not try one of these diets on their own, without any support. ""Of course losing weight is good if you are overweight but a large body of research indicates that the only way it will work is if using the programme as a means to future change, as a stepping stone to change eating habits for good,"" she said. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said she would like to see more research in this area. ""Of course, what works for one patient might not work for another,"" she said. ""And GPs will always aim to take into account the physical, psychological and social factors potentially impacting on a patient's health when giving them advice."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard said weight loss programmes should not be seen as the only option for patients. ""Ultimately, the best way to stay fit and healthy is to keep active, eat a healthy and balanced diet, get enough sleep, drink moderately in accordance with guidelines, and not smoke,"" she said. The trial was funded in part by Cambridge Weight Plan UK. Jane Moore from Northampton used the weight loss programme trialled in the study. ""This has enraged me. The first time I used it I did indeed lose weight quickly, probably a stone in a few weeks, but as soon as you return to normal eating the weight creeps back on.  ""This type of 'diet' does nothing to educate overweight people long term, and simply encourages unhealthy yo-yo dieting in my opinion.  ""In addition I developed gallstones and was hospitalised with jaundice and pancreatitis as a result of them fragmenting.  ""When I had my gallbladder removed, my consultant believed that yo-yo dieting contributed to me developing these problems. ""I am delighted to say that through healthy eating I have now lost three-and-a-half stone and have kept this off for over two years now.""  Karen Taylor, and her daughter Jess, from Aylesbury, used the same diet plan with impressive results. ""Jess has lost just over three stone and I have lost seven stone since January this year.  ""I have suffered with my weight for many years and since childhood. I overate when pregnant with Jess, comfort ate when my marriage broke down and continued to sabotage myself with food for years, all the while thinking food was my friend.

The work, by Professor James P Allison from the US and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan, has led to treatments for advanced, deadly skin cancer.  Immune checkpoint therapy has revolutionised cancer treatment, said the prize-giving Swedish Academy.   Experts say it has proved to be ""strikingly effective"".  Prof Allison, of the University of Texas, and Prof Honjo, of Kyoto University, will share the Nobel prize sum of nine million Swedish kronor - about $1.01 million or 870,000 euros. Accepting the prize, Tasuku Honjo told reporters: ""I want to continue my research ... so that this immune therapy will save more cancer patients than ever."" Prof Allison said: ""It's a great, emotional privilege to meet cancer patients who've been successfully treated with immune checkpoint blockade. They are living proof of the power of basic science, of following our urge to learn and to understand how things work."" Our immune system protects us from disease, but it has built-in safeguards to stop it from attacking our own tissue.  Some cancers can take advantage of those ""brakes"" and dodge the attack too. Allison and Honjo, now both in their 70s, discovered a way to unleash our immune cells to attack tumours by turning off proteins that put the brakes on.  And that led to the development of new drugs which now offer hope to patients with advanced and previously untreatable cancer.  Immune checkpoint therapy is being used by the NHS to treat people with the most serious form of skin cancer, melanoma. It doesn't work for everyone, but for some patients it appears to have worked incredibly well, getting rid of the tumour entirely, even after it had started to spread around the body.  Such remarkable results had never been seen before for patients like these. Doctors have also been using the treatment to help some people with advanced lung cancer.  Prof Charles Swanton, from Cancer Research UK, congratulated the prize winners, saying: ""Thanks to this groundbreaking work, our own immune system's innate power against cancer has been realised and harnessed into treatments that continue to save the lives of patients. For cancers such as advanced melanoma, lung, and kidney, these immune-boosting drugs have transformed the outlook for many patients who had run out of options.  ""The booming field of immunotherapy that these discoveries have precipitated is still relatively in its infancy, so it's exciting to consider how this research will progress in the future and what new opportunities will arise."" Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes awarded each year. The literature prize will not be handed out this year, after the awarding body was affected by a sexual misconduct scandal. 2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm or body clock 2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cells remain healthy by recycling waste. 2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi ≈åmura and Youyou Tu for anti-parasite drug discoveries. 2014 - John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser for discovering the brain's navigating system. 2013 - James Rothman, Randy Schekman, and Thomas Sudhof for their discovery of how cells precisely transport material. 2012 - Two pioneers of stem cell research - John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka - were awarded the Nobel after changing adult cells into stem cells. 2011 - Bruce Beutler, Jules Hoffmann and Ralph Steinman shared the prize after revolutionising the understanding of how the body fights infection. 2010 - Robert Edwards for devising the fertility treatment IVF which led to the first ""test tube baby"" in July 1978. 2009 - Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak for finding the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes.",,,,

Ciara Williams, who is 23, has had allergies since she was a baby. Her mother - who also has allergies - recognised the symptoms when Ciara was given milk. ""I came out in hives but luckily a healthcare visitor was at home when it happened,"" added Ciara, from Flintshire.  ""When I got a bit older, I also became allergic to eggs and nuts.  ""With milk it can take between five and 10 minutes before I start getting the symptoms. But with eggs it can take up to two hours, which can lull you into a false sense of security."" In the last few years Ciara has also developed an intolerance to latex on fruit such as bananas, kiwi fruit and strawberries.  ""Even if I touch a food I'm allergic to, I swell up and get hives and feel very uncomfortable,"" she explained.   Fortunately the only time Ciara has experienced a serious reaction was when she was having controlled hospital tests to determine the severity of her allergies.  ""I felt sick and drowsy,"" she said. ""My throat closed up quickly, I had severe abdominal cramps, and then became unconscious.  ""When I came to, I vomited and went straight into another episode."" Scrutinising food labels is a chore that Ciara has become used to.  ""It makes you extremely wary about everything you eat and you have to watch out for any changes in the ingredients, just in case it contains something you are allergic to.""  Talking to new people about allergies can also be frustrating for her.  ""It's sometimes hard to explain to those who haven't got allergies how important it is to know what is in food,"" she explained. ""My allergies are life-threatening and it can be hard to get that message across to people."" However, she has shown her close friends how to use an EpiPen - an adrenaline auto-injector, and she always carries two of them with her. Dining at restaurants provides fresh challenges, and Ciara always tries to check online or phone a restaurant in advance to find out about the ingredients.

Ciara has been involved with the Easy to Ask campaign, which aims to encourage young people not to be embarrassed to quiz restaurants about possible allergens.

It was the accident that changed not only her life, but also those of thousands of other disabled people in Morocco and beyond.  Amina came from a wealthy family so could afford the treatment she needed, but she realised that most of her fellow Moroccans could not.  So she decided to set up a disability rehabilitation centre. Seventeen years later, the centre she created with a few colleagues has helped 26,000 people receive treatment, equipment and support.  ""At the beginning everybody would laugh, saying you're crazy, you're a bunch of crippled people, you have no money, and you think you're going to build a rehabilitation centre? And we said yes,"" says Amina. We are talking and moving down the corridor at the Noor rehabilitation centre in Casablanca, the flagship centre of her organisation, Group AMH.  On both sides of the corridor are spacious rooms where patients are lifting weights, loud music is blaring out.  ""People who have insurance or have money pay for people who don't,"" she says, explaining the innovative way the organisation funds treatment for people who could not normally afford it.  ""We have one free patient for five who pay, and this model allowed us to be independent after four or five years, and generate profits which we reinvest to keep helping people."" One of those people is Fatiha Ait Mohamed. She was paralysed after falling while cleaning the steps of her house. The group covered 80% of the costs of her rehab and bought her a specially adapted motorbike.  She rides it every day to buy cosmetic supplies which she then sells in a small street stand. ""When I was in bed and my mum was doing everything for me, I was feeling like I was living in a different world, I couldn't feel my body. I wasn't feeling that I was in this life."" ""I love riding my motorbike, I now feel free."" she says. Every day, around 120 disabled people arrive at Amina's offices seeking help for everything from rehabilitation to prosthetics and psychological support.  ""What's really innovative about Groupe AMH is that they try to cover everything, not just rehabilitation,"" says Ahmed Ait Brahim, director of social integration at the Moroccan Ministry of Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development.  ""They want to make sure that disabled people are reintegrated into society; that's really unique across Africa.""

Amina's group now also has a school to integrate disabled children in more inclusive settings - crucial in a country where less than half of disabled children go to school. Khadija, eight, has cerebral palsy and attends the school. She lives with her parents in a tiny room her family rents near the clinic. They moved more than a year ago from Marrakesh so she could get the help she needed.  ""When I was there I didn't have friends. Only when I came here I started to have friends, When I began getting better, I started to feel something inside, something that made me very happy,"" she says. Amina's group covers most of Khadija's rehabilitation costs. Her parents explain how she used to be very angry, and spent most of the time lying down on her back in bed. But now she can draw, play with other children and even stands up on her own.  Back at the clinic, we spot Amina in a meeting with senior managers of the organisation. Despite their success, the group's innovative financial model is at risk and they are discussing future strategies. The challenge is that private clinics are planning to open competing luxury rehab pay facilities for well-off disabled patients. They are the ones currently funding treatment and support those who cannot pay, like Fatiha and Khadija.  But that is not the only problem.

But purchasing power keeps decreasing and we don't get any government support, so we need to become more and more creative on how to generate funds,"" Amina says. Recently the clinic opened a new wing with 20 individual rooms for wealthy patients. It is also attracting more and more wealthy patients from across Africa where rehabilitation options are very limited or do not exist at all.  They come mainly from Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guinea, attracted by the proximity and the fact that treatment is 10 times cheaper than in France or elsewhere in Europe. ""Time goes fast, it's now been 25 years. The team is here and engaged, but for how long?"" says Amina.  ""Our goal is to ensure that when we go, what we've done doesn't disappear. We're going to open another hospital near Casablanca and if it works, we'll open many other rehab centres.  ""We want to be the leader of rehabilitation in Africa.""

Health ministry spokesman Iraj Harirchi said 16 people had gone blind and 170 had undergone dialysis after trying the tainted drink.  In the past three weeks, at least 460 people across five provinces have been hospitalised, with the youngest victim a 19-year-old woman.  Alcohol is illegal in Iran but bootleg booze is widespread. However, ethanol is sometimes reportedly replaced with toxic methanol in the contaminated drink. Police in the southern city of Bandar Abbas last week arrested a couple for allegedly producing home-made alcohol. BBC Persian's Rana Rahimpour says it is not unusual for tainted alcohol to cause injuries or deaths in Iran, but what is surprising is the significant numbers of deaths and the spread of the problem to a number of provinces. Analysts spoken to by the BBC's Persian service believe the economic impact of the US pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal may be playing a part. With the collapse in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar, people may be turning to cheap, homemade alcohol over expensive foreign imports.  Iranian anti-drugs officials believe that every year 80 million litres of alcohol worth $730 million (¬£559m) is smuggled into Iran. Iranian Muslims have been barred from drinking alcohol since the country's revolution in 1979. Article 265 of Iran's Islamic penal code states that the punishment for consumption of alcohol by a Muslim is 80 lashes. There is however an exemption for non-Muslim citizens to produce alcohol for their own consumption or for religious purposes, like the Eucharist.",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45703499,"Ray Lakeman is only too aware of the effect of illegal drugs. His two sons Jacques and Torin died after they took ecstasy together four years ago. Now, the dad is advocating a more open approach to tackle the issue of illegal drug use - an approach that has seen Sheffield Students' Union hit the headlines in recent days. The union has been publishing advice on how to take illegal drugs safely.  ""I think it's acknowledging what's going on and trying to keep students safe. It's realistic,"" says Mr Lakeman. ""I don't condone drug-taking but I know it happens. Universities need to be open and honest."" Mr Lakeman's sons took ecstasy together after travelling to Manchester to watch a football match. Torin was 19 and in his second year at Aberystwyth University at the time. His brother was a year older and working in London. Mr Lakeman knew his eldest son had been dabbling in drugs but believes Torin had only tried drugs after starting university. ""If it happened to Torin when he was so opposed to drugs in the past it can happen to anyone,"" he says. ""I think things changed for him when he went to university. I think it was just a way of fitting in and coping."" But should universities instead be focusing on stopping students taking drugs in the first place? The guidance provided by Sheffield Students' Union - such as how to take safe dosages and how much water to drink - comes from the Loop, an external organisation which runs initiatives to reduce the harm caused by drugs. The union's welfare officer Katharine Swindells denies the approach is normalising or promoting drug use.  ""Although drugs misuse is of course not condoned at Sheffield, we have to be realistic that some students will experiment with drugs,"" she says. ""We have a responsibility to ensure that if a student does choose to take drugs they are as informed as possible and know how to take all reasonable precautions."" A spokesman for the University of Sheffield echoed the union's position. However, National Drug Prevention Alliance spokesman David Raynes says the union's advice is ""normalising drug taking"".  ""It creates a climate where there's an expectation that students will use drugs. And that is bad because we'll then get to a climate where more students take drugs rather than less,"" he says. He believes ""social pressure and peer pressure"" - like that which saw a significant decline in smoking at the beginning of the 21st Century - is needed to deter students from taking illegal substances. While many drug awareness charities do offer advice to people who are going to take drugs they also emphasise the ""safest thing to do is not take drugs at all"". Around two in five students use illegal drugs, a recent survey by the National Union of Students (NUS) suggests. The most widely used drug is cannabis, followed by ecstasy or MDMA, nitrous oxide and cocaine.  Rob Noon, an officer at the NUS, said a range of support and information should be provided to help students who use drugs to make more informed choices.  Punitive measures rarely helped potentially vulnerable students from seeking help and support ""at the very time they need it,"" he says.  Buckingham University has taken a different approach. It aims to be the UK's first drug-free campus and plans to ask students to sign contracts promising not to take illegal substances on its premises.  Two years ago the university also started inviting police sniffer dogs on campus in a crack-down on drugs. But vice-chancellor Sir Anthony Seldon insists the policy is focused on the welfare of students rather than being punitive. ""We are not looking to throw anybody out with a drug problem but to give them help to get off it. ""It's based upon the fact that if you are part of a university where drugs taking isn't the norm you are much less likely to take them."" He says while he isn't opposed to providing students with advice about how to take drugs safely he felt there were better ways to tackle the issue.  ""That approach seems to be admitting there's a problem but trying to limit the damage rather than addressing the cause.  ""It should be coupled with a real drive to say we really do not think drug-taking is necessary."" He admits the university is unlikely to ""stamp drugs out altogether"" but hoped tackling the social acceptability would significantly reduce drug-use on campus. But Ms Swindells says students also need to be made aware of the risks if they do choose to take drugs. ""Providing advice doesn't promote drug use,"" she says. ""It keeps people safe.""

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45711410,"It's something many people have experienced at least once in their lives - a night of heavy drinking followed by a day of missing memories. A blackout. The amnesia caused by excessive alcohol consumption has become a topic of discussion in the wake of sexual assault allegations against US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. One of the accusers says Judge Kavanaugh tried to force himself on her at a party when he was drunk, 36 years ago. A second woman says he exposed himself to her during a college drinking game. Mr Kavanaugh strongly denies the accusations, and some have suggested that he could have suffered a blackout from alcohol, which he also rejects. It's when our brain fails to record memories of events that take place while we're drinking.  That happens because circuits in the brain area that plays a key role in consolidating memories of our day-to-day lives, the hippocampus, are shut down by alcohol, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) in the US. This results in gaps in the record-keeping system. There are two types of blackouts:  Fragmentary blackouts are very common, studies say, especially among young drinkers. ""Anywhere from 30% to 50% of young adults who drink do report some experience with an alcohol-related blackout,"" says Dr Kate Carey, professor of behavioural and social sciences at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. They're triggered when an individual's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) rises quickly and reaches a high level. This can happen as a result of consuming large amounts of alcohol in a short time, doing shots or drinking on an empty stomach. A blackout starts when a person's BAC is around 0.2, experts say. For comparison, in the US, it's illegal to drive with a BAC of 0.08. (Limits are different in the UK.) Studies suggest that blackouts are more common in individuals with lower body weight and in women. That's because women's blood alcohol level rises faster after each drink as a result of having less water in the body.  A genetic component could also explain why some people seem to be more susceptible to blackouts than others. Some experts also say people who smoke or use other recreational drugs while drinking are more likely to blackout from alcohol. Not necessarily, says Dr Carey. As the short-term functions are quite robust against the impact of alcohol intoxication, someone may be awake and functional, even citing things that have taken place before the blackout, she adds. But they just won't remember it. Some people, however, may show some signs including distraction or the inability to continue a conversation, for example. According to the American Addiction Centers, individuals can choose to participate in risky behaviours that they may not perform when sober, due to impaired decision-making. That could be driving a car, getting into a fight or committing - or being the victim of - a sexual assault or other crime, says the NIAA. Apart from memory loss, constant blackouts may suggest a drinking disorder, which can lead to long-term health issues such as liver problems. No. Passing out is when someone is asleep or unconscious from excessive drinking.",,,,

When Isley Lynn recalls her first sexual experience as a teenager she describes it as a non-starter. ""I found it really heartbreaking. I felt like I was broken. I felt at fault for something that wasn't my fault."" While many of us can probably relate to the awkwardness and clumsiness of a first sexual encounter, Isley's reaction was the result of a little talked about condition. Isley, now 30, still has vaginismus and is touring her play, Skin a Cat, which is all about her experiences. The NHS defines vaginismus as the body's automatic reaction to the fear of some or all types of vaginal penetration. The vaginal muscles tighten up and the woman has no control over it. Someone with it may find it hard inserting a tampon, struggle to have sex or feel a burning or stinging pain. Isley says: ""I tried my first tampon when I was 10 years old. It was excruciating, it felt like there was no hole, like there was a wall in front of where a hole should be. ""I knew something was seriously wrong after my first boyfriend."" The condition has also had a big emotional bearing on Isley's relationships.  ""I remember feeling really afraid that partners maybe thought I just wasn't in love with them or I wasn't physically attracted to them,"" she says. The playwright was diagnosed with vaginismus in her late teens and was treated with vaginal trainers which slowly increase in size to try to relax the muscles, and physiotherapy.  Isley says that after attempting the treatments, she soon realised they weren't working and that ""being fixed"" wasn't the solution to her long term happiness. ""It was a therapist that stopped me and asked me how much did I want to be normalised. ""And it's that conversation you see in the final scene of the play. This character is asked to define what she wants from her sex life.  ""She realises she doesn't have to have a sex life like everyone else's to enjoy it.   ""That you write your own script in life and should do what makes you happy."" If you're affected by any of these issues you might find useful information on the BBC Advice pages. It's difficult to estimate how many women in UK have vaginismus although a recent survey suggested nearly one in 10 British women finds sex painful. Although this could be down to a number of different reasons - vaginismus being just one of them. ""Vaginismus is different from just pain during sex because it's the body's automatic reaction that causes it,"" explains Dr Vanessa Mackay, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.  ""It's probably difficult to put a number on how many women have it because the majority of women who are suffering sexual problems just don't talk about it,"" Dr Mackay added. In addition to addressing the physical side of the condition treatment also focuses on the mental side, the fear of penetration.  Psycho-sexual counselling is often also used explains Dr Mackay: ""It's a sort of talking therapy helping you understand and changing your feelings towards your body.  ""Things like relaxation techniques to help you learn to relax your vaginal muscles. Pelvic floor exercises are also something that can be used to treat vaginismus.  ""And we prescribe vaginal trainers too, these are smooth tampon-shaped objects, that come in different widths that make you get used to having something in your vagina."" Teresa, 23, also has vaginismus and says after being diagnosed she was offered a variety of different treatments. ""One counsellor suggested I try hypnosis which in a dark moment I did try but it didn't work for me at all. I'm a bit of a sceptic so the whole time I was there I was like, 'This isn't going to work for me',"" Teresa says.  She adds: ""The one thing that did work for me is graded dilators where you just teach yourself to relax using them. ""Life today is pretty good, I don't worry about it on a day to day basis. I'm pretty chilled, pretty happy. It was difficult at the beginning but I think once you find your own solution it's easy from there.""

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-45727977,"Australia will become the first country to effectively eliminate cervical cancer if vaccination and screening rates are maintained, researchers say. The disease could be eradicated as a public health issue nationally within 20 years, according to new modelling. It is predicted to be classified as a ""rare cancer"" in Australia by 2022, when it should drop to less than six cases per 100,000 people. Scientists attribute the progress to national prevention programmes. In 2007, Australia became one of the first countries to introduce a Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination scheme for girls. The programme was later extended to boys. It complemented a national screening programme that began in 1991. The new modelling was published by the Cancer Council New South Wales (NSW), a charity, in The Lancet Public Health Journal on Wednesday. Cervical cancer is caused by ""high-risk"" types of HPV, a sexually transmitted infection. It is the fourth-most frequent cancer in women and has a high mortality rate globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Australia's current annual cervical cancer rate stands at seven cases per 100,000 people, about half the global average. The study predicted that annual cases in Australia would drop to four in 100,000 by 2035 - a potential elimination threshold, the researchers suggested. The WHO has not yet established such a standard for when cervical cancer becomes so uncommon it is deemed eliminated. ""Regardless of what the [elimination] threshold is, it is likely Australia would be the first country to reach it given our current low rate of cervical cancer, and our strong prevention programmes,"" Dr Megan Smith, a researcher from Cancer Council NSW told the BBC. Last year, Australia replaced its routine screening standards for the cancer - a pap smear examination - with more sensitive HPV cervical screening tests. Researchers have estimated that the switch to the new test, conducted only every five years, will reduce cancer rates by at least 20%. According to the WHO, about nine in 10 deaths from cervical cancer happen in low and middle-income countries. ‚Ä¢HPV is the name given to a common group of viruses; there are more than 100 types of HPV ‚Ä¢Many women will be with infected with HPV over the course of their lifetime without any ill-effect  ‚Ä¢In the vast majority of cases, there will be no symptoms and the infection will clear on its own, but in some cases persistent infection can lead to cervical disease  ‚Ä¢Some types of HPV are high risk because they are linked to the development of some cancers ‚Ä¢Other lower risk HPV types can lead to genital warts  ‚Ä¢Nearly all cervical cancers (99.7%) are caused by infection from a high risk HPV ‚Ä¢The HPV vaccine protects against four types of HPV which cause around 80% of cervical cancer and the vast majority of genital warts Source: NHS Choices",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45720970,"Regularly eating foods like bacon and sausages may raise the risk of breast cancer, according to researchers.  A review of studies found women who ate high levels of processed meat had a 9% increased risk of the cancer compared with those who ate little of it.  The study backs up previous findings of the World Health Organization, which says processed meats cause cancer.  Experts recommend caution about the findings and say the actual risk for individual women is ""very small"". This review, which included data on more than a million women, shows a link between processed meat consumption and breast cancer risk, but it's not clear if the food is actually causing this.  There are also other pitfalls to consider. The 15 studies used in the analysis had different definitions of the highest consumptions. For example, one of the UK studies in the review classed high consumption as more than 9g a day - the equivalent of just two or three rashers a week - while in others it was much higher. The researchers in the majority of these studies noted what people said they ate and followed them up to see which of them developed breast cancer. But the problem with this is that people who eat different amounts of processed meat may also have other behaviours that might explain the differences in breast cancer risk, such as being more or less healthy in other ways. In the UK about 14 out of every 100 women will get breast cancer at some point in their lives. That means a 9% increase in risk in this population would be expected to translate into roughly one extra case of cancer in every 100 women. Cancer Research UK estimates that about 23% of breast cancers are preventable. It estimates that about 8% of cases are caused by being overweight and obese and another 8% by alcohol. Authors of this study, published in the International Journal of Cancer, say the link they found is only for processed meat, not red meat. The WHO lists processed meat as carcinogenic, primarily because of evidence linking it to a raised risk of bowel cancer, while it says red meat is ""probably carcinogenic"". Processed meat has been modified to either extend its shelf life or change the taste, usually by smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives to meat. This includes bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky and ham. There are different theories for why it may raise the risk of cancer, including that curing salt may react with protein in the meat to make it carcinogenic.  Lead author Dr Maryam Farvid, of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in the US, recommends cutting down on the meat rather than eliminating it.  Currently, the NHS recommends eating no more than 70g of red and processed meat a day. Dr Gunter Kuhnle, associate professor in nutrition and health at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the study, said it was ""questionable"" whether people should lower their red and processed meat consumption on the back of this study.  He said the actual risk posed by processed meats was ""very small"" for the individual and more relevant on a population-wide level.  However, he said the study's findings should be followed up to investigate the links between processed meat and cancer and see whether the associated risk could be reduced, for example through new food production methods.

Thousands across the UK are set to do just that as part of Go Sober for October, in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support.  Apart from raising money for a good cause, the charity suggests participants may also benefit from less snoring, better sleep, and increased energy.  Similar benefits are promised for Dry January, organised by Alcohol Concern, which is now something of an annual ritual for many as a way of recovering from the excesses of the festive period. According to a recent YouGov poll, 5 million of us had a Dry January in 2017. It was once thought that light drinking was harmless - and maybe even beneficial, but recent research seem to have put paid to that theory.  One study,  published in The Lancet, suggested there is no safe level of alcohol consumption and the more you drink, the higher your risk. No surprise then that many of us are calling time at the bar, at least for a few weeks of the year.  Trust Me I'm a Doctor teamed up with scientists from University College London and the Royal Free Hospital, led by liver specialist Prof Rajiv Jalan. He's looked into the health benefits of doing dry January before.  The problem is that people normally give up alcohol as part of a New Year health kick - which means they also tend to exercise more and eat more healthily, making it difficult to know whether it's the lack of alcohol alone that's conferring the health benefit. So we chose July. We divided a group of 26 volunteers into a group who would carry on drinking as normal, while the rest gave up booze altogether. They were given full health checks at the beginning and the end of the month, including blood pressure and liver checks. Surprisingly, given that it tends to be a month that's full of parties, BBQs and weddings, there was only the odd slip-up. When we tested them at the end, the health of all those who gave up alcohol improved - liver fat and overall weight fell, and their quality of sleep and concentration improved. The effect was more pronounced among those who usually drank over the government's recommended limit of 14 units a week - equivalent to around six glasses of wine or six pints of beer. Kathy, one of those who cut out booze for the month, said: ""After the four weeks, I felt like a different person. I don't drink hardly anything any more, I feel absolutely amazing, I feel revitalised. ""I'm still losing weight, and I'm just loving the way that I feel. And I cannot stand the smell of alcohol now!"" Prof Jalan's team were also keen to see if the people would undo their good work by going back to the booze, so the volunteers were retested three weeks after they had started drinking again. There was a clear divide between the light drinkers, who stuck to the government guidelines for alcohol, and those who regularly drank more.  The light drinkers soon went back to drinking their previous drinking levels.  But the heavy drinkers were still drinking 70% less three weeks afterwards.  While this study involved only a small number of people, our results did seem to suggest that cutting drink in the short term did improve the health markers we measured. If you're a light drinker, the reduction in your risk of contracting an alcohol-related disease is already low and giving up alcohol for a month will only result in a slight risk reduction. More research is needed, but the fact that our heavy-drinking volunteers were still drinking significantly less three weeks after returning to alcohol suggests that temporarily abstaining might help people to evaluate their relationship with alcohol and drink less in the future.

Currently, tampons and sanitary pads are sold with a 10% goods and services tax (GST) because they are categorised as non-essential items. Women have argued it is an unfair classification, noting items such as condoms and sunscreen are exempt. Federal and state governments agreed on Wednesday to remove the levy. ""We're really delighted that everyone's come on board to scrap what is an unfair tax,"" Minister for Women Kelly O'Dwyer told Sky News Australia. ""Millions of women right across the nation will be very thankful for it."" Widely known as the ""tampon tax"", the levy on sanitary products has drawn protests since the GST was introduced in 2000.

""Now I have got to the point in my life where I'm proud to say who I am: I'm British-Pakistani, Muslim, gay and living with HIV. I just want to say to someone, 'You understand, right? How difficult it is as a Muslim and being HIV positive?'""  Waraich was diagnosed with HIV in October 2013. He had a hard time reconciling being Muslim and gay and this affected how he received his diagnosis. ""I felt so much shame and guilt around it,"" he says. ""HIV is seen as a gay man's disease. In the Asian community, there is this perception that this is a sinful thing. I internalised that homophobia, and thought, 'I deserved that - this is probably my destiny, I'm going to die young and go to hell.'"" He remembers the day he got his diagnosis at a sexual health clinic in East London.  ""I had gone in to get tested for something else. That's when it came back that I had HIV and my world just fell apart,"" says Waraich.  The health advisor at the clinic spoke to him for 40 minutes, but he couldn't absorb any of it.  ""I don't even remember what he said, I was scared to face the reality of it. I just wanted the ground to swallow me up."" Waraich kept his diagnosis to himself for two years. ""I isolated myself. I didn't tell anyone - only my doctor and a counsellor knew. Having this secret took me to some dark places, and I almost contemplated ending my life."" Now Waraich works in sexual health education, as an outreach worker for the Terrence Higgins Trust. He feels it is important to speak out. ""I never saw stories of people of colour who had contracted HIV,"" he says. Recently, Waraich decided to tell his parents about his HIV status. He had been worried about telling them for years. ""My mum was really supportive. She said, in Urdu, 'I love you as my son, whatever you bring to my doorstep, I will support you regardless.' ""It was such a relief to tell her. I was expecting her to ask me questions, like if I was going to die, but she was just very loving."" His older brother and his sister-in-law, Saier and Rabia, have also been supportive. ""Rabia has always been able to sense when things are a bit iffy with my mental health. When I told them about the HIV diagnosis, she said, 'Why didn't you just tell us? We could have been there for you.'"" But at the time, he says no-one could have helped him because he was not ready. It has taken him five years to accept the support he was offered and be confident to talk about it. Waraich says he was ""freaking out"" about coming out as gay to his parents a few years ago.   ""I actually told my dad in the hardware store,"" he says. ""We were looking at drill bits and I was plucking up the courage. I thought, 'I have to do it here, it's a really manly place.'  ""I wanted to do it in that moment because we were in public. I was thinking, 'OK, he probably won't shout at me or get angry at me here - or maybe he will and pick up a hammer and smash me on the head!' All of these surreal thoughts were going through my mind. But he was so great, my Dad was so supportive."" His mother, he says, was more shocked by his tattoos than by his coming out.  ""I was wearing a vest in the summer - rookie mistake. Mum started shouting, 'You know that is haram [forbidden] in our religion, you're going to be burnt in Jahannam [hell] for that!' Not everyone in his family has been understanding - recently he came out as gay to a cousin. Her reaction was, ""Oh that's wrong.""  ""I wasn't really upset by her reaction,"" says Waraich. ""I just said, 'I'm going to teach you because you don't know any better - I didn't choose to be gay. I was born this way.'"" Most of the time, Waraich will tell people about his sexuality but withhold his HIV status.  ""Coming out again and again is painful and emotional. I've come out so much in my life, and now I have to come out about my HIV status. ""I've learned to not be defensive, but to go into educational mode. But it puts the onus on me. I find myself having to comfort someone else who is finding it hard to deal with - 'Oh my God, you're HIV positive, I'm really sorry,' and then I have to comfort them."" Now that Waraich has told everyone in his personal life, he's on a mission to educate others in the South Asian community.  ""Sexual health clinics do amazing work, but for Asians it's a struggle to get through the door,"" he says.  He knows this from experience. Despite living as an openly gay man after moving to London in 2010, and being well-informed about HIV, he found it hard to overcome the stigma.  ""Most gay men are quite clocked on, going to get tested regularly. In my experience, people of colour are like, 'What if my mum sees that? What if it comes up on my Internet history?' People are still very nervous about talking about those things.  ""I could have protected myself. I knew about HIV, but I was so ashamed of going to the clinic, I buried my head in the sand.""  Sources: Public Health England, Black and minority ethnic men who have sex with men It's still very difficult for Asians to talk to each other about sex, says Waraich - partly because they lack the right language.  ""In Urdu for instance, we don't have a word for sex or sexuality or LGBT even though these cultures exist in Pakistan. If there is a word, it's derogatory and I don't want to be known as that."" And with conversations not being had about sex, there are even fewer conversations about sexual health.  Waraich is aware that South Asian patients might be hesitant to speak to him. ""They might feel judged, or think that I might know their auntie or something. Sometimes they don't want to share things but I tell them, 'This is your health, we want YOU to know where you are so you're not affecting anyone else.' Waraich now knows what it takes to look after himself and remain healthy. ""A lot of people don't know that you can be on treatment and that it's not a death sentence. People have normal lives. It's just two pills a day. I set an alarm on my phone and it has just become part of my routine. I am 'undetectable' which means that I cannot pass it to a partner - but not everyone is able to grasp that concept."" Despite everything, he still occasionally struggles to reconcile his identity with his religious upbringing. ""I'm going to follow my religion on my own terms.

It found the impact on thinking skills, memory and behaviour was worse than that of teenage drinking. The researchers, from the University of Montreal, urged teenagers to delay their use of cannabis for as long as they felt able. The study tracked and tested 3,800 adolescents over four years, starting from around the age of 13. Drinking alcohol and taking drugs, such as cannabis, at a young age is known to cause problems with cognitive abilities such as learning, attention and decision-making as well as academic performance at school. This study found these problems increased as cannabis use increased - and the effects were lasting, unlike those of alcohol. The teenagers, from 31 different Canadian schools, gave details of their drug and drinking habits once a year. Their brain skills were also tested every year in school using computer-based cognitive tests.   Although levels of cannabis use in the study were low compared with alcohol use, 28% of the teenagers still admitted to some kind of use. This compared with 75% of the teenagers who said they drank alcohol at least occasionally.  Prof Patricia J Conrod, lead study author, from the department of psychiatry at Montreal, said she had expected alcohol to have had more of an impact on the teenagers' brains. But, instead, the research detected greater increases in errors in cognitive tests on the teenagers using cannabis - while they were taking the drug and after they had stopped. These effects were seen in working memory, reasoning and their ability to control their behaviour. ""Their brains are still developing but cannabis is interfering with that,"" Prof Conrod said, of teenagers. ""They should delay their use of cannabis as long as they can."" She also said the findings highlighted the importance of drug-prevention programmes. Cannabis is thought to be the most widely used illegal drug in the UK. It can be addictive and using it has been shown to increase the risk of developing psychotic illnesses, particularly in adolescents. Giving up cannabis can lead to withdrawal symptoms, such as sleeping problems and mood swings, experts say. The study is published in the American Journal of Psychiatry.",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45721670,"Could taking a placebo, a pill which contains nothing but ground rice, really help cure back pain?   Jim Pearce is certainly convinced. When we first met, the 71-year-old was confined to a wheelchair and using morphine because of his back pain. But after he took part in our study, taking our convincingly-labelled blue-and-white-striped ""new"" painkillers, he seemed like a different person. The only thing was that he'd been taking placebos; dummy pills - they contained nothing but ground rice. But they worked. ""I just woke up one morning and I thought, hang about, I haven't got a twinge in my back. And it's been going from strength to strength."" I asked him which he preferred, my pills or the morphine?   ""I got rid of the morphine and kept taking your blue pills."" Jim was one of 100 people who took part in a trial for our BBC2 Horizon programme: Can my brain cure my body? It was a back pain study - with a twist. The twist being that everyone, unknowingly, was getting placebo? We wanted to see if people taking the pills would get better anyway? The placebo effect is well studied but at the same time something of a mystery. The word placebo comes from the Latin ""I shall please"" and is associated with images of quack doctors selling dodgy cures.  Yet it is also an important part of modern clinical trials, where patients are given either a placebo (sometimes called a dummy pill) or an active drug (without knowing which is which) and researchers then look to see if the drug outperforms the placebo, or vice versa. With the help of Dr Jeremy Howick, an expert on the placebo effect from University of Oxford, we set out to see if we could cure real back pain with fake pills. It would be the largest experiment of its kind ever carried out in the UK, with 100 people from Blackpool taking part. Some were asked to act as a ""control"" group. The rest were told that they were taking part in a study - where they might receive the placebo or a powerful new painkiller.  What they weren't told was that they would all get placebos, capsules containing nothing but ground rice.   The pills were authentic looking and based on years of research. They were blue-and-white-striped, because that has been shown to have a greatest painkilling effect.  They came in bottles, carefully labelled, warning of potential side effects and sternly reminding patients to keep out of the hands of children. All very convincing. Before the trial, Jim told us: ""I'm not looking for miracles. It would be nice even if the pain went away a little bit, to give me more freedom. ""I'll try anything and if it works, I'll love you forever!"" We chose Blackpool because one in five people there is blighted by their back. Chronic back pain is both common and hard to treat.  All our volunteers had suffered for years and felt their current medication wasn't up to the job.  When they came to us, they were randomly split into two groups. One group received no more than nine minutes and 22 seconds with the GP to discuss their back before being given a supply of pills and hustled out - that's the length of an average GP consultation The other group was given more than twice as long.  We wanted to see whether spending a bit more time with a GP makes a measurable difference. Now, many people believe that the placebo effect is a con and that it only works on the gullible.  But that's not what the science shows. A recent small study looking at the characteristics of back pain sufferers who responded best to placebo treatment, found those who were most ""aware"" and ""open to new experiences"" had the most benefit.  The researchers also carried out brain scans and found anatomical differences in the ""responders"" and ""non-responders"".  Among other things they found subtle differences in areas of the brain, like the amygdala, which controls emotion and reward, What exactly this means, no-one quite knows.   But University of Oxford's Prof Irene Tracey told us that just because a placebo contains no active chemicals, does not mean the effects of taking it are not real,"" she said. ""The average person thinks that placebo is something that's a lie or some fakery, something where the person has been tricked and it isn't real.   ""But science has told us, particularly over the last two decades, that it is something that is very real, it's something that we can see played out in our physiology and neurochemistry."" Among other things, research has shown that taking a placebo can trigger the release of endorphins - natural painkillers that are similar in structure to morphine. When we returned to Blackpool after three weeks, our volunteers went through another round of tests and questionnaires. And we found half of them had found significant relief from taking the pills - even though they were fake.  As well as Jim, we spoke to Joe, who had told me his back sometimes gets so bad, he had to have morphine and ketamine ""to get me out of the house"". He said he hadn't felt a twinge since he started on the pills. In fact, nearly half of our volunteers reported a medically significant improvement in their back pain.  Considering that, between them, they have tried every painkiller from Tramadol to morphine, I think that is pretty amazing.   And the time they spent with the doctor had a substantial effect on the outcome, with people benefitting from having a longer consultation with their GP. So where does this leave modern medicine?  A recent article in the British Medical Journal suggests that it can be ethical to prescribe placebos, as long as doctors are honest about what they are doing.  It pointed out there is mounting evidence, from a number of small trials, that placebos can work even when patients know that they are taking them.  That way, you can get the benefits of pain control without the often significant side effects of taking a ""real"" drug.

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45731191,"A second British woman has died from ""Brazilian butt lift"" surgery, the BBC has learned, as fresh warnings come over the risks. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (Baaps) said it was the most dangerous cosmetic procedure to undergo. The surgery has been made popular by celebrities. But many people are putting themselves at risk by seeking cheaper procedures abroad, Baaps warned. A Brazilian butt lift (BBL) is a cosmetic procedure in which fat is taken from one part of the body and then injected into the buttocks. Baaps told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme an estimated one in 3,000 die worldwide as a result of complications. In August, 29-year-old Leah Cambridge died while undergoing a BBL procedure in Turkey. A second British woman in her late 20s, also died this year, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned. An inquest into her death is due to happen within the next year. Gerard Lambe, consultant plastic surgeon and Baaps member, explained: ""It has the highest death rate of all procedures due to the risk of injecting fat into large veins in the buttocks, that can travel to the heart or brain."" One 23-year-old woman from Wales - who did not wish to be named - said she had been left scarred for life after having BBL surgery in February in Turkey. Three months after the procedure, infected holes appeared on her buttocks. ""I couldn't walk properly for ages,"" she said. ""To be honest, when the holes came it was better as the fat was leaking out, which made it possible to walk again."" She said her buttocks were leaking for three months, ""soaking all my clothes"". She added: ""It smelled. I had to bandage it up every day. ""I honestly wish I could go back. I was happy with my body before. And now I paid a stupid amount of money to look like this."" Women who have undergone BBL surgery abroad have had to seek NHS treatment as a result of it going wrong, which Baaps estimates is costing the Health Service thousands of pounds. It has calculated that serious complications - including pulmonary embolus, fat necrosis and abscess - that require time in hospital can cost more than ¬£13,000 per patient. Those affected require an average hospital stay of 20 days, it suggested, based on data at one hospital. Cheryl Palmer-Hughes, a solicitor from Irwin Mitchell specialising in claims arising from cosmetic surgery abroad, said the number of girls inquiring about BBL complications is growing. ""Some patients have had skin grafts, [others] have had significant periods of time off work and some have suffered psychological issues,"" she said. ""Complaints also include having fat transferred to the wrong area of the body - for example, to the thighs rather than the buttocks."" A second woman who spoke to the BBC anonymously said she went to Turkey for BBL surgery two years ago because ""the cost was a lot cheaper [than in the UK]"". She only met the surgeon for the first time 10 minutes before being put under general anaesthetic.  A few days later she had a really high fever, but when she tried to talk to the surgeon and nurses she says they stopped responding to her emails and texts. She was admitted to hospital in the UK, and had to take a month off work. Two years on, the woman said she still has pain from the surgery. Ms Palmer-Hughes said more than half of her clients had undergone surgery in Turkey - with Hungary, Belgium and Spain also regular destinations. She added that the women often signed documentation they do not get to read, with the terms and conditions containing a clause stating that any negative comments made online or on social media will result in a defamation lawsuit.

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45747042,"The warning signs of type-2 diabetes may be detectable 20 years before the disease is diagnosed, researchers say. Elevated fasting blood sugar levels and insulin resistance were seen in people years before they developed pre-diabetes, often a pre-cursor to type-2, a study found. The findings suggest interventions to stop the disease in its tracks should begin far earlier in life, authors say. Another study found type-1 diabetes may be misdiagnosed after the age of 30. The Japanese study, carried out between 2005 and 2016, looked at the  body mass indexes (BMIs), fasting blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity of 27,000 non-diabetics, who were aged between 30 and 50 and were mostly men.  Insulin resistance occurs when cells of the body do not respond properly to the hormone insulin and can lead to a variety of health problems. A higher BMI is a well known risk factor for type-2 diabetes. The study followed participants until they were diagnosed with type-2 diabetes, pre-diabetes - where blood sugar levels are abnormally high - or the end of 2016, whichever came first.   Over the study period, 1,067 new type-2 diabetes cases were diagnosed. Researchers found these people had had increased fasting blood sugar levels and insulin resistance, along with higher BMIs, up to 10 years before diagnosis.  A similar pattern was observed in those who went on to develop pre-diabetes - the same kind of warning signs, albeit to a lesser degree, had been detectable more than a decade before they were diagnosed.  Because most people who develop type-2 diabetes first go through a pre-diabetes stage, researchers say it means the warning signs of the condition may be detectable more than 20 years before an actual diagnosis.    Dr Hiroyuki Sagesaka, from Aizawa Hospital in Matsumoto, Japan, who led the research, said: ""Because trials of prevention in people with pre-diabetes seem to be less successful over long-term follow-up, we may need to intervene much earlier than the pre-diabetes stage to prevent progression to full blown diabetes.   ""A much earlier intervention trail, either drug or lifestyle-related, is warranted.""  Diabetes UK said about a million people in the UK were thought to have type-2 diabetes and not yet know it.  But the charity points out that pre-diabetes does not have to develop into type-2 - people can usually make lifestyle changes to prevent this.  Diabetes UK added: ""Knowing your risk at any point in time is of course helpful in avoiding or preventing a diagnosis of type-2 diabetes.  ""Whether you're at increased risk of type-2 diabetes or not, everyone should be encouraged to live a healthier lifestyle by eating better and moving more."" The research is being presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes conference and published in The Journal of Endocrine Society. Separately, people who develop type-1 diabetes later in life are at risk of being misdiagnosed with the type-2 version of the disease, research suggests. This small study indicated 39% of people diagnosed with type-1 diabetes after the age of 30 were not immediately given insulin. Type-1 diabetics need to be given insulin immediately, while those with type-2 can often treat the condition by improving their diet and exercising more. Dr Nick Thomas, from the University of Exeter, who led the research, said: ""Getting the right diagnosis is important for these patients to receive the right education and treatment.""

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45736465,"You may have seen headlines saying that vitamin D supplements do not improve bone health or prevent fractures and falls, even though official advice says everyone should consider taking them - particularly during autumn and winter.  So what's the truth? Vitamin D supplements have been a topic of hot debate for many years.  Some say they keep bones healthy and help ward off colds and flu, while others argue they are a waste of money. Vitamin D helps to control the amount of calcium and phosphate in our bodies, which is needed for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. Normally it's made when the skin is exposed to sunlight - so we get plenty in spring and summer. But in autumn and winter, when sunlight is scarce, less of the vitamin is made and one in five people in the UK become deficient. Although vitamin D is contained in some food, it's difficult to get the recommended amount this way. That's why, in 2016, health officials said everyone should think about taking a daily vitamin D pill because it would be hard for some people to meet the daily 10 micrograms (400IU) recommended by experts. They said the advice was to protect bone and muscle health. That does not mean everyone has to buy the supplements - just consider whether they might need them. The study behind the headlines is a large meta-analysis of 81 previous trials into vitamin D and bone health, but only four of those trials looked at people who were actually deficient in the vitamin. Healthy people with healthy levels of vitamin D are unlikely to see any benefits. Public Health England responded, saying its advice was still appropriate. Other independent experts were critical too, pointing to the fact that taking supplements only works if you are low on the vitamin in the first place. Prof Adrian Martineau, of Queen Mary University of London, said the findings ""do not provide any reason to revisit or reconsider"" current advice.  And Prof Martin Hewison, from the Society for Endocrinology, said: ""Almost all trials for vitamin D supplementation have shown that supplementation is only effective if you are vitamin D-deficient to begin with.  ""As such, the benefits of vitamin D supplements were difficult to determine from the study, even though it involved a large number of individuals."" The researchers, writing in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, say themselves that ""more research might be needed"".  Deficiency is defined as having levels of vitamin D below 25 nanomoles per litre of blood serum (nmol/L).  Public Health England recommends that a healthy balanced diet and short bursts of sunshine will mean most people get all the vitamin D they need in the spring and summer.",,,,

Christine Welten, who posted on Reddit about how much she appreciated her husband telling her it was OK to wake him up for cuddles, said: ""I actually initially created my post more to highlight my husband's amazing nature, than my battle with PTSD."" But it soon became apparent that she had touched a lot of people also struggling with the disorder, people who were inspired to share their stories.  Her post received more than 25,000 upvotes in 10 days. ""It was humbling for both my husband and I to see the love and community that came out of one simple post,"" she said.  As an author and public speaker on mental health matters, Christine is quite accustomed to starting discussions on social media, but said she found it much harder to speak openly about the issues behind her PTSD. ""Even when it is uncomfortable, I try to be as open as I can,"" she said and praised all those who shared their own experiences of PTSD as ""so brave"". ""It restored my faith in humanity hearing so many people say they want to support and love their partners the best they can."" One comment included advice on getting through a panic attack by counting down and naming five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste.

""Sometimes I panic so much I can't focus to just do it in my head and I'll force myself to mutter it aloud under my breath. I've yet to make it all the way to the end without becoming less anxious."" As the sharing continued, one uploader confessed they had always wondered how to show empathy better to their partner, adding they would ""shamelessly steal"" Christine's husband's idea. Praise poured in for him, with one person calling him a ""keeper"", while others shared their own struggles with PTSD, saying half the battle is simply having someone there. One Reddit user shared the similar tactics used by their boyfriend: ""My boyfriend does something similar. I have terrible OCD and often get into a panic at night and I'll just cuddle up to him and he'll wake up and hold me, never angry. If it's really bad and I'm in tears, he'll sit up and help me through it, get me water etc. It's one of the many reasons I love him."" Christine responded to some of the posts about coping strategies, and particularly loved one from somebody praising their partner's kindness, consideration and compassion which read: ""I never expected anyone to act that way. I've never felt more loved. I love my best friend and team-mate."" The post added that the person's partner gives them a ""pop quiz"" before bed to calm them down.  ""He asks me where he's at, when can I wake him up, and so on. The answers are always in the other room and whenever I need him. It doesn't matter if he's asleep, if I'm having a bad night and need him, just go. ""It is the sweetest thing, and I didn't know people were that considerate and compassionate and loving, or more so.""  Although there were one or two people who questioned whether PTSD is a real condition, Christine said she was taken aback by some of the heartfelt comments: ""To find myself in tears from some of the posts and the overwhelming sense of love I received from the majority of them was hugely cathartic and validating,"" she said.

It emerged on Thursday that the waste from hospitals had not been disposed of in a timely fashion by contractor Healthcare Environmental Services. The Environment Agency said the firm was in breach of permits. HES said it had previously highlighted the need to invest in the UK's ""ageing"" incinerator network for clinical waste. The Department of Health in England said there was no risk to the public. A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency in England said it had found HES to be in breach of environmental permits at five sites which deal with clinical waste. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) also confirmed that it issued enforcement notices at sites in Dundee and Shotts last month, where its officers are conducting ""ongoing monitoring"". A Cobra meeting to discuss the issue was chaired by English Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month, according to the Health Service Journal, which first reported the story.  A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency said: ""We are taking enforcement action against the operator, which includes clearance of the excess waste, and have launched a criminal investigation. ""We are supporting the government and the NHS to ensure there is no disruption to public services and for alternative plans to be put in place for hospitals affected to dispose of their waste safely."" SEPA said it was working closely with the Environment Agency and ""robustly monitoring sites in Scotland"". HES has a transfer station for waste in Dundee and a storage, processing and incineration site at Shotts. SEPA said the company had not gone over its agreed regulatory limits for either of the two Scottish sites.  A UK government spokesman said it was monitoring the situation closely and had made sure that public services - including NHS Trusts - had contingency plans in place.  He added: ""There is absolutely no risk to the health of patients or the wider public. ""Our priority is to prevent disruption to the NHS and other vital public services and work is under way to ensure organisations can continue to dispose of their waste safely and efficiently."" The Scottish government said there had been no reports of any impact on services from NHS boards in Scotland. A spokesman added: ""In the event of any disruption to service at NHS sites across Scotland, NHS Scotland already has contingency plans ready to put into place to ensure there is no impact on services to patients or staff."" Healthcare Environmental Services describes itself on its website as the ""UK's leading independent provider of healthcare waste management"".  Its latest company accounts show it had a turnover of just over ¬£31m in the year to the end of April 2017.  They credited an 18% increase in sales to a new treatment plant in Newcastle.  Company directors Garry and Alison Pettigrew were paid ¬£299,521 between them.  They also shared dividends of ¬£480,000.  The company owns land and buildings worth ¬£3.7m. HES said it had highlighted the reduction in the UK's high-temperature incineration capacity for the last few years to the UK government, NHS bodies and the Environment Agency. The company said all of its waste was stored ""in accordance with strict regulations"".  ""Anatomical waste is not stored on any of our facilities for longer than is allowed by permitted guidelines,"" HES said. A spokesman added:  ""We have welcomed visits from the EA a number of times over the past few months and have pointed out to them that the amount of waste produced by the NHS for incineration far outweighs the entire incineration capabilities of the UK, and not just HES.  ""We are not the only company to feel the strain on our services, with many of our competitors continually breaching storage regulations."" Jonathan Ashworth, Labour's shadow health and social care secretary in England, called on Matt Hancock to make a statement in the House of Commons on the ""staggering revelations"" next week.

""Given the scale of this, it's hugely disappointing that the secretary of state has not done this,"" he added.

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45751016,"Every year more than a million people are victims of domestic abuse in the UK. Often the focus is on helping the victim find safety - but what of the abusers? Should they be given help? And can they change?  Andrew found himself wanting to change when he faced the prospect of losing his family. He had been abusive to his partner, Emma, injuring her a number of times.  After his violence escalated, he moved out and Emma struggled to cope with their children.  They were later removed from their care.   Emma was offered courses to support her as she tried to move on from the abusive relationship and rebuild her self-esteem. However, Andrew was looking for something for himself.  He wanted to stop abusing his partner and sought help. He found Phoenix Domestic Abuse Service, which offered a weekly programme to help men confront their actions and change their behaviour.  Andrew remembers his first time at Phoenix, walking into a room full of ""big blokes, mean looking blokes"" and thinking ""Oh, what have I done?"" But after seven months on the course he has formed a bond with the group and says he is beginning to understand the effects of his behaviour.  Every week he was challenged on his behaviour and had to confront his actions.  The course uses role-play, problem-solving tasks, and challenging discussions to teach the men about the impact of their actions.  ""I'm not proud of who I was then, but I am proud of who I am now,"" he says.  Emma says she recognises the transformation in Andrew. ""He's different. We talk more, he listens,"" she says.  They were separated for two years but are now together again and are working to get their children back. Lidia, who helped Andrew through the course, said it is important to intervene because ""if no one does any work with that person then they are likely to go on and find another victim.  ""Their next relationship is likely to become abusive."" Phoenix sees both sides of abusive relationships on a weekly basis, believing the abuser and the abused partner both need support - either together or apart - if they hope to break out of the violent cycle.  But not everyone has such positive experiences of domestic abuse courses.  Sarah - not her real name - did not see any change in her partner when he was referred to a programme by her local authority.  ""If anything it made him angrier,"" she says. The abuse continued, both throughout and after the course.  ""[It was] seriously bad violence,"" she says. ""Strangling you, picking you up by your hair, throwing you across rooms, smashing your head into walls.""  She thinks the courses are not enough to make meaningful change and abusers will only reform with years of therapy. ""Their whole brain needs unpicking. It's got to be long-term mental health intervention, not a six-week course, because they are so manipulative they will pull the wool over people's eyes."" She says she feels let down by the system. She has not been offered any significant support to protect her from her abusive partner, she says, adding that he knows where she lives and continues to harass her and her children.  She doesn't feel the perpetrator programme held her abuser to account. It is estimated that every year more than 3,000 people in the UK attend such courses - and that number is growing each year. Cafcass, the Family Courts Support Service, made 800 referrals last year, four times as many as five years ago.  The vast majority of those who attend are men.  Costs start at around ¬£500, with that figure being picked up by either local authorities or individuals.  Some courses target the perpetrator alone, while others run parallel courses for their partners. However, the debate rages as to which approach works best.   Dr Gene Feder is conducting the first clinical trial of a perpetrator course.  ""If you ignore perpetrators you're really ignoring the upstream origin of the problem,"" he says. ""If you just respond to survivors you're in some ways colluding in the repeated cycle of violence which goes on."" Rachel Williams is a survivor of domestic abuse, she was with her husband for 18 years and the abuse she suffered escalated over time. When they separated he came to the salon where she worked with a sawn off shotgun and shot her in the leg at point blank range.  Rachel is now an advocate for survivors and hears from lots of women seeking support. She has heard of abusers using the courses in court to claim they have changed, despite continuing to abuse and manipulate their partners and even blaming their partners for having to go on a course.  She thinks people do not understand the true effect of domestic violence and how clever and manipulative abusers can be. ""We need to keep monitoring them. The only people who can tell if they have changed is their new partner."" Denise has been running a perpetrator course for more than 20 years. She says those who want to change should be given the opportunity to do so. ""There are going to be some people out there who cannot change and will not change, for a variety of reasons. ""But those that want to, those that are willing to give it a go, they need to be given the opportunity and I think for those people, yes they can change.""

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45761546,"Post-traumatic stress disorder of serving Army personnel and military veterans has increased in the last 10 years, a new study suggests. Most sufferers were veterans who saw active combat; 17% reported symptoms of probable PTSD.  Experts said the delayed onset of the illness, and the loss of support when leaving the army, were probable causes.  And more veterans are seeking treatment, as awareness of PTSD has increased.  The study of nearly 9,000 of the military, by King's College London, is published in the British Journal of Psychiatry. It shows that PTSD in the military increased from 4% in 2004-5 to 6% in 2014-16.  Among veterans deployed in a combat role to Iraq or Afghanistan, 17% reported symptoms suggesting probable PTSD, compared to 6% deployed in support roles such as doctors and aircrew.  Lead author Dr Sharon Stevelink, from the Institute of Psychology, Psychiatry & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King's College, said: ""For the first time we have identified that the risk of PTSD for veterans deployed in conflicts was substantially higher than the risk for those still serving.  ""While the increase among veterans is a concern, not every veteran has been deployed and in general only about one in three would have been in a combat role."" The findings are from the third phase of a major study which has been running since 2003.  The latest phase of the study surveyed participants between 2014 and 2016. 62% of them had deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, and the average age was 40.   The study also found that common mental health disorders - like anxiety and depression - had remained largely static at 22%.  Alcohol misuse remained a common problem, but fell from 15% to 10%.   Explaining the high figures among veterans, Prof Nicola Fear from the IoPPN, pointed out that people with mental health issues are more likely to leave the Army. The act of leaving, with the corresponding loss of social support, can also trigger conditions.   ""We know that individuals who experience mental health issues are more likely to leave the armed forces.  ""We also know that the transition of leaving the armed forces can introduce stresses. You may need to find somewhere to live, you may need to find a job.""  There is also far greater awareness of PTSD and mental health issues generally, popularised by dramas like BBC TV's Bodyguard, and many veterans feel more comfortable talking about their condition.  PTSD affects between 4-5% of the UK population, with the highest rate of 12% among women between 16-24 years old. Victims of sexual assault have the highest rates of PTSD.  Source: Royal College of Psychiatrists Prof Simon Wessely, Regius Professor of Psychiatry at King's College London, pointed out that treatments have improved and there's less stigma attached.  ""It used to take people maybe 10-13 years to come forward for treatment, now that's down to around 2-3 years,"" he said.  ""There's been a huge investment in treatment, with many more services available. ""When people leave they can lose the social network that the Army provides. Support from family and friends can be crucial.""  Professor Wendy Burn, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""It is vital that we meet the growing demand for military and veteran mental health services so that those who serve their country can easily access care."" Dr Walter Busuttil, medical director at the charity Combat Stress, said more and more veterans were asking for support. ""In the last decade, the number of veterans seeking help from our charity, particularly from those who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, has increased by 97% with more than 2,000 new veterans now coming to us each year.""

Emma Mhic Mhath√∫na was one of the most public figures in the 'CervicalCheck' national screening programme crisis. She was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016 after receiving two incorrect smear test results.  Ms Mhic Mhath√∫na was one of 221 cervical cancer patients who may have benefitted from earlier treatment, according to a clinical audit. The 37-year-old from County Kerry, who was a mother-of-five, was told her cancer was terminal in May this year. She settled her case against the Health Service Executive (HSE) and US laboratory Quest Diagnostics for ‚Ç¨7.5m (¬£6.5m). Quest admitted to misreading two cervical smear slides in 2010 and 2013. The HSE admitted liability for not disclosing the findings of the CervicalCheck audit. Along with others, Ms Mhic Mhath√∫na campaigned over the CervicalCheck crisis for openness. She was on some trial treatments, but her cancer spread. Ms Mhic Mhath√∫na wanted all of her settlement paid into court for the benefit of her five children.

The court found gynaecologist Eduardo Vela, 85, had committed the crimes but could not legally be convicted because too much time had elapsed.  He was the first person to go on trial for illegal adoptions that took place during and after the fascist dictatorship of General Franco. Thousands more cases are suspected. After Franco's triumph in Spain's 1936-1939 civil war, many children were removed from families identified by the fascist regime as left-wing and given to families considered more deserving. In√©s Madrigal was abducted and illegally adopted as a baby in 1969. She took a case against Vela in April 2012.  Her adoptive mother, In√©s P√©rez, said before her death that Vela had given her the baby as ""a gift"", because she and her husband could not have children. DNA testing has shown that Ms Madrigal is not related to her late parents. However, because Ms Madrigal failed to take the case for 25 years after she first became an adult - in 1987 - it fell foul of the statute of limitations, which is 10 years.  When the case first reached the court, it ruled that a decision would be taken as to whether the timeline fell outside the statute of limitations as part of the verdict.  Ms Madrigal was in court for the verdict but Vela was absent.  She and her lawyer say she will appeal to the Supreme Court so the doctor's crimes do not remain unpunished. Prosecutors had sought an 11-year jail term for Vela.  The Madrid provincial court found he had committed three crimes - abduction, fraud over pregnancy and forgery of documents. By Bruno Boelpaep, BBC News, outside the court Ms Madrigal entered the court with her lawyer and came out an hour later with mixed feelings. ""I'm happy because it's been proven that I was stolen, Dr Vela stole me,"" she said. But she was also disappointed that the doctor was now free: ""It's a little hard to take that there would be a limitation on this crime."" She thanked and hugged her supporters, a handful of women also looking for missing children. One was Cristina, who gave birth in Madrid 1984: ""We are really disappointed - it's like being slapped in the face. We need to change the laws so there would be no statute of limitations for these crimes."" Spain's stolen babies scandal went on for decades, from Franco's early years in power to the 1990s. It took a long time to surface because the Roman Catholic Church and medical profession are highly respected, and Spanish law did not require the biological mother's name on the birth certificate. The scandal is closely linked to the Church, which under Franco assumed a prominent role in Spain's social services including hospitals, schools and children's homes. Nuns and priests compiled waiting lists of would-be adoptive parents, while doctors are said to have lied to mothers about the fate of their children. Democracy is well established now but the Franco era still haunts Spain. There was an unwritten ""pact of forgetting"" during the democratic transition in the late 1970s. An amnesty law adopted in 1977, aimed at smoothing the transition to democracy, made it difficult to look into baby trafficking as courts and politicians refused to investigate it.  UPDATE 12 July 2019: It emerged that In√©s Madrigal had not been stolen but had been given up for adoption voluntarily by her biological mother. Prosecutors decided that the court's decision that Eduardo Vela had committed crimes should no longer be considered valid.",,,,

The Take That singer and his wife Dawn lost Poppy when she was delivered stillborn in 2012. Barlow wrote about the pain of losing his daughter in his autobiography, A Better Me. The singer said he was initially unsure about whether to include the chapter and had to get his wife to help him write it accurately. Barlow said he had to re-write it three times.  ""The first time was very inaccurate in the way I remembered it, so I sat and wrote the last version with Dawn,"" he told an audience at the Cheltenham Literature Festival. The former X Factor judge added that what made him include such a painful experience was ""how it will actually help other people"".  ""There is one thing about this, it's that it's not really been talked about much. ""People say things like, 'You've got three other kids' and people don't really understand your pain, it makes it more painful. ""For us it was the chance to help all the other people who are not understood either. It just felt like the right thing to do and the right thing to be in this book,"" he explained. ""All the comments I have ever had, everyone has been unbelievably supportive and I really thank everybody for that."" Barlow recounted the moment he was told Poppy had died, calling it ""one of those unbelievably strange days"". ""Dawn had not been feeling well, she had shot off back to London and we were two days off the due date,"" he said. ""I got a phone call and Dawn said, 'I can't think of any other way of saying this but the baby has died'."" He described to the audience the ""strange day"" when he held his daughter and got to have a few moments with her.  ""I was just dreading this thing happening and when she did give birth, it was amazing. We had the most incredible hour with our daughter. ""It was like a light coming into the room. It was gorgeous, both holding her, taking photographs and footprints, it was the most gorgeous hour. ""We had our moment and we were kind of happy with it and then we went home to a very empty house. Then we started organising the funeral because these things need organising."" Barlow married Dawn in 2000 and the couple have three other children; Daniel, Emily and Daisy. He said that he doesn't think there will ever come a time when he is over the feeling of losing a child.  ""At that point I wasn't even starting to grieve, really, because I wanted to take care of her (Dawn) because we had three other kids,"" Barlow said. ""We all just looked after Dawn. We tried to be there for her. It is something I don't think we will ever recover from, especially her."" The Tommy's charity says 1 in every 225 births ends in a stillbirth in the UK.

The child contracted the herpes simplex virus at Watford General hospital, which led to a brain fever.  His barrister, Henry Witcomb QC, told London's High Court the virus ""was not detected and acted upon"" soon enough. West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust had previously apologised and agreed to settle his case. The boy's solicitor said the payout was the ""highest award ever"" in a clinical negligence case against the NHS. The court heard there was a two-day delay in giving the boy an antiviral drug. It resulted in ""catastrophic damage to his brain"" which caused eyesight and communication problems, cognitive and movement difficulties as well as behavioural issues. ""The effects of the negligence have been tragic both for the boy and his family,"" Mrs Justice Lambert said. She told the court the Trust admitted liability for what happened to the boy at an early stage and had agreed to settle his case. The boy will receive a lump sum payout, plus annual, index linked and tax free payments to cover the costs of the 24-hour care he will need for life. Mr Witcomb said the value of the settlement, calculated over the boy's lifetime, comes to more than ¬£37m.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says non-surgical options, like pelvic muscle exercises, are the first to turn to.  The NHS in England has already put restrictions on mesh operations after safety concerns.  Many women say the implants cause agony by cutting into tissue. It is estimated that more than 100,000 UK women have had a mesh fitted. The net-like fabric can be attached into the wall of the vagina to act as a scaffold to support organs, such as the bladder, to keep them in the right place to help manage incontinence or another condition called prolapse. Mesh operations have not been banned altogether during the NHS ""pause"" - carefully selected patients continue to have access in discussion with their consultant. The new guidelines for England make it clear that any woman considering having the surgery for incontinence or prolapse should be fully aware of the possible risks:  Patients and doctors should report any complications associated with the implants to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Details of the complications should be logged in a national registry. Sir Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE, said: ""Where surgical mesh/tape could be an option, there is almost always another intervention recommended in our guideline, which does not involve surgical mesh/tape. If a surgeon cannot provide a full range of choices to the patient, then she should be referred to one who can."" The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and The British Society of Urogynaecology both welcomed the NICE guidelines.  But Kath Sansom, from the campaign group Sling The Mesh, said the guidelines did not go far enough. ""Our ideal scenario is to see pelvic mesh stopped. Full stop. The risks are too great. It is totally unacceptable that women come out of a 'simple little operation' with shattered lives.""",,,,

Health Minister Stephen Barclay said new arrangements have been made to replace the service by Healthcare Environmental Services (HES).  HES says although it did also collect some body parts, this anatomical waste was correctly stored as per guidelines. It removed waste from a number of hospitals in England and Scotland. The Environment Agency first raised the alarm about the problem at the end of July, the government said.  The government says there was ""absolutely no risk"" posed to the health of patients or the wider public. In a statement to Parliament, Mr Barclay said NHS Improvement concluded that HES ""failed to demonstrate that they were operating within their contractual limits. ""Consequently, 15 NHS Trusts served termination notices to HES formally to terminate their contracts at 4pm on Sunday,"" he said. New arrangements have been made with Mitie to ""step in and replace this service"" and ""NHS services continue to operate as normal"", Mr Barclay told MPs. Mr Barclay said the primary concern was that too much waste was being held in a number of waste storage and treatment sites by HES. ""While the waste was stored securely, it was not being processed and disposed of within the correct regulatory timescales. At no point has there been an impact on public health or any delay to the ability of the NHS to carry out operations,"" he said. The Environment Agency said HES was in breach of its environmental permits at four of its six sites which deal with clinical waste - by having more waste on site than their permit allows and storing waste inappropriately. The EA has launched a criminal investigation.  HES said it had highlighted a reduction in the UK's high-temperature incineration capacity for the last few years to the UK government, NHS bodies and the Environment Agency. Mr Barclay insisted there was ""significant"" additional incineration capacity. The waste disposal firm is to retain its NHS contracts in Scotland despite being stripped of them in England and Wales.

NHS chief Simon Stevens will today thank former BBC Breakfast presenter Bill Turnbull and broadcaster Stephen Fry for the work they have done in urging men to come forward for help.  Both had treatment earlier this year.  Mr Stevens said they were ""owed a debt of gratitude."" Latest figures show that from April to July 2018, 14,479 patients received treatment for a urological cancer - an increase of 3,929 (36%) compared to the same period in 2017. And there were 70,000 visits to the NHS website advice page on prostate cancer in March, a 250% increase from the monthly average of around 20,000. Mr Stevens said there would be ¬£10m of additional investment for hospitals to increase their capacity to treat more patients with the disease.  ""This additional investment will help ensure the NHS can manage this jump in demand, so that all people with suspected cancer are tested and treated quickly,"" he said.  The jump in demand also coincided with media coverage about the number of people dying from prostate cancer overtaking deaths from breast cancer.

There is currently no treatment for the rare but lethal brain disease, known as the human version of ""mad cow disease"". Doctors in London were given permission for the trial use on a human for the first time by the Court of Protection.  Scientists say lab testing of the man-made antibody has been encouraging, but they admit they do not know how their patient will respond. The patient in this case, who has not been named, has sporadic CJD, the most common form of the disease in humans.  This is different from variant CJD, the version linked to eating beef infected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE. Sporadic CJD happens when healthy proteins in the human body - prions - become spontaneously misshapen and build up in the brain.  The man-made antibody treatment, called PRN100, aims to prevent abnormal prions from being able to attach themselves to healthy proteins, meaning that they cannot grow and cause devastation throughout the brain. University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) is set to use it in a patient for the first time after a judge from the Court of Protection confirmed on Monday that it was lawful and in the patient's best interests to receive it. Prof John Collinge, director of the Medical Research Council Prion Unit at University College London, who led the development of the treatment, said: ""As this is the first time this treatment has been used in humans we cannot predict what the outcome will be, but laboratory testing has shown the potential to treat prion infection.  ""A key issue will be whether a sufficient quantity of the drug is able to cross the blood brain barrier to reach the brain tissue where it needs to work. ""We will proceed with extreme caution in very tightly-controlled conditions.  ""A team of experts from a range of disciplines will make collective decisions in the best interests of the patient."" Colin Beatty's wife, Annie, died in 2010 after she was diagnosed with sporadic CJD.  Annie was 70 and the couple had been married for 40 years. ""The diagnosis was devastating. It was like a bomb had gone off in our family,"" said Colin. Colin, 75, from Dorset, said the illness made Annie vacant in the beginning.  Then her speech became muddled and she would wander off without warning, which he said was ""terrifying"". ""It was heartbreaking to watch Annie deteriorate. ""I nursed her at home initially but she became very difficult to care for, so we had to admit her to a nursing home."" Colin said if the PRN100 antibody had been available at the time, he would have wanted Annie to have had the opportunity to be treated with it. ""It's true that the treatment carries potential risks, and the benefits are not yet certain, but without it, there is no hope. The only certainty with CJD is death."" UCLH's National Prion Clinic sees about 120 patients with sporadic CJD each year. The patient, who together with his family supported the UCLH's court application, will initially receive the treatment via a drip into a vein in the arm.  The hospital trust said it was preparing for a range of possible outcomes, from the treatment having no measurable effect to slowing or halting the progression of the disease.  It is not expected to reverse any brain damage that has already occurred. UCLH said it would see how the first patient responded before considering using it in a second person.  UCLH's chief executive, Prof Marcel Levi, said: ""At present, caring for patients with CJD involves trying to use medicines to alleviate symptoms only, but sadly the disease always results in the rapid death of the patient.

Mesh implants are at the centre of health scandal affecting women around the world, prompting lawsuits in the UK, US, Canada and Australia. In March, an Australian inquiry found that the devices had ruined many lives. The medical implants were used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence after childbirth. More than 700 women in Australia have joined a class action against one manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, but lawyers say up to 8,000 women may have been affected. Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Wednesday: ""On behalf of the Australian government, I say sorry to all of those women with the historic agony and pain that has come from mesh implantation which have led to horrific outcomes. ""This has been an issue, over some decades in many cases, and on our time and our watch."" The Senate inquiry estimated that about 150,000 women in Australia were fitted with mesh implants in the past two decades, in many cases to help treat complications post-childbirth. The net-like fabric can be attached into the wall of the vagina to act as a scaffold to support organs, such as the bladder, to keep them in the right place to help manage incontinence or prolapse. Negative effects reported after surgery have included bleeding, nerve and tissue damage, perforated organs and mesh eroding into the vagina. The inquiry found that many women had suffered chronic and debilitating pain, leaving a ""devastating impact"" on their lives, relationships and careers. It also noted that those suffering had often struggled to have their condition identified or for their pain to be taken seriously by doctors - worsening distress.

Theresa May said the appointment of Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price to the new role will help tackle the stigma surrounding suicide. While suicide rates are falling, 4,500 people take their own lives every year. The appointment comes as ministers and officials from more than 50 countries assemble in London for the summit. Wednesday's meeting - hosted by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and attended by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - coincides with World Mental Health Day. The government has also promised more support in schools, bringing in new mental health support teams and offering help in measuring students' health, including their mental wellbeing. Ms May said: ""We can end the stigma that has forced too many to suffer in silence and prevent the tragedy of suicide taking too many lives."" Alongside the announcement, the prime minister pledged ¬£1.8m to the Samaritans so the charity can continue providing its free helpline for the next four years. If you, or someone you know, is struggling, there are a number of charities here to help.  Hannah Lewis - who campaigns for improvements to mental health services having suffered from panic attacks, anxiety and suicidal thoughts as a teenager - said that it can be a year before someone who is referred for help actually begins treatment.   She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Mental health is known to deteriorate when you are left without help, and you can only imagine how things got worse with me."" Ms Lewis welcomed the government's announcement - especially the proposals to bring more awareness of mental health into schools - but she added: ""More joined-up working at schools and early intervention is great, but we need to make sure then there are sufficient services to be signposted to.""  Mrs Doyle-Price, who has been an MP since 2010, will now become the minister for mental health, inequalities and suicide prevention. As health is devolved separately to the UK's four nations, her role will include making sure each local area in England has effective plans to stop unnecessary deaths and to look into how technology could help identify those at risk. She said she understood the ""tragic, devastating and long-lasting"" effect of suicide on families, having met some of those bereaved.  ""It's these people who need to be at the heart of what we do,"" she added.  Manchester University's Prof Louis Appleby, one of the country's leading experts on suicide, said having a minister for suicide prevention would ""open doors"" and make it easier to have conversations about the role such things as benefits and online gambling have in suicidal people's lives. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the appointment would also help with getting support for mental illness on a par with services for physical health.   ""There is a long road to travel to get there.

This means eating mainly plant-based foods, and is one of three key steps towards a sustainable future for all in 2050, they say. Food waste will need to be halved and farming practices will also have to improve, according to the study. Without action, the impacts of the food system could increase by up to 90%. Fast on the heels of the landmark report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) comes this new study on how food production and consumption impact major threats to the planet. The authors say that the food system has a number of significant environmental impacts including being a major driver of climate change, depleting freshwater and pollution through excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorous.  The study says that thanks to the population and income growth expected between 2010 and 2050, these impacts could grow between 50-90%. This could push our world beyond its planetary boundaries, which the authors say represent a ""safe operating space for humanity on a stable Earth system"". However the study finds that no single solution will avert the dangers, so a combined approach is needed.  So when it comes to climate change, the authors looked at what they called a ""flexitarian diet"". ""We can eat a range of healthy diets but what they all have in common, according to the latest scientific evidence, is that they are all relatively plant based,"" said lead author Dr Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford.  ""You can go from a diet that has small amounts of animal products, some might call it a Mediterranean based diet, we call it a flexitarian diet, over to a pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan diet - we tried to stay with the most conservative one of these which in our view is the flexitarian one, but even this has only one serving of red meat per week."" If the world moved to this type of diet, the study found that greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be reduced by more than half.   But as well as altering diets, the research says that farming practices need to change significantly. This involves boosting yields from existing cropland, improving water management and restricting and recycling fertiliser use.  ""We looked at improving agricultural yields in particular of more health sensitive crops like fruit, vegetables and legumes,"" said Dr Springmann. ""In the past there has been lots of invest in the stable grains like maize and corn, but now we really need to move it to the crops we need more of. We also looked at increasing the efficiency of water use, and we looked at better monitoring and recycling of fertiliser - lots of it is lost and it runs off into rivers and causes dead zones in the oceans."" In addition, the study found that halving the amount of food lost to waste would reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture by 16%. ""Tackling food loss and waste will require measures across the entire food chain, from storage, and transport, over food packaging and labelling to changes in legislation and business behaviour that promote zero-waste supply chains,"" said Fabrice de Clerck, director of science at EAT who funded the study. The key element is that these three solutions must be implemented together. ""Feeding a world population of 10 billion people is possible - yet only if we change the way we eat, and the way we produce food,"" said Johan Rockstr√∂m, director designate of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who is one of the authors of the study. ""All measures combined can result in keeping healthy both planet and people."" The study has been published in the journal Nature.",,,,

So is there a way we can get the benefits without the huffing and puffing? Tai chi may offer one solution.  It originated as a form of self-defence, but over hundreds of years, it's been refined into a series of slow and graceful movements which are supposed to help both mind and body.  But can something so slow and graceful really give you the benefits of a more vigorous workout? To find out, the Trust Me I'm a Doctor team worked with exercise scientists from the University of Birmingham. A small group of volunteers, aged between 65 and 75, none of whom did regular exercise, were assigned to either 12 weeks of regular sessions of  Zumba Gold - a class specially tailored for people in later life - with the rest doing regular tai chi.  At the beginning, middle and end of the 12 weeks, the volunteers had their blood pressure checked and the flexibility of their blood vessels measured using ultrasound - part of exercise's power to improve your health lies in its ability to improve both of these.      The more flexible your blood vessels, the healthier they are.  More from the Trust Me I'm a Doctor team Scientists also measured the volunteers' blood for levels of antioxidants and other raised levels of chemical markers of stress and inflammation - which may sound bad, but they're actually a healthy response to exercise and lie behind many of its benefits.  As might be expected, the Zumba Gold group were all fitter after the 12 weeks. Their blood vessels were more elastic and their blood pressure had dropped, while their blood results showed improvements too. More surprisingly, the results from the tai chi group showed similar benefits, with improvements in blood biomarkers results, blood pressure and vessel flexibility.  So how could tai chi be doing this? The answer may be deceptively simple. Tai chi may look slow and graceful, but it's not as gentle as it seems.  Dr Jet Veldhuijzen van Zanten, a senior lecturer in biological psychology and part of the research team, said: ""We have found that doing a session of tai chi leads to similar increases in heart rate as moderate intensity exercise.   ""So even though it might not feel as difficult as when you are doing faster movements, your heart is working hard.  ""This will have benefits to the health of your blood vessels and make them more elastic.""   And she said it showed people shouldn't be put off if they didn't feel like they were up to more strenuous forms of exercise. ""We have shown a tai chi programme which includes slow movements can have many health benefits, and the participants in our study enjoyed the programme.  ""It is really important to emphasise that any amount and any kind of exercise is good for your health and wellbeing.""

Pharmacies and supermarkets are full of cough and cold medicines which claim to relieve symptoms of the common cold. But there is little evidence that many of them work, according to a BMJ review of trials on over-the-counter treatments. And some, like decongestants, are not suitable for babies, children or pregnant women. The common cold can cause a sore throat, cough, congestion, a raised temperature and sneezing - all irritating symptoms - but after a week or so they should go away on their own. The truth is there is no magic cure. Dr Rahul Chodhari, consultant paediatrician and spokesman for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, says parents should try using saline nasal washes, also called nasal irrigation.  They can be bought over the counter in the form of drops or sprays. The saltwater solution helps to clear the mucus from the nose and reduces the feeling of congestion. ""There are no side effects, it can be used many times a day and it's well proven to reduce swelling around the nose,"" Dr Chodhari says. Apart from that, paracetamol in the form of Calpol, is useful for treating a fever - but it doesn't help relieve a blocked nose. Decongestants are not suitable for children under 12, according to the NHS, because of the risk of side effects, like drowsiness and stomach upsets.  Adults can use them for a maximum of three to seven days, but the BMJ research says they have ""a small effect on nasal symptoms"". They can help ease blocked or stuffy noses by reducing the swelling or the blood vessels in the nose, which helps open up the airways. However, they also increase the risk of headaches and insomnia, among other side effects, and using them for too long can lead to chronic nasal congestion. Dr Chodhari says cough syrups are not recommended because they stop children coughing up mucus and getting rid of it. And antibiotics only work against bacterial infections and so they do nothing to combat colds. Vapour rubs and steam inhalation are not advised either, he says. Research on whether these kind of remedies work is really lacking. The following ones have not been studied in children, or aren't effective, the BMJ research says: According to NHS UK, there is little evidence that supplements such as vitamin C, zinc or garlic prevent colds or speed up recovery. Make an appointment to see your GP: Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and keep warm to help see off a cold. The common cold is usually caused by viruses which are spread easily between people, especially small ones - particularly from coughs and sneezes. So you can avoid catching a cold by washing your hands regularly in warm water and soap and not touching your eyes or nose in case you have come into contact with the virus.

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45819203,"New research suggests that standing desks, which allow employees to alter their position during the day, may boost performance at work. A number of NHS staff were given new desks and set goals for standing time. After a year, researchers found sitting time was reduced by more than an hour a day compared with their colleagues. Employees who reduced time sitting, by using desks that also allowed them to work while on their feet, also said they were less tired and more engaged. The research team, led by Loughborough University and experts from Leicester, assessed 146 mainly sedentary NHS staff. Seventy-seven were put in an intervention group and given height-adjustable workstations - also known as sit-stand desks - while the remaining 69 continued with their standard desks.  Working time spent sitting was measured at the start of the study and again three, six and 12 months later. At the start of the study, overall sitting time was 9.7 hours per day. Over the course of the experiment, sitting time was lower by 50.62 minutes per day at three months, 64.4 minutes per day at six months, and 82.39 minutes per day at 12 months. Those who were given sit-stand desks also reported improvements in musculoskeletal problems, according to the research published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ). A questionnaire filled out by the participants also suggested employees who used the sit-stand desks were less anxious and cited an improved quality of life - but no notable changes were found for job satisfaction, cognitive function or sickness absence. Medical research has suggested constant sitting is harming our health - potentially causing cardiovascular problems or vulnerability to diabetes. A survey by the British Heart Foundation in 2015 found that the average person sat for almost all of the nine hours spent in the office. But it's not the case everywhere. In Sweden, sit-stand working is commonplace - and in 2014, Denmark made it mandatory for employers to offer their staff sit-stand desks. However, the authors of the report say more research is needed to gauge the longer-term benefits.",,,,

It took a substantial feat of genetic engineering to break the rules of reproduction.  The scientists said the ""bimaternal"" (two mammas) animals were healthy and went on to have pups of their own.  But there was bad news on the all-male front. Mice with double-dads were attempted, but died within days of being born.  The researchers were trying to answer fundamental questions about why we have sex. Mammals, including us, can make babies only through sexual reproduction - aka you need an egg from mum and a sperm from dad. But the rest of the natural world doesn't play by the same rules; some female fish, reptiles, amphibians and birds can go it alone. Welcome to the bizarre world of virgin births known officially as parthenogenesis. The aim of the Chinese researchers was to work out which rules of reproduction they needed to break to make baby mice from same-sex parents. That in turn helps understand why the rules are so important.   ""It's an interesting paper... they're trying to work out what you would have to do to turn us into turkeys,"" said Prof Robin Lovell-Badge at the Francis Crick Institute.  (Yes, your Christmas dinner can reproduce without having sex too.)  In short, with a lot of cutting-edge science. It was easier with double mums. The researchers took an egg from one mouse and a special type of cell - a haploid embryonic stem cell - from another. Both contained only half the required genetic instructions or DNA, but just bringing them together wasn't enough. The researchers had to use a technology called gene editing to delete three sets of genetic instructions to make them compatible (more on that later).  The double-dad approach was slightly more complicated. It took a sperm, a male haploid embryonic stem cell, an egg that had all of its own genetic information removed and the deletion of seven genes to make it all work.  The reason we need to have sex is because our DNA - our genetic code - behaves differently depending on whether it comes from mum or dad, the study in Cell Stem Cell suggests.  And without a female copy and a male copy our whole development gets thrown out of whack.  It's called genomic imprinting with parts of the DNA in sperm and parts of the DNA in eggs getting different ""stamps"" that alter how they work. Errors in genomic imprinting have been implicated in some diseases such as Angelman syndrome.  The bits of DNA carrying these stamps were the ones the researchers had to delete in order to make the baby mice viable.  Dr Wei Li, who conducted the experiments, said: ""This research shows us what's possible. ""We saw that the defects in bimaternal mice can be eliminated and that bipaternal reproduction barriers in mammals can also be crossed."" Unless you're a mouse reading this, and a female one at that, then the answer is not any time soon. Dr Teresa Holm, from the University of Auckland, thinks there is a chance in the long run.  ""[The research] may even lead to the development of ways for same-sex couples to reproduce healthy children of their own,"" she says. But she points out there are ""significant ethical and safety concerns that would need to be overcome"". It would not be allowed to happen until scientists could be sure any resultant children would grow up mentally and physically normal. Some people have doubts that the mice were completely OK. Dr Lovell-Badge told the BBC: ""Even with two mothers I'm not convinced they're normal and the success rate is pretty low. ""It is not something I'd hope anyone would contemplate."" So is sex about to disappear? ""Not yet, no,"" he says. Follow James on Twitter.",,,,

Payton Summons suffered cardiac arrest late last month but her parents obtained a court order forcing a hospital to keep her alive. However, the district court judge said the burden of proof for a further order had not been met, US media report. The current order is due to expire on Monday, the family's lawyer said. Payton ""suffered a devastating injury to her brain due to being without oxygen for over an hour"" as a result of a tumour in her chest that had stopped her blood circulation, doctors at the Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth said in a statement, quoted by local channel KTVT. Payton's parents had not yet decided whether to apply for a new restraining order, lawyer Justin Moore told CNN. ""This presents a great issue for parents in the state of Texas,"" he said.  ""They don't know how to proceed when they have a child put in this condition as Payton Summons has been put in.

She was taken to Cook Children's Medical Center, where doctors said they were able to revive her heartbeat but not her breathing. She was placed on a ventilator before doctors confirmed that she did not have brain activity. Under Texas law, a person is considered dead when they have lost all brain function, the hospital added. Payton's parents filed a temporary restraining order to keep her on life support while they tried to find another hospital that would accept her.

Mothers who started earlier than their peers had sons who had: ‚Ä¢ armpit hair two and a half months earlier ‚Ä¢ acne and voices breaking two months earlier. Their daughters, meanwhile, developed breasts six months earlier. The study, in the Human Reproduction journal, analysed data from nearly 16,000 Danish mothers and children. One of the authors, Dr Nis Brix, of Aarhus University, Denmark, said: ""Whenever a doctor meets a patient with delayed or early onset of puberty, the doctor obtains a family history.  ""The relationship between the mother's pubertal age and the son's pubertal age has been taken as common knowledge but now our data from a large study confirms it."" The age boys and girls start puberty has been gradually decreasing around the world.  In the UK, it is currently starting about one month earlier every decade. And the current average age is: Experts put this down to improved health and nutrition in the industrialised world - but studies have also shown a link between obesity and the early onset of puberty.  In 2015, a study indicated early or late onset of puberty were linked to a increased risk of: In girls, an early puberty was defined as starting between eight and 11, while a late puberty started between 15 and 19. In boys, a normal puberty started between nine and 14. An American study in January suggested early puberty in girls was also linked to increased likelihood of mental health problems during adolescence and into adulthood.  ""Both genetic and environmental factors undoubtedly influence puberty timing,"" said Dr Christine Wohlfahrt-Veje, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen and one of the lead authors on a study in 2016 looking at puberty and timing.  ""Boys and girls inherit from both mothers and fathers - but early pubertal markers, onset of breasts and pubic hair, in girls are less dependent on genetic and hence more on environmental factors such as childhood growth patterns and possibly other environmental exposures.""",,,,

Now in her late 20s, she's been discovering that those years of starvation have left a lasting imprint on her body. ""You have osteoporosis in your spine and osteopenia in your hip. I'm going to put you on calcium and vitamin D and I think you should take them forever. We need to prevent breaks and fractures."" It is May 2018, and my doctor's words jolt me out of a long-standing state of denial. They come with a set of complicated graphs, which apparently show my low bone density. I don't understand them. But I can read the words printed next to a fuzzy X-ray-like picture of my spine: ""World Health Organization classification: osteoporosis. Fracture risk: high."" For years, I have muddled along, pretending to myself that I had pretty much made a full recovery from anorexia. Yes, I was told back in 2010 that I had osteoporosis. But over the next eight years I persuaded myself that things must have improved, that the holes in my spine must have healed.  Sadly, they haven't. Source: National Osteoporosis Society I was first diagnosed with anorexia at the age of 12, and soon experienced its unglamorous consequences. As summers grew hotter, I shivered: I was like a reptile, unable to generate my own body heat. In winter, my skin cracked and bled, but would not heal, for want of nutrition. I had constipation, bloating and my hair fell out in great clumps. My life revolved around avoiding food. Over the past 15 years, I have had two in-patient stints in hospital and taken thousands of antidepressants - anorexia is often accompanied by a low mood, sometimes even a suicidal mood, which is one reason it has the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric disorders.  I have seen more doctors than I can be bothered to remember. I have done my best to keep what my mother calls the ""anorexic minx"" in my mind in check, preventing it from doing a Jack-in-the-Box-style bounce back into my life. The desire to get on with things has spurred me to give up many of my anorexic behaviour patterns. Time was, I would spend hours weighing out salad components in the kitchen, using a different knife to chop each tomato, cucumber and lettuce leaf. I no longer want to waste time on my old routines. And, mostly, I do not. But anorexia has caused my body to age rapidly, and I am now struggling with the disorder's longer-term consequences.  Osteoporosis involves loss of bone density, and in later life may lead to painful breakages, curvature of the spine, and loss of height. Although it has many causes and often affects post-menopausal women, anorexics are also at risk, especially girls who develop the illness at puberty when the body is trying to build a strong skeleton. For a day or so, the bone scans shake me awake. I walk around the Lebanese capital Beirut, where I live, feeling a bit sick. What the hell am I doing to myself? The thought rolls over in my mind. I remember one elderly woman in my home village in Hertfordshire, who used to walk bent double. Osteoporosis is an old ladies' problem, I tell myself angrily. I am only 27. Yet all too soon I return to my state of calm apathy. I pretend that my bones aren't really thin and weak. I'm strong and perfectly healthy, I tell myself, even though I am on calcium and Vitamin D supplements for life, I get dizzy when I stand up, and blood tests show I have been suffering badly from anaemia - a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin in the blood. To improve my bone density I should eat more and gain a little weight. But my life is ""too busy"" to deal with the stress of challenging the last remnants of my anorexic behaviour. I still add up my daily calorie count on a calculator, and I am prone to lash out at anyone who forces to me to eat things I am scared of, such as cake, pastry and cream. This year I have at least allowed a friend to coax me into ordering salad with oil - this fills me with pride, though at the same time I feel ashamed of the years I spent worrying over salad dressing. But I need to go further. Osteoporosis is not the only long-term effect of my anorexia. The loss of bone density has also affected my teeth, which ache and easily rot. Since the beginning of the year I have spent ¬£4,200 ($5,500) on dental treatment, including eight fillings, root canal treatment, two crowns and an implant. ""The lack of calcium and vitamin D is definitely contributing to this,"" says my doctor - a GP who  happens to be a specialist in eating disorders. One upshot of my weak teeth and gums is that after years of being subject to psychological barriers that restricted my diet, I now have physical ones. Anything chewy, crunchy or cold is almost impossible to eat. Information and Support: Eating disorders It is difficult to predict how badly anorexia will affect each sufferer's long-term health: bodies react in different ways. Other possible long-term effects can include infertility and difficulty conceiving, heart problems, and kidney and liver complications, according to the UK-based eating disorders charity, Beat.  ""I don't think people realise the dangers of the illness and its physical and mental consequences, including the suicide risk. I know it frightens people, but we need to know the facts,"" says Jane Smith, chief executive of the UK-registered charity Anorexia and Bulimia Care. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for treating anorexia instruct doctors to explain to sufferers that the main way of preventing and treating low bone density is ""reaching and maintaining a healthy body weight or BMI for their age"". If I am entirely honest with myself, I know I have to try a little bit harder if I am to minimise the long-term consequences of anorexia. I certainly cannot go backwards. I have enough purpose in my life to want to live it. I have a job as a journalist that I love, friends I trust, and parents who support my every move. One morning this May, one of my closest friends, Leila, sent me a WhatsApp message in response to one of my many rants. I was tired and fed-up with life. ""I'm not going to tell you a few kilos won't make you fat, because that's what's in your head,"" she wrote. ""I'm going to tell you that you get to choose between being 'fat' and functioning, or thin and bed-bound. You get to be thin but your life is over. That's all there is to it."" What can I say?

Long or short? Fitted or puffy? But for Princess Eugenie there was an extra factor at play. The Queen's granddaughter had major surgery on her back to treat a curvature of the spine at the age of 12. Sixteen years on, and the princess chose to wear a wedding dress that showed her scar, saying she hoped it would honour those who had helped her and inspire others with the condition of scoliosis. Ahead of the wedding, the princess spoke of the importance of showing ""people your scars"". And earlier this year she revealed for the first time her own X-rays from when she was treated for scoliosis as a child. ""I had an operation when I was 12 on my back, and you'll see on Friday [at the wedding], but it's a lovely way to honour the people who looked after me and a way of standing up for young people who also go through this,"" she told ITV's This Morning.  ""I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it's really special to stand up for that."" Scoliosis is a condition that causes the spine to bend to one side, making the back appear rounded and shoulder blades stick out. It most often starts in children aged 10 to 15 but there is often no known cause. Sometimes it is caused by the bones not forming properly in the womb or other medical conditions, including cerebral palsy. Three to four children in 1,000 need treatment from a specialist. The Scoliosis Association UK says about five out of six people with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are female - but it is not known why.  In Princess Eugenie's case, it required corrective surgery and she had the operation at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital.  The princess, now 28, has previously spoken of how she felt in the weeks before her surgery, saying it was ""a scary prospect for a 12-year-old; I can still vividly remember how nervous I felt"". ""During my operation, which took eight hours, my surgeons inserted eight-inch titanium rods into each side of my spine and one-and-a-half inch screws at the top of my neck. After three days in intensive care, I spent a week on a ward and six days in a wheelchair, but I was walking again after that,"" she says in her story on the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital's website. Trainee teacher Camilla Seckin also had surgery for the condition at the same hospital. ""I was really terrified and really in denial about having the surgery, but I knew it was something that I had to get done.  ""At this point my back was at a 72-degree curvature and the prognosis was that I'd be in a wheel chair by the age of 30.  ""I felt very insecure about my appearance but I feel confident now and I'm not ashamed of having the condition."" Camilla encourages sufferers to speak up ""as it can be quite lonely if you don't"".  ""Building a network with people who have had the surgery has really helped me. I can still do things despite my condition."" Jan Lehovsky, a spinal surgeon who was part of the team who operated on the princess, said: ""Most of the patients affected by scoliosis are young girls and she's a real role model for them.  ""She's someone who can inspire them, which is so important for the young ladies coming through the surgery.""",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-45834011,"Doctors' use of Caesarean section to deliver babies has nearly doubled in 15 years to reach ""alarming"" proportions in some countries, a study says.  Rates surged from about 16 million births (12%) in 2000 to an estimated 29.7 million (21%) in 2015, the report in the medical journal The Lancet said. The nation with the highest rate for using the surgery to assist childbirth is the Dominican Republic with 58.1%. Doctors say in many cases the use of the medical procedure is unjustified. Until recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggested that Caesarean section - or C-section - rates of more than 15% were excessive. The study analysed data from 169 countries using statistics from 2015 - the most recent year for which the information is available.  It says there is an over-reliance on Caesarean section procedures - when surgery is used to help with a difficult birth - in more than half of the world's nations. Researchers reported a rate of more than 50% in the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Egypt and Turkey, though Brazil implemented a policy in 2015 to reduce the number of Caesarean sections performed by doctors.  They also found huge disparities in the use of the technique between rich and poor nations. In some circumstances, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, the surgery is unavailable when it is genuinely required.  Use in 2015 was up to 10 times more frequent in the Latin America and Caribbean region, at 44% of births, than in the west and central Africa region, where it was used in just 4% of cases.  The study urges healthcare professionals, women and their families to only choose a Caesarean when it is needed for medical reasons - and for more education and training to be offered to dispel some of the concerns surrounding childbirth. A Caesarean section can be a life-saving procedure for both mother and infant if, for example, a baby is in an awkward position in the womb or if labour is not progressing as it should be. Jane Sandall, professor of social science and women's health at King's College London and an author of one of the studies, told the BBC that the risk for mothers and babies can be both short and long-term. ""In particular, C-sections have a more complicated recovery for the mother, and lead to scarring of the womb, which is associated with bleeding, abnormal development of the placenta, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth and preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies."" Prof Sandall says it is important to note that these are small but serious risks, but each of these risks increases with each time a woman undergoes the surgery. ""There is emerging evidence that babies born via C-section have different hormonal, physical, bacterial and medical exposures during birth, which can subtly alter their health. While the long-term risks of this are not well-researched, the short-term effects include changes in immune development which can increase the risk of allergies and asthma and alter the bacteria in the gut."" ""There is the risk that comes with any type of surgery,"" Prof Sandall said, adding that multiple Caesarean procedures lead to a higher risk of maternal mortality when compared with a natural birth. Earlier this week, the WHO published guidance highlighting the need to reduce unnecessary procedures that ""cannot be medically justified"". ""It is crucial that women who need Caesarean sections are able to access this potentially life-saving procedure,"" the WHO advises, adding that it is equally important that unnecessary procedures be avoided ""so women and their babies are not put at risk"". Prof Sandall says that reasons vary from country to country and that with poorer nations, choices are extremely limited.  ""Globally, drivers for the increasing rates vary between countries and include a lack of midwives to prevent and detect problems, loss of medical skills to confidently and competently attend a [potentially difficult] vaginal delivery, as well as medico-legal issues."" She adds that financial incentives exist for both doctor and hospital with the certainty of planned day-time deliveries, especially in private practices. ""In some cases the trend is system-driven. In Brazil, for example, the free public healthcare system is of poorer quality and pregnant mothers who can't afford private healthcare might be offered the procedure to help clear patients more quickly through the system.""  ""In China, a shortage of midwives can result in a lack of screening, meaning not only that necessary medical checks are not being carried out, but that there is a lack of expert help with assisting childbirth."" Variation exists within countries between the urban wealthy giving birth in private facilities where there are high rates of Caesarean section and the rural poor without access to the procedure, Prof Sandall says. ""The issue for women is how do you plan?"" Prof Sandall says.  ""Conjecture that blames mothers for the high Caesarean section rate, either because of their poor health - eg, obesity, hypertension - or because they are demanding medically unnecessary Caesarean sections due to fear or disinterest in labour ignores the wider systems issues that drive the growing reliance on caesarean sections. ""Pregnant mothers must have access to professional and informed advice in order to make a decision."" She adds that the focus must now be on providing more frontline staff at facilities in countries where the issue is of greatest concern.  ""We need to start working with insurance companies in these countries to help with the provision of services and staff, as well as dealing with local and national governments to invest in healthcare.""  Campaigners say some women who request an elective Caesarean sometimes ""meet judgmental attitudes"". They argue that some expectant mothers who ask for the procedure may be survivors of sexual abuse, or suffer from poor physical or mental health.  A Caesarean section is when a baby is delivered by making a surgical cut in the abdomen and womb. They fall into three categories:  Recovering from Caesarean surgery usually takes longer than from a natural birth. The wound eventually forms a scar.",,,,

Her daughter, Favour, was delivered stillborn after failings in her care at the Royal Glamorgan hospital in January 2017. Mrs Udeogu believes her child would still be alive if staff had listened to her calls for help. Cwm Taf health board acknowledged there had been failings. An investigation by the health board following Favour's death found midwives failed to carry out any required antenatal checks on Mrs Udeogu for 12 hours - and when they did no heartbeat was found.  ""[The consultant] said to me he was sorry but my baby was gone...I had my baby and she was lifeless,"" said Mrs Udeogu, who was studying at the University of South Wales and now lives in Nigeria, about 4,000 miles from where her baby is buried in Glyntaff Cemetery in Pontypridd. ""I never planned it that way, I was ready for my baby, I had everything, I'd bought everything I needed to buy...just at the end of it, it was all mistakes and I lost my baby.""   She shared her story with BBC Wales after Cwm Taf announced it was investigating the stillbirths of 20 babies and six babies who died shortly after birth at its maternity units.                    Mrs Udeogu was 41 weeks pregnant with her first child when she started getting contraction pains and rang the hospital at 05:15 GMT on 14 January 2017.  She was told she could go home by a registrar, who checked the baby's heart rate and instructed a plan of care for close observation, however she was admitted to the ward after being too worried to leave. But despite repeatedly asking for help, her baby was not checked again for another 12 hours, when no trace of a heartbeat was found and at 23:20 she was told her daughter was dead. ""I was really devastated,"" she said. ""It's something I don't wish to happen to my enemy, because my husband was not in the UK, my parents were not there, I only have friends around me, I do not have any family members around me, so it was really isolating for me,"" she said. Mrs Udeogu was induced the next morning, and her daughter, Favour Adaoma was delivered stillborn at 10:50 on 15 January, weighing 3.61kg (7.95lbs).  ""The moment I had my baby she was dead, but I was thinking she was sleeping, because I didn't really believe what was happening to me,"" she said. ""It was the next morning that I came back to my senses that I don't have my baby any more."" With the support of her friends Mrs Udeogu buried her daughter before she returned to Nigeria in April.  ""Since I've been back in Nigeria I've only had memories....I would like to visit her,"" she said. An investigation by the health board found midwives failed in their duty of care of Mrs Udeogu by not performing neonatal assessments, which are required every four hours according to guidelines. The report also found poor communication between midwives and staffing issues on the ward, with one midwife saying they felt overwhelmed and extremely stressed that day. Months after the review, the board wrote to Mrs Udeogu's solicitors to offer their ""sincere apologies for the way in which our services let her down"".  It accepted her care fell below an acceptable standard but said it was not possible to confirm whether the baby would have survived if she had been delivered sooner. ""In the early hours of the morning she had a heartbeat, they told me everything was fine,"" said Mrs Udeogu. ""I was just shocked and surprised at the end of it, after so many hours when they checked me and told me that my baby was gone. ""I believe that if I was properly monitored in the hospital I wouldn't have lost her"".  A Cwm Taf spokeswoman said: ""As in every case where failings are identified an apology is made and appropriate redress offered. ""Losing a baby is a devastating experience and we sincerely sympathise with all those who have experienced such a sad loss.  ""The review we have announced into how some past cases were investigated has inevitably caused anxiety, but we would like to assure all the women who use our maternity service that every safeguard is in place to ensure they are provided with the best possible care.""",,,,

The men in the photo above may not conform to the classic image of aid workers in Africa. A more traditional shots would show a nurse caring for a sick child - and the nurse would quite likely be a visiting European. But the vast majority of people who run aid projects on the continent are in fact Africans. And a huge amount of their time is necessarily devoted to confronting the difficulties of delivering assistance in remote places with poor roads or flooded tracks.  Team leader Robert Ntitima was nearing the end of a 700km (435 mile) journey from the Zambian capital, Lusaka, to the village of Malumba in the far west of the country.  He was taking an eye surgeon to operate on patients facing blindness when his car got stuck in a sand drift. As night began to fall, a fire started by a farmer to clear the bush swept towards the vehicle.  You may also be interested in: The flames threatened to ignite the fuel tank and blow up the car.  Mr Ntitima and driver Clinton Bakala had no choice but to beat back the fire with sticks before using their bare hands to dig out the two-tonne vehicle. A chain and another four-wheel drive were then used to finally pull the car free. Relieved to be out of the sand, Mr Ntitima nevertheless paused to ring his family before setting off again.  It was the birthday of his four-year-old daughter, Sally Mika. He promised they would have her party when he eventually got home.        It had been a typical day for the aid workers in western Zambia. Earlier, the car carrying the eye surgeon, Bruno Kandei, got bogged down on a flooded stretch of road.  Dr Kandei is a specialist in correcting blinding trachoma, the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world. He is currently working on behalf of international charity Sightsavers. In addition to his surgical skills, he has to be an expert in getting cars out of floods.  ""Bruno"" is a nickname. His 1980s boyhood friends borrowed it from their expat British schoolteacher in the western Zambian town of Kalabo. The boy and Bruno the teacher were both keen football players. The name ""Bruno"" stuck with the Zambian.   Dr Kandei's real first name is ""Kubona"".  ""In my language 'Kubona' translates into English as 'the ability to see,'"" Dr Kandei, 53, explained. ""Maybe my name was the Lord's way of showing me I should help cure blindness."" After a two-day journey, team leader Mr Ntitima and Dr Kandei finally reached the small rural clinic where their patients were waiting. The cars carrying the dozen or so patients had also got stuck on rough tracks several times. But now everyone was in the right place for the surgery to take place.  Latest figures show that nearly 158 million people worldwide are at risk from blinding trachoma, a disease caused by infection of the eye.  Around half of these have been treated with antibiotics, but much work remains to be done.   Blinding trachoma is one of the so-called neglected tropical diseases, most of which affect very poor communities. Other examples are guinea worm and sleeping sickness. They attract minimal attention because their impact does not generate an immediate medical emergency as is usually the case, for example, with Ebola disease.  In many older people blinding trachoma, if untreated, causes in-growing eyelashes. The lashes scratch the eye, causing great pain and, ultimately, blindness. The infection thrives in very poor communities without access to a reliable supply of clean water, or toilets. Source: WHO, NHS Half the village at risk of blindness Combating trachoma in Sudan ""It's like having small spears scratching your eyes all day long,"" said Sibeso Simate, 72, who was waiting for her operation at the rural clinic in western Zambia. ""They scratch every time you blink,"" the mother of two said. ""Scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch."" The surgery is a relatively simple operation that takes about 20 minutes. It involves rotating the infected eyelid back to its correct position so the eyelashes are no longer scratching the eye.  With just a local anaesthetic being used, Ms Simate was happily chatting with her surgeon throughout the procedure.  Dr Kandei carried out half a dozen similar operations in the rural clinic before the fading light forced him to stop. Conditions there were very basic - there was no electric light.  He and his colleagues travel to rural areas for a fortnight every two months to reach patients who cannot make it to hospitals in the larger towns. Mr Ntitima made it back home to Lusaka safely. His daughter Sally Mika had her wish for a birthday party come true - complete with cake and candles.  She also had an extra treat - a visit to an adventure playground.",,,,

The strategy, announced by Prime Minister Theresa May, will also see postal delivery workers checking in on isolated people during their rounds.  The government says about 200,000 older people have not had a conversation with a friend or relative in over a month.  And many GPs see between one and five people a day suffering with loneliness.  As part of the long-term plan, funding will be provided to connect NHS patients in England to a variety of activities, such as cookery classes, walking clubs and art groups, by 2023. Announcing an extra ¬£1.8m for community projects, such as creating new community cafes, art spaces or gardens, Mrs May said social prescriptions would reduce demand on the NHS and improve patients' quality of life. The government will also partner with the Royal Mail on a new scheme in Liverpool, New Malden and Whitby to give postal workers a front-line role in tackling loneliness. And a network of  businesses - including Sainsbury's, Transport for London, the Co-op, British Red Cross, National Grid and Civil Service - have pledged to take further action to support their employees' health and social wellbeing. Launching the first loneliness strategy, Mrs May said: ""This strategy is only the beginning of delivering a long and far reaching social change in our country - but it is a vital first step in a national mission to end loneliness in our lifetimes."" She paid tribute to murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, who had campaigned to end loneliness before her death: ""Jo Cox was absolutely right to highlight the critical importance of this growing social injustice which sits alongside childhood obesity and mental wellbeing as one of the greatest public health challenges of our time. ""I was pleased to be able to support the Loneliness Commission set up in Jo's name and I am determined to do everything possible to take forward its recommendations."" Kim Leadbeater, Ms Cox's sister, on behalf of the Jo Cox Foundation, said: ""The important thing now is to turn the dialogue and strategy into action. ""That is undoubtedly what Jo would want and for every life that is made less lonely as a result of the work she started and that we have all continued, we will take great comfort.  ""I look forward to this happening in the coming months and years.""",,,,

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says England is falling behind other countries on obesity, mental health and infant deaths.  It predicts rising health problems by 2030 without changes in policy. An NHS England spokeswoman said the report provided ""useful context"" for its long-term funding plan. The plan is set to be published this year. Currently, children in England are measured at primary school, up to the ages of 10 and 11, but not after that. The report, Child Health in 2030 in England, says more needs to be done to halt obesity. It compared different aspects of children and young people's health in England with 14 other European Union countries plus Australia, Canada and Norway. The report found England has poorer health outcomes than the average across those 18 countries and, based on recent trends, is likely to fall further behind them over the next decade. The report highlighted: Poverty lies at the root of many major child health challenges, the report says, and a properly-funded health strategy focused on children and young people would help turn things around. It says England has seen some successes - in how diabetes is controlled, in rapidly reducing smoking rates among young people and low numbers of death from injuries. And it acknowledges that the government's childhood obesity plan is likely to ""help to reverse current obesity trends"". The report makes a series of recommendations, including: Prof Russell Viner, report author and president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""This report clearly identifies the danger on the horizon - but trends shown here are not inevitable.  ""Each of them could be turned around if key actions are undertaken."" He said it was ""hugely encouraging"" that child and maternal health had been highlighted in the NHS England long-term plan, which is published soon. He added the plan was ""a crucial opportunity for improving child health"". ""Act now or the consequences are grave,"" was Prof Viner's message to policy-makers. Alana Ryan, from the NSPCC, said it was unacceptable that so many children were unable to access help mental health support from local services when they needed it most. ""Young people's mental and emotional wellbeing must be a top priority in the new NHS England strategy."" The Royal College of Nursing said the report painted ""a bleak picture for children and young people"". And it said health visitors and school nurses were ""the front-line defence against childhood obesity and poor child mental health"" but all too often they were understaffed.  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Improving children's mental and physical health is a key priority for this government and will be pivotal in our long term plan for the NHS, which we're backing with additional funding of an extra ¬£20.5 billion a year by 2023/24.""",,,,

Which? tested the durability of 10 gates and their tests found that three failed to meet EU safety standards.  The group believes there should be an immediate recall of the Dreambaby Retractable Gate, which it says failed after just 10 applications of force. The manufacturer said it investigated all complaints about its products.  The other gates which failed Which?'s testing were the Lindam Easy Fit Plus Deluxe Safety Gate and the Safetots Self-closing Gate. Which? said all three were currently available in major high street shops and online.  The products were attached with adhesive pads and tested by applying the ""fatigue test"" 10,000 times.  The test forms part of the EU safety standard for stair gates and is designed to simulate the gate being pulled back and forth by a child over time.  For the Dreambaby Retractable Gate, Which? said the metal tube attached to the gate became bent and detached from the casing that holds it in place, leading to the gate sagging in the middle.  The Safetots gate failed after 3,700 applications of force, with the adhesive pads that secure the gate to a door frame becoming detatched. The gate can also be fitted using screws and in this case passed the testing. In the Which? tests, the adhesive pads also became detached from the Lindam gate after 2,570 applications of force.  Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said the findings were ""shocking"". He said: ""The manufacturers need to act urgently to prevent any more children from being put at risk by products which may be unsafe."" Dreambaby said complaints about its products were ""rare"" but were investigated immediately. In a statement, the company said: ""Our ability to undertake a thorough investigation of the matters raised have been significantly frustrated by the failure of Which? to provide sufficient background detail despite our repeated requests for this information.  ""We are therefore unable to provide a considered response at this time.' Munchkin, the company that owns Lindam, said it was not aware of any evidence supporting the allegations and its gates met European safety standards.  Safetots also disputed the findings and said its gate met the standards that Which? had tested.

The former BBC Breakfast anchor, who's now a presenter on Classic FM, said: ""I just couldn't bear it any longer.""  After that round of chemo in July - his eighth - he went on to have one more.  Turnbull said he coped with the ""bad phases"" of chemo by watching ""lots"" of TV, including all 67 episodes of Game of Thrones. The broadcaster, who was diagnosed with incurable prostate cancer in November 2017, told Radio Times he does not see himself as courageous for talking about cancer. But he said he was glad doing so had raised awareness of the condition.  He told the magazine: ""It's the fact that having cancer is so relentlessly boring. You go to bed at night thinking about it, and it's still there when you wake up.  ""It's there all day, every day - a fact of life you have to get used to. And it's a massive pain in the backside.""   Turnbull, whose cancer has spread to the bone - across his pelvis, hips, legs and spine - said of chemo: ""Each round felt worse.""  He lost his sense of taste, and some days could only cope by lying down to wait ""for the feeling of crushing fatigue and nausea to pass"".  By round six, ""it felt as if the chemo was now taking on a life of its own, like some malevolent gremlin"".  As well as watching TV, he said he coped by presenting his radio show and listening to music.  Speaking of his decision to go public about his diagnosis, which he did in March, Turnbull said he wanted ""to show men it could happen to anyone"".  He told the magazine. ""I'd had my prostate checked when I was 40, and again when I was 50. I thought that had put me in the clear, but it didn't.  ""There were no early warning signs, and by the time I felt anything, it was too late.""    He said people had got in touch to say they had gone to get checked as a result of Turnbull's experience, adding: ""It doesn't make everything worthwhile, but it certainly helps to know that someone will stay alive as a result of my experience. ""It's gratifying, then, to see the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, confirming that more men are coming forward and being treated as a result of the experiences of Stephen Fry and me.""  He said it had not taken courage to declare he had cancer, but praised BBC journalist Rachael Bland for her podcasts and blogs about breast cancer before she died at the age of 40.

He said: ""I'm still optimistic about hanging around for some time yet.""

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45861476,"Scientists say they have found a way to make self-lubricating latex condoms that become slippery on contact. It is thanks to a special, durable coating that should last throughout intercourse, says the team, backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They hope it will make condoms more appealing to use and thereby prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as well as unwanted pregnancies.  Without enough lubrication, sex can be painful and condoms may split or slip.  When used correctly, condoms are a highly effective contraceptive, but not everyone likes them. They are often already lubricated to make them easier to use, but sometimes this might not be enough for comfort. People can add lubricant, but this can be messy and may need several applications, interrupting sex.   Researchers say the self-lubricating condom, which becomes really slippery once it comes into contact with body fluid, should get round this.  It could withstand intercourse involving at least 1,000 thrusts without losing its slipperiness, the Royal Society Open Science journal reports. According to the researchers, intercourse typically lasts half that time, but some sessions are longer. When tested for comparison, regular condoms coated with a shop-bought, water-based liquid lubricant were more slippery initially, but became less so after around 600 thrusts. A group of volunteers were also asked to touch and rate both condoms, in terms of slip and slide.  Most of the 33 men and women rated the self-lubricating one more highly.  Researcher Prof Mark Grinstaff, from Boston University, said: ""It feels a bit slimy when you handle it dry, but in the presence of water or natural fluids it becomes really slick. You only need a little bit of fluid to activate it."" The researchers say more tests are needed to compare how well the self-lubricating condom performs against other brands of condoms in real-life settings.  Clinical trials with couples could begin early next year, says Prof Grinstaff.  A spin-off company from the university is now planning to develop a product for the commercial market, subject to regulatory approval.  Dr Nicola Irwin, from Queen's University, Belfast, is an expert in healthcare materials and technology. She said similar ""hydrophilic"" coatings have been used in urinary catheters to improve comfort.  ""These coated catheters are, in general, associated with a greater degree of user acceptability than the alterative uncoated and gel-lubricated devices. This user preference is mainly due to the reduced levels of discomfort upon insertion, together with the ease of handling and convenience of 'ready-to-use' hydrophilic-coated catheters.  ""It may be expected that the newly developed hydrophilic-coated condoms could afford similar benefits, but we need more trials."" Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong, Australia, have been working on making a self-lubricating condom out of tough hydrogels rather than latex or rubber, that feel more like real skin.  Bekki Burbidge, from the sexual health charity FPA, said: ""We welcome new innovations to encourage condom use. Condoms are the only method of contraception that also help to protect against STIs, so it's important that people feel confident and comfortable using them.  ""Lubrication can make sex more comfortable and enjoyable so we encourage people to try out different water-based lubricants as well as different sizes, shapes and textures of condoms to find out what suits them and enhances their sexual pleasure.""",,,,

Canada has become the second country after Uruguay to legalise possession and use of recreational cannabis.  Medical marijuana has been legal in the country since 2001.  But concerns remain, including about the readiness for police forces to tackle drug impaired driving.  Information has been sent to 15m households about the new laws and there are public awareness campaigns. Ian Power, from the town of St John's began queuing at 20:00 local time so he could ""make history"". Newfoundland is half an hour ahead of the next province to the west. ""It's been my dream to be the first person to buy the first legal gram of cannabis in Canada, and here I finally am,"" he said. Canadian provinces and municipalities have been preparing for months for the end of cannabis prohibition. They are responsible for setting out where cannabis can be bought and consumed.   This has created a patchwork of more or less restrictive legislation across the country. There remain unanswered questions on some key issues around how legal cannabis will work in Canada. A number of analysts are predicting a shortage of recreational marijuana in the first year of legalisation as production and licensing continues to ramp up to meet demand. And the marketplace itself is still in its infancy. Ontario, Canada's most populous province, will only begin opening retail stores next spring, though residents will be able to order cannabis online. British Columbia, one of the provinces with the highest rates of cannabis use, will only have one legal store open on Wednesday. Until retail locations are more widely available, some unlicensed cannabis retailers, which have flourished in the years since the law was first proposed, may stay open. It is unclear if police will crack down on them immediately, or if they will turn a blind eye. Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Vancouver  Legal pot has been an inescapable topic for months in Canada, as governments and companies prepared in earnest for 17 October.  That day is finally here, and Canadians will learn just how much - or how little - the new framework will change the country. But this is not just a domestic affair. With global trends shifting away from a strict prohibition of cannabis, the world will be watching this national experiment in drug liberalisation.    A measure of success - whether legalisation will be a win for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ahead of the 2019 federal election - will depend on whether it meets his stated goals: restricting access of the drug to youth - who are among the heaviest users in Canada - reducing the burden of cannabis laws on the justice system, and undercutting the illicit market for the drug. And if the outcomes are positive, other countries might just be more willing to follow suit. Legalisation fulfils a 2015 campaign promise by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the leader of the governing Liberal Party. The prime minister has argued that Canada's nearly century-old laws criminalising use of the drug have been ineffective, given that Canadians are still among the world's heaviest users. He said the new law is designed to keep drugs out of the hands of minors and profits out of the hands of criminals. The federal government also predicts it will raise $400m a year in tax revenues on the sale of cannabis. Cannabis possession first became a crime in Canada in 1923 but medical use has been legal since 2001. Canada follows in the footsteps of Uruguay, which became the first country in the world to legalise the sale of cannabis for recreational use in 2013. A number of US states have also voted to end prohibition. Medical marijuana is also gaining ground in many European countries. Portugal and the Netherlands have decriminalised the drug. South Africa's highest court legalised the use of cannabis by adults in private places in September, though the sale of the drug remains a crime.  In April, Zimbabwe became the second country in Africa, after Lesotho, to legalise the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Nine US states have legalised recreational marijuana use while many more allow its use on medical grounds. Adults will be able buy cannabis oil, seeds and plants and dried cannabis from licensed producers and retailers and to possess up to 30 grams (one ounce) of dried cannabis in public, or its equivalent.  Edibles, or cannabis-infused foods, will not be immediately available for purchase but will be within a year of the bill coming into force. The delay is meant to give the government time to set out regulations specific to those products. It will be illegal to possess more than 30 grams in public, grow more than four plants per household and to buy from an unlicensed dealer. Penalties for some infraction will be severe. Someone caught selling the drug to a minor could be jailed for up to 14 years. Some critics say the penalties are too harsh and not proportional to similar laws like those around selling alcohol to minors. On Monday, the Canadian Medical Association Journal published an editorial calling legalisation ""a national, uncontrolled experiment in which the profits of cannabis producers and tax revenues are squarely pitched against the health of Canadians"".  There are also still some legal wrinkles to be worked out. Canada has brought in new drug impaired driving offences, but doubts remain about the reliability of screening technology and the potential for drugged driving cases to clog up the courts. Federal statistics indicate that about half of all cannabis users do not believe their driving is impaired after taking marijuana. On Wednesday, government officials announced they will present legislation intended to fast-track pardon applications of people who have been convicted of possession under 30g (one ounce). There are currently some 500,000 Canadians with existing criminal records for possession.  The change in national drug policy has also created headaches with the US, where the drug remains federally a controlled substance. On Tuesday, the US Customs Border Protection Agency said border guards will have ""broad latitude"" to determine who is admissible to the country. Border guards may ask Canadians if they smoke cannabis, and deny them entry if they believe they intend to do so in the US. Canada has also been rolling out signs at all airports and border crossings to warn travellers that crossing international borders with the drug remains illegal.",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45769815,"A salad nearly killed my brother.  It was the mid-1990s. The incident involved a self-service counter and one bowl that contained hidden nuts.  Adam was 10 years old. I was older, but still at school. I remember the nurse coming into my classroom to say he had been taken to hospital and I should make my own way home. My dad phoned me when I got there, trying to reassure me that everyone would be home soon. But knowing he must have raced back early from work, I felt uneasy.  What I didn't know was that Adam was in a critical condition in an A&E bed. My parents had always avoided giving him nuts, because I had a severe allergy and we suspected he might too. This accidental consumption was the first proof. His body had gone into anaphylactic shock - a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to an allergen.  Luckily, due to fast treatment, he pulled through. Afterwards, he got his first Epipen - a self-administering adrenalin injection - to give him a better first line of defence. My mum also complained to the supermarket and they changed their salad-bar policy, labelling the contents of each bowl and tethering the cartons to reduce risks of cross-contamination.  Over the years, we have both got used to having the occasional ""run in"" with a nut. You do all that you can to be careful. You check the menu; you quiz the waiters; you scan the small print in the supermarket; you ask questions when anyone offers you a biscuit. You essentially do a risk assessment every time you eat, and mostly without realising you're doing it.  Yet sometimes you slip up, or the restaurant does. Maybe a waiter forgets to pass your message on. Or perhaps you take a carefree bite into a Mexican taco because who puts peanuts in tacos? (Answer: an experimental London chef.)  Cases of nut allergy among children increased significantly during the 1990s, according to the UK-based support group the Anaphylaxis Campaign.  Researchers are trying to work out why this is happening, and what can be done, including experimenting with weaning and desensitisation trials.  In the meantime, those of us who belong to this unfortunate club have been adapting to survive.  And to avoid overhyping, it is worth pointing out that deaths are still rare. US researchers have said people are more likely to die in an accident or be murdered. Which is reassuring, I suppose.  The mother's take Lucy Patterson, who works for a charity near Cardiff, has a four-year-old son who has a whole host of severe allergies.  The first sign of Jack's problem came when he was five months old and cow's milk in his porridge sent him into anaphylactic shock. Tests afterwards showed he was allergic to milk, eggs and nuts. ""When we buy food, we double and triple check the labels. Even if we bought the product before,"" she says. Jack also carries two Epipens at all times.  As a family, they have decided not to eat out or travel abroad while he is young, but she hopes he will be able to do both in the future. ""I don't want to bring Jack up in fear. My job is to educate and protect him as much as I can, and that's easy when he's four.  ""He is likely to eat out when he's older, so my job then is to ensure he asks the right questions, always carries his Epipens and that the friends he is with know the situation fully."" When I read the recent news that Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died after eating a Pret baguette, I knew the panic she must have gone through. That moment when you first reach for an antihistamine tablet, or an Epipen, and are unsure if your body can bring the situation back under control.  I have had chefs and waiters refuse to believe me when I say I am having an allergic reaction. ""There were no nuts in that dish,"" they insist flatly.  But it is not debatable as far as I am concerned. When there are nuts in a dish - particularly peanuts - I know as soon as the fork touches my tongue. Within seconds, my whole mouth and throat are overwhelmed by an intensely unpleasant sensation that is hard to describe. It is not a taste, more like an anti-taste, which sucks all other flavours out of my mouth, leaving a dry burn.  Not all reactions are the same, though. Aside from the more serious effects of anaphylaxis, some people wheeze, others get stomach cramps. According to the British Medical Journal, one of the symptoms is a ""sense of impending doom"", which I find darkly hilarious but also true. The varying degrees of severity mean that some people are more willing to take risks than others. I remember a waiter at a hotel-restaurant once refusing to accept there were any nuts in what he had just served me. Fearing my throat might start to close, I wasn't in a position to continue arguing, but I knew there was no doubt. Once I had recovered, the waiter and the chef came to my room to apologise; they admitted there were peanuts in an appetiser, there had been a miscommunication. The hotel owners also visited me the next day, saying this had never happened before and they were going to do all they could to ensure it didn't happen again, starting by briefing all staff.  Obviously I would have preferred not to have been the guinea pig, but this felt like progress. I had been listened to and taken seriously - eventually.  The chef's take US chef and television host Amanda Freitag has a serious hazelnut allergy and ran a hazelnut-free kitchen when she was at the helm of New York City's Empire Diner.  ""As soon as I started to talk about my allergy, some of my other colleagues revealed they have food allergies as well,"" she says. ""It's not something a chef always wants to discuss because we don't want to be limited in what we eat or cook. But I find it a welcome challenge to make a dish without the allergen. I like working to make the dish just as good or better."" Her advice to other chefs would be to take all allergies and food sensitivities very seriously.  ""Do consistent menu training with all your staff - kitchen and front of the house - so that they are aware of all the ingredients in every dish and, if they are uncertain, to always come to the kitchen and ask to confirm,"" she says. ""Having menu descriptions written and constantly updated for the staff to reference is essential."" Pret A Manger - a major UK sandwich chain - has been under scrutiny for its approach to labelling after two deaths linked to its products, first Natasha and also in a dairy-allergy case.  In 2015, I accidentally ate nuts in a Pret sandwich and I emailed them to ask if they would consider labels on the products. They told me this would be ""impossible"" and they only sought to ""provide a description of the flavours one may expect in a sandwich"". Natasha died the following year.  After an inquest,  they have now agreed to bring in labels.  On the other end of the scale, I remember one major supermarket going through a phase of labelling everything with ""May contain nuts"" - even ham and orange squash. That was not particularly helpful.  However, other companies have been praised for their approach. In the UK, many nut-allergy sufferers are fond of Welsh chocolate company Kinnerton, which prides itself on going to ""extraordinary lengths"" to make their produce safe. They even created two factories - one for nut produce, one for nut-free produce. If you want to set foot in the latter, you have to sign a document saying you have not eaten nuts that day or brought any with you.  Airlines - which traditionally serve peanuts as on-board snacks - have also been under pressure to adapt to the times.  It was in mid-air that my brother had his second-most serious anaphylactic shock. He now picks his flights based on their nut policy. British Airways still serves some nuts, so they are on the ""no"" list. Whereas EasyJet will agree to stop serving all nuts if you let them know, and this reassures him.

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-45804613,"Hannah Jenkins speaks English in the morning and German in the afternoon. It's not a routine she chose to adopt - but something her brain requires her to do. It all started with a cycling accident.   Her partner Andrew Wilde was halfway up a mountain in the US state of Montana when he received a baffling text from Hannah. He understood only two words - ""dog"" and ""hospital"" - but knew instinctively something was wrong. The text was in German, a language Hannah had grown up with, but Andrew didn't really understand. They only ever communicated in English. Hannah had stayed at home in the UK, running the dog-training business she'd set up in Wokingham, Berkshire, while Andrew had gone to the US to train for an international shooting competition.  He called Hannah's mobile number, but got no response. With growing unease, he started to phone hospitals around Berkshire but couldn't get any information. He knew he needed to get home. He made his way to the airport, unsure of what would be waiting for him when he returned. What he didn't expect to find, was a different Hannah to the one he'd kissed goodbye days earlier. Hannah had been cycling through a park near their home the day before she sent the text to Andrew.  She'd rounded a familiar corner and collided with another cyclist. She remembers little, but paramedics have since filled her in - the other cyclist saw her lying motionless and bleeding on the ground and called emergency services. He waited for help to arrive, told them he'd been cycling no faster than 32km/h (20mph), then left, without giving any more information. An air ambulance was called for Hannah, who had been identified from items in her wallet.  It was touch and go whether she would survive. Listen to the podcast: The bike crash which made me forget English A full transcript is available here. For more Disability News, follow BBC Ouch on Twitter and Facebook, and subscribe to the weekly podcast. Hannah eventually came to on a busy ward in the Royal Berkshire Hospital with no idea where she was, what had happened or why, in her mind, no-one spoke English. ""I couldn't understand anything,"" she says. ""I felt as though I'd woken up in a foreign country and I couldn't understand why people weren't speaking to me in a way that I could understand."" Doctors tended to her in this unfamiliar language. Finally she recognised what she thought was ""name"" and ""date of birth"" - and recited that to anyone who approached. It seemed like the right thing to do. The doctors were puzzled as Hannah's documents all pointed to the fact she lived and worked in the UK. They knew she was called Hannah Jenkins, and yet she didn't understand or respond to English. They contacted her next of kin, her sister Margaret, who asked to speak to Hannah. As Hannah sat in her hospital bed she chatted away on the phone, relieved that she was finally able to communicate with someone. This bemused doctors, because previously she had only uttered the odd, indecipherable word. Hannah had so many questions for Margaret, one of them being why the doctors weren't speaking to her in English.  ""They are, Hannah,"" her sister replied. The crash, it seemed, had knocked Hannah's knowledge of English clear out of her mind. But she was left with the German that she had learnt as a child - the language that she defaulted to when speaking to her sister.  ""The doctors didn't know I could speak German,"" Hannah explains. ""It wasn't until they spoke to my sister that they realised."" The sisters were brought up in the UK speaking German and English, by polyglot parents. Their Austrian mother spoke four languages and their father, a language teacher from Wales, spoke seven. ""German was my first oral language,"" says Hannah. ""It was a rule we had in my house - that when we speak to my family it's always in German, just to keep the language fresh in our heads. ""I couldn't get my head around the fact that in the hospital they were speaking English. My brain had lost my ability to understand that."" Hannah was experiencing something called secondary language loss, according to consultant neurosurgeon Colin Shieff, who is also trustee of brain injury charity Headway. ""Our brains are very sensitive and anything that has the ability to disturb the computer in any way can potentially impact upon the words coming out,"" he says. ""There is no algorithm that would follow that a specific injury will invariably result in the loss of German nouns or English grammar, but we do lose those bits."" He says the skills learned in childhood are those most likely to be retained - the ability to say ""yes"" or ""no"" or even to repeat a nursery rhyme. He says ""something that's been ingrained for ever"" - is more likely to remain intact and those skills learned later, are the first to go. Why did Hannah lose her speech? Information from the brain injury charity, Headway The physical impact of the crash was minimal - a bruised leg and a sore shoulder - so Hannah was discharged within days.  But via her sister, who acted as her translator, she learnt that her brain injury was significant and would take years, rather than months, to improve. She went home and waited for Andrew. ""I was listening to the radio a lot,"" she says. ""I don't know how much I understood, but when my partner came that's when I learned how badly the language was affected."" The couple had been together for eight years, but now Hannah couldn't understand Andrew - and his school German only got him so far. They devised hand signals and their own version of sign language.  As time went on, Hannah's written English improved quicker than the speaking. ""When the communication really broke, we did resort to writing stuff down and texting or emailing each other, even though we were in the same room,"" she says. ""My relationship with Andrew has been affected because you can't not talk to each other just because you're tired or under pressure. ""Having that patience for the situation is always a little bit of a struggle. But I certainly couldn't have done it without him."" Andrew took an 18-month sabbatical from his job to support Hannah. Slowly she regained much of her English language, but it's something that even now, three years on, has not returned completely. It has now become her second language. ""I'm fine in the mornings, but by the afternoon the fatigue really kicks in and I switch in my mind to thinking in German. ""I'll write little notes to myself in German, and I just sort of almost power down that part of my brain that deals with communication, so that in the evening when my partner's back I can communicate again."" The couple also had to come to terms with the fact that Hannah's personality would be likely to change as a result of the crash. She was told she ""might not be the same person post-accident"". ""I think that's the hardest part to get your head around,"" she says. ""It's almost like you have to go through a bereavement process to say goodbye to the old you, before you can get to know the new you. ""But there is that level of resentment there to start with. I was fighting that quite a lot and saying, 'No, I'm still me, don't be silly, this is who I always am'."" Hannah has recognised a few ""subtle changes"" in her personality - she's not as patient as she once was - something that led her to close her business. ""I forgot so much of the theory behind it, my reactions are a lot slower and I don't have the subtlety of language that you need when you have to tell people that this isn't the right dog for them."" She has taken up photography and art, something she studied at university, and has thrown herself into a new sport to improve her focus - shooting. ""Shooting has been described as skilled meditation, and I think that is very true because you have to focus completely on what you're doing. If your brain goes off and ruminates or meanders then your shots do the same. ""To start with I could only do it for about 20 minutes, and now I'm up to about an hour-and-a-half."" The crash on an October afternoon in 2015 altered Hannah's life, language and personality, but it is something to which she has learned to adapt. ""Mentally I have to see that this is",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45887687,"A premature baby whose heart stopped beating for 22 minutes has been called a ""miracle"" by doctors who treated her, as she celebrates her first birthday. Lacey Sherriff, who was born at 27 weeks weighing 1.4lb (635g), had two cardiac arrests during emergency surgery when she was five days old.  Her parents prepared for the worst - but their daughter survived. Doctors at St George's Hospital, in London, say Lacey should develop and live a normal life. Lacey was born via emergency Caesarean section at St Peter's Hospital before being transferred to St George's five days later for urgent surgery to treat a severe bowel condition called necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). During the operation, her heart stopped beating for 12 minutes before doctors managed to stabilise her. And then her heart stopped again - for another 10 minutes. Dr Thomas Breen, consultant anaesthetist at St George's who led the theatre and resuscitation team, said: ""The operation was going well but she deteriorated and we started to fear the worst - but we didn't give up."" He said he had never seen a case of a baby so young and so sick, who had essentially 'died', recovering with no signs of brain damage.  Dr Breen said Lacey was ""clearly a fighter"" who had defied the odds to pull through. Lacey's parents, Louise, 39, and Philip, 41, who live in Ashford, Middlesex, knew she was very unwell and her chances were slim. ""We didn't think she'd survive surgery and thought we'd be registering Lacey's birth and death certificates at the same time,"" Louise said. ""It was such a rollercoaster of emotions - first thinking we'd be going home as a family of four, to three, then back to four again."" Undergoing major surgery at such a young age carries major risks but without it, doctors say, Lacey had little chance of survival. After the surgery, her condition improved slowly each day but she needed further surgery at 13 days old to sort out problems with her stoma, which was fitted during the first operation. Lacey was finally discharged after 111 days in hospital, in February 2018. Mr Zahid Mukhtar, paediatric surgeon at the hospital, said: ""She'll continue to have follow-up appointments but she should develop and live a normal life, which is excellent news.  ""Happy first birthday, Lacey - the miracle baby."" Lacey underwent surgery to reverse the stoma last month, which was successful, allowing her to use her bowel normally. The family are now back at home in Ashford with Lacey and their five-year-old son, Alfie. Louise said the four months Lacey had been in hospital had been very difficult, involving a three-hour round trip to see her from home - but she had known she had been in safe hands. ""My daughter wouldn't be celebrating her first birthday if it wasn't for the staff at St George's.  ""The care from the moment we arrived to when we left was phenomenal. I can't fault it.""",,,,

Scientists measured the fingers of 18 pairs of female identical twins, where one was straight and the other gay. On average, the lesbians, but not the straight twins, had different sized index and ring fingers, typically a male trait, but only on the left hand. This may be the result of exposure to more testosterone in the womb, the University of Essex researchers said. The scientists also measured the fingers of 14 pairs of male identical twins, where one was straight and the other gay, but found no link. Both men and women were exposed to the ""male"" hormone, testosterone, in the womb - but some may be exposed more than others, the scientists said. Study author Dr Tuesday Watts, from the psychology department at Essex University, said:  ""Because identical twins, who share 100% of their genes, can differ in their sexual orientations, factors other than genetics must account for the differences. ""Research suggests that our sexuality is determined in the womb and is dependent on the amount of male hormone we are exposed to or the way our individual bodies react to that hormone, with those exposed to higher levels of testosterone being more likely to be bisexual or homosexual. ""Because of the link between hormone levels and difference in finger lengths, looking at someone's hands could provide a clue to their sexuality."" The findings are published in Archives of Sexual Behaviour.",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-45626460,"Diane Reeve didn't expect to find love again after her 18-year-long marriage fell apart. But in 2002, at the age of 50, she did. It turned out, though, that her new partner, Philippe Padieu, was sleeping around - and had given her HIV. I'd kind of given up on love, but then a couple of people convinced me I was too young to do that and said I should get back out on the market - they suggested online dating. It was pretty brutal and I was just about to give up when I got an enquiry from Philippe. It was just a brief, ""I like your profile, would like to meet,"" but I was intrigued. He was French and very nice looking, and I thought, ""OK, one last time, and that's it."" We met at my martial arts school - he was also a martial artist - and then we went over to a local restaurant and had drinks and appetisers and sat for an hour and talked. I was fascinated and I guess he was too. He had cool stories and told me a lot about himself. That was kind of refreshing because usually it's the other way around, where the woman does all the talking, and I found that exhausting. On that first date I was pretty interested in him, but I couldn't really tell if he was feeling the same thing. But then he made this one flirtatious comment and I thought, ""Oh, OK, he is interested,"" and it went from there, we started dating fairly regularly. Philippe was a security analyst for a large company but he was laid off a year after we started dating. While he was looking for a new job I asked him to help me out at the school.  When he was teaching for me we'd usually go out after work and then spend the night together. We had had the talk about being exclusive pretty early on in the relationship, so I was seeing him three or four times a week and the rest of the time I was busy with the school.  I was happy, he was happy, it was good, and we were together for four-and-half years. In 2006 my daughter was getting married and we had a wonderful ceremony.  Philippe was there - he took a video of the big family occasion - and we were all going for a family dinner afterwards. But then he called me from his cellphone and said, ""I can't go, I'm not feeling well."" He didn't call from his home phone, which made me suspicious, and I was furious because the dinner was very important to me. I went by myself, but on my way home I thought I'd go by Philippe's and check on this poor sick man who couldn't make it to my family dinner. The door was locked, the house was dark, and his car wasn't there. I sat in the driveway and cried for a long time, and then I started to get angry. Because I'd been paying for his cellphone I was able to get into his voicemail. Two different women had left him messages and it was obvious from the voicemails that these were women that he had plans with. I waited for a good hour-and-a-half or more and then finally I saw him coming around the corner.  When he saw my car he immediately sped away - he knew that something was up - so I followed him up and down the neighbourhood streets until he finally got on the highway. He was going 90 mph and I was right behind him. I thought, ""I can chase you all night, I got a full tank of gas.""  Eventually he pulled over. I yelled and screamed and accused him of cheating. He said, ""You shouldn't have hacked into my voicemail!"" and it went back and forth. He was so angry and started beating on the car and that scared me, so I decided that was it. Diane Reeve spoke to Jo Fidgen on Outlook on the BBC World Service You can listen again here We broke up on a Saturday. The following Monday I had a well-woman examination and when the results came back there were some anomalies in the cervical cells. They said it was human papilloma virus (HPV). I'd never had that before so I knew that he had given it to me. That shocked me and made me afraid - I had to have surgery to remove the abnormal cells and I didn't know if it would progress into cancer or not. I wondered if I should warn the other two women. I went back through the nine months' of Philippe's cellphone records that I had, trying to find them again. I would call numbers and whenever a woman answered, I would ask, ""Are you seeing Philippe Padieu?"" and if they said ""Yes,"" I would say, ""Well, I need to talk to you a little bit."" I found nine other women who were also seeing him that way. Some of them were angry, some of them hung up on me, some of them were very interested, and some of them were appreciative - I got all kinds of different responses. A lady who had been seeing Philippe, who lived close to him, was so angry that she and I decided to meet with another couple of women. We had quite an interesting lunch comparing notes and we took a picture of ourselves making an obscene gesture and sent it to him. There was another woman who I contacted later on. We met at a little jazz bar. She'd been seeing Philippe three times a week for about a-year-and-a-half.   She did not have an exclusive relationship with him, but she was waiting for that to happen, I think. I told her everything that had happened to me - how romantic things had been with us for years, how we were building a house together, how we were going to move in together but then broke up. I told her about the HPV and that I was continuing to have health problems.  She listened very intently to what I had to say.  I said, ""This is your decision and if you want to continue to see him then that's your business,"" and I thought that would be the last time we would talk. Three months later I got a call from the health department who said that I needed to come in for testing. I panicked because I had been having a lot of health problems in addition to the abnormal cervical smear. I had kept Philippe's phone in case somebody called and I could warn them too. I looked at it again after I was contacted by the health department and noticed that the last person to call it was the woman that I'd met at the jazz bar. I called her and I said, ""I just got a call from the health department, what can you tell me about this?""  She said four words that I will never forget: ""We need to talk."" She had continued to see Philippe after we'd met but she'd then decided to break it off. She'd started to worry about sexually transmitted diseases and had gone to get tested. Her doctor had called her and told her that there was bad news, she was living with HIV. At that point I just knew that everything that I had gone through over the last six months - the health problems, not having any energy, things that I had attributed to getting a little bit older - all these puzzle pieces fitted together and I knew what I was facing.  The next day I had an appointment with my gynaecologist and they took some blood. The following day they called me with the results. ""Diane, I'm sorry. It's positive."" I dropped the phone and fell to my knees. I thought I was going to die. I had not followed HIV closely - I remembered when there was no cure, and I knew that there was medicine now, but I didn't really know how effective it was. And I knew that I was really, really sick. That was January 2007. When I went for further testing I found out that I had Aids. That means that your immune system is damaged to the point that you are very vulnerable to illness. Your body just won't fight back because the virus has damaged the cells which fight off infection.   I had health insurance because I was self-employed; I had just changed policies about two months before I got the diagnosis. There was a disclaimer at the end of the policy which said, ""Please be aware that we do not cover HIV,"" which I had signed happily, because I knew I didn't have HIV. Except two months later I found out that I did. So I had insurance that did not pay for HIV and the medicine was about $2,000 (¬£1,500) a month and I couldn't afford it. Almost immediately after getting the results I went to counselling. I really needed some help to process things. I was terribly depressed, I was very fearful and I was homicidally angry. I decided to talk again to the woman I'd met at the jazz bar. We cried together, and we got angry together. When she had got her diagnosis she'd immediately called Philippe",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45889226,"Baby boxes are being promoted as a safe alternative to standard cots, bassinets and Moses baskets despite a lack of evidence on their safety, experts warn.  The cardboard boxes, which come with items like clothes and blankets and can be used as a bed, are offered to new mums in Scotland and parts of England. The Royal College of Midwives wants the scheme rolled out across the UK, saying it offers a ""more equal start to life"".  But experts have raised concerns about how safe the boxes are to sleep in. Writing in a letter to the BMJ, Prof Peter Blair and colleagues say that, as the evidence stands, the boxes should only be used as a temporary bed if nothing else is available. The boxes, which come with a mattress, have routinely been given to every expectant mother in Finland since the 1930s.  Scotland started offering the free boxes to new parents last year, while some NHS Trusts in England have had pilot and full schemes in place for up to two years. The boxes are not offered by health bodies in Wales or Northern Ireland. The Royal College of Midwives says the boxes can reduce the likelihood of babies sleeping unsafely, either on a surface like a sofa or with parents who smoke, drink alcohol, or take drugs, and would particularly benefit those born into deprived environments.  However, Prof Blair and colleagues, including representatives of the cot death charity Lullaby Trust, said there was a lack of evidence into how safe the boxes are for sleeping in. Compared with cots, bassinets and Moses baskets, it is harder for parents to see their babies easily when they are sleeping in them, they warned.  And some boxes, particularly those that are not laminated, may potentially be flammable or leave babies more vulnerable to pets and young siblings if they are kept on the floor. They are also too small for most babies older than three months and there is no evidence on how durable they are, particularly if they become wet or dirty.  Prof Blair, from the University of Bristol, told the BBC: ""One of the things we've been encouraging in the last 25 years is just a bit more closer contact, closer observation. Forget this idea of having infants in a separate room early on.  ""Always have the infant in a cot by the parental bed in that room. During day-time sleeps, if the infant wants a nap, try and have the parent in the same room as the infant while that's occurring.  ""It's just this idea of observation just in case they get into difficulties. Sometimes you might not be able to do anything about it, sometimes you can, that's what we've encouraged.""  Prof Blair said he thought baby boxes went ""slightly against that"" because they made it harder for parents to keep an eye on their sleeping babies.  Moses baskets, cots and bassinets are preferable to baby boxes and also have to meet recognised UK safety standards, he said. The experts also argue that there is no evidence the boxes have helped Finland achieve some of the lowest rates of cot death (sudden infant death syndrome or SIDS) in the world, as has sometimes been claimed.  SIDS rates are equally low in neighbouring countries, such as Sweden and Denmark, where boxes are not provided, they say. Prof Blair and colleagues say there should be more high-quality studies ""to better understand how families use the cardboard baby box, and its safety implications"". Responding to the letter, the Royal College of Midwives pointed out that its position statement on baby boxes had acknowledged that there was limited evidence around them reducing SIDS. It said that baby boxes needed to be safe, of high quality and the box and mattress should meet at least the minimum UK safety standards.  The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said: ""Whilst the evidence around the effectiveness of baby boxes is still being debated, what we do know is that they provide all parents with the essentials needed to give their newborn baby the best start in life.""  Source: NHS website ""We are getting ready to set up his cot but there is still room to grow in the box at the moment.  ""He feels secure with it being high-walled and it's soothing for him as it's stimula free once he's put to bed. ""We place it on top of a very solid, safe Ottoman next to the bed and against the wall, and I look down into the box and can monitor his safety.  ""I am so very pleased and grateful for the box."" ""We use it during the day downstairs but at night we have a Moses basket upstairs.  ""We will probably only use it for a couple more weeks as my average-sized five-week-old is getting a bit long for it.  ""I check it daily for signs of damage as my daughter has previously dribbled on the mattress whilst sleeping.  ""The mattress and mattress cover supplied with the box is washable and no wet has damaged the box.  ""I have two cats and three school-aged children and do not feel it puts my daughter any more at risk than leaving her in her Moses basket, pram, baby swing etc.""  Follow Alex on Twitter",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45734261,"The pressures on mental health services are well documented. But what is it like to try to negotiate the system to get the help you need? Figures revealed on Friday by the BBC show the flagship mental health Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service fails more people than it helps in one in seven areas of England. We spoke to two people with very different experiences of ""navigating the system"" and accessing mental health services. Karla says she knows she's been lucky. Her experience of accessing mental health care has been overwhelmingly positive. ""I've got two long-term health conditions but it was this year that it became a real issue. In January I did attempt suicide,"" she says. Karla, who lives in Derby, adds: ""I got CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) really quickly, within a couple of weeks. And in that time, I was seeing my GP pretty much every day. He made time to make sure I was OK. ""It doesn't happen very often that people have that experience. I was really fortunate to have a GP who took the time. The access can be such a problem."" And she says her CBT made a significant difference. ""The therapist helped me through a lot of things. I'm officially in recovery from depression and anxiety. I'm in a far better place. ""CBT has taught me how to express things in healthier ways. Now I don't bottle things up so much.  ""It gave me the strength to say, 'you know what, it's going to hurt and it's going to get worse'. Before, I didn't talk to anyone. Therapy taught me to accept this is what it is. ""It's given me my life back and the confidence to do things and try things - to know that when I failed it's not because I was a weak person. I am not. I get up every morning in chronic pain - sometimes getting up and getting dressed is a challenge. ""It's given me the confidence in myself that I need. It's saved my life."" Imran (not his real name) has had a very different experience to Karla, and - six years on from first seeking help for his mental health issues - he is still struggling to access effective ongoing support. During that time, he has had contact with a wide range of professionals - his GP, social workers and housing support staff - which ""didn't amount to anything"". He was also referred to a psychiatrist, and later CBT.  None of it has worked for him, and he says it can be hard to negotiate ""the system"" when you are also dealing with symptoms. ""There's a lot of pressure on you. It's really hard. ""If you miss an appointment, if you're not feeling really up for it - or you have a bad night, it's really hard to see someone. You feel lonely and isolated. And if something fails, you're in limbo. ""It's all really confusing; the different organisations, the medication, remembering all the different numbers and who to email and to call and to keep in contact with my GP. ""Better communication - between the different teams and with patients - would help a lot."" Imran says the wait for an appointment can be particularly difficult. ""When you've got a big issue about care, you don't really have that much time, you feel as if you're under pressure over making a decision. There needs to be  a better way."" Vicki Nash, head of policy and campaigns at the mental health charity Mind, said: ""In recent years, awareness of mental health has increased rapidly, and more and more people are asking for help when they are having problems, as they should.  ""That's a very good thing, but it relies on services across the country having the necessary investment behind them. Unfortunately, your likelihood of receiving the help you need can still vary depending on where you live, and this needs to change, urgently."" If you're affected by these issues, here are details of some organisations which offer support and advice BBC Action Line Mind Vicki says: ""If you're struggling to get an appointment to see a doctor, do persist. It's awful that so many people are struggling to access the support they need from their GPs when they need it. We know that there are many barriers to people seeking help from their GP in the first place, but on top of this we are concerned that problems with booking appointments may deter people further.  ""It's really important that people don't give up, as GPs are often the gatekeepers for accessing help and support. ""If you're worried about your mental health, but don't feel comfortable speaking to a GP, talk to someone you trust, such as a close friend or family member.""  She adds: ""Advocates can be a useful way of getting support when you feel that your concerns aren't being dealt with appropriately by health or social care professionals. ""It can be helpful in these situations to have someone backing you up, standing up for your rights and helping you to properly express your views and wishes. Advocates can be provided by a number of organisations, including local Mind branches.""",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45902794,"Doctors need to get better at having difficult conversations with dying patients and not just in their final days, according to a report from the Royal College of Physicians. It says doctors should talk to people who could die within 12 months, who may be frail or terminally ill, and give them choices over their future care. But the report says that rarely happens and doctors should be more proactive. It recommends involving family, friends and carers in the conversation too. The report, Talking about dying, gathered the views of patients, trainees and doctors on how to begin conversations about the end of someone's life. Although doctors say they find these types of conversations challenging, the report said it was important they didn't ""shy away"" from them. It said doctors in all areas of healthcare should engage with a patient who wanted to talk about dying. But it shouldn't be ""a one-off, tick-box event"". Linda Magistris set up a charity called the Good Grief Trust after her husband died from cancer.  She says she was shocked by the way he was told the end was close. ""They literally just said you've got weeks to live, and, sadly, it was done in an environment that wasn't private. ""There were five people around the bed, pagers were going off at the same time - it was very chaotic. ""That was a private moment and a really significant moment for him and it should have been done more sensitively."" One in three adults admitted to hospital with a serious illness or injury and 80% of care home residents are estimated to be in their last year of life.  The General Medical Council says patients should be considered to be approaching the end of their life if they: But only a quarter of patients in these categories are given the chance to discuss the end of their life with a doctor, the report says, and those with heart failure, dementia and frailty are much less likely to be identified. Nearly half of all deaths in England happen in hospital - and 25% of people who die there have been in hospital for more than a month. But surveys suggest hospitals are where communication about the end of life is poorest. The report suggests junior doctors don't get enough hands-on training talking about dying with real patients. Dr Victoria Tzortziou Brown, from the Royal College of GPs, said patients should feel reassured that GPs were ""highly-trained to have sensitive conversations"" with them and their families. She said: ""The entire relationship between GP and patient is based on good communication, and we have a unique role in the NHS of caring for our patients from when they are born to the end of their lives.   ""We are pleased that the report highlights this and hope it will help GPs and other healthcare professionals with their conversations on these important issues."" Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians London, said: ""This is not just about palliative care in the final days but about having a series of conversations much earlier after a terminal diagnosis."" Prof Dame Jane Dacre, the previous president of the RCP, said: ""Patients value and benefit from clear conversations about the end of life.

The public inquiry into the scandal is not due to look at financial support until 2020. Campaign group Tainted Blood said, at the current rate, 112 more people would die before the issue was resolved. The Cabinet Office said it ""will consider"" calls for improved support. Labour MP Diana Johnson - co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Haemophilia and Contaminated Blood - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""The state has harmed these people, and the state now needs to step up and compensate them properly."" A public inquiry opened last month looking into how thousands of people in the 1970s and 80s were given blood products infected with hepatitis viruses and HIV.  It is thought more than 2,400 people have died, while many others have been left in very poor health. Last week, inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff wrote to the Cabinet Office describing how some families had ""lost everything"" and ""had to live on the breadline"".  He asked the government to take ""decisive action"" to tackle the issue of financial compensation. The Cabinet Office has said it ""will consider"" the recommendations and ""respond as soon as possible"". Tainted Blood, the largest support group for victims, has now written to Health Secretary Matt Hancock asking the government to address what it says is an ""unacceptable delay"" in dealing with finances.  In the letter, seen by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, it calls for support payments in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to be increased to the level received by Scottish victims of the scandal.  ""I believe it will be a matter of deep and future shame for this government if it fails to act, and act quickly,"" said Andrew Evans, chairman of the group.  As it stands there are a number of complex financial support schemes running across the UK. Payments can range from under ¬£5,000 a year to more than ¬£36,000. In most cases, Scottish victims of the scandal and their families receive more than victims living in Wales, with those in Northern Ireland and England receiving the least. The campaign group says someone infected with both HIV and early-stage hepatitis C in Scotland can receive a lump sum of ¬£50,000 plus ¬£37,000 a year in support payments. In England a victim in a similar condition would receive around ¬£26,500 a year with no lump sum.  The widow of someone infected in a Scottish hospital can receive an annual support payment of ¬£27,250 compared with a single one-off payment of ¬£10,000 in England. The group is now asking asking for parity with the Scottish system, for payments to be backdated, and all widows' payments to be paid regardless of whether the victim has remarried or formed a civil partnership. Labour MP Diana Johnson said there was ""no reason at all why our government couldn't decide now, even though the public inquiry is under way, to say, 'Right, we're going to compensate these people and pay them properly'"". She said that as an interim measure, payments in other parts of the UK should be brought up to the same level as those in Scotland, but that she ""still [doesn't] think that's enough"". She said in ""many cases"" the lives of those affected had been ""destroyed"". Around 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with hepatitis viruses in the 1970s and 80s.  It is thought more than 1,250 were also infected with HIV. Nearly 3,000 of them have since died. They were injected with a treatment - either Factor VIII or IV - used to help their blood clot. But Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment and so supplies were imported from the US. Much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. Other victims who had blood transfusions after surgery were also exposed to contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s the blood products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this, and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991 and by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk.

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45932048,"One of the world's biggest tobacco firms, Philip Morris, has been accused of ""staggering hypocrisy"" over its new ad campaign that urges smokers to quit. The Marlboro maker said the move was ""an important next step"" in its aim to ""ultimately stop selling cigarettes"".  But Cancer Research UK said the firm was just trying to promote its smoking alternatives, such as heated tobacco. ""This is a staggering hypocrisy,"" it said, pointing out the firm still promotes smoking outside the UK.  ""The best way Philip Morris could help people to stop smoking is to stop making cigarettes,"" George Butterworth, Cancer Research UK's tobacco policy manager said.  The charity said smoking was the leading preventable cause of cancer and it encouraged people to switch away completely from smoking, including through the use of e-cigarettes. Health charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) also criticised the campaign - which is called Hold My Light and has been launched in a four-page wraparound on Monday's Daily Mirror - saying it was a way for Philip Morris to get around the UK's anti-tobacco advertising rules. There is also a campaign video, which shows a young woman negotiating a Mission Impossible-style room in order to hand her cigarette lighter over to a group of friends, who are supporting her in a bid to give up smoking.   Most forms of tobacco advertising and promotion in the UK are banned, and rules introduced last year mean cigarettes and tobacco must be sold in plain green packets. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said Philip Morris was still advertising its Marlboro brand wherever globally it was legal to do so.  ""The fact of the matter is that it can no longer do that in the UK, we're a dark market where all advertising, promotion and sponsorship is banned, and cigarettes are in plain packs.  ""So instead Philip Morris is promoting the company name which is inextricably linked with Marlboro,"" she said. Philip Morris has said previously that it wants to achieve a ""smoke-free"" future.  Like many tobacco firms, Philip Morris is moving towards a focus on new products to replace cigarettes as the number of smokers in the UK continues to decline.  In the UK, it markets several alternatives to cigarettes, including a heated tobacco product, Iqos.   It also owns the Nicocig, Vivid and Mesh e-cigarette brands.   The firm's managing director Peter Nixon said its new advertising campaign was ""about supporting smokers in finding alternatives"".  Asked why, if Philip Morris was so keen for smokers to quit, it did not simply stop making cigarettes and focus entirely on alternative products, he said it was because smokers would just switch to a rival product.   ""Cigarettes still generate 87% of our business. We want to get to [smoke-free] as soon as possible, and we want to be selling alternatives, but it does take time,"" he said.  Mr Nixon said the firm had invested over ¬£4bn in developing alternative products to cigarettes. The campaign suggests four ways to give up cigarettes, including going cold turkey, using nicotine patches, vaping and using heated tobacco products. In an unusual move, the Daily Mirror made a reference in its editorial column to the advertising feature which envelops the paper. It said it was ""pleased to back the campaign"". It added: ""Yes, we were surprised too that this is a campaign created by Philip Morris Ltd. But it can only be a good thing that they are now trying to encourage people to quit cigarettes."" In July last year, the government set out a plan to make England, in effect, smoke-free in the next few decades.  The new Tobacco Control Plan aimed to cut smoking rates from 15.5% to 12% of the population by 2022.",,,,

Women who received palbociclib and hormone therapy lived up to 10 months longer than those given hormone treatment alone. It also delayed the time at which women needed to begin chemotherapy, which often has debilitating side-effects.  Experts say the preliminary results of the trial are very encouraging.  But they point out that the treatment is not a cure and will not work for everyone.  The placebo-controlled clinical trial tested the benefit of adding palbociclib to the hormone therapy fulvestrant in a trial of 521 women with advanced, oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancer whose tumours did not have the HER2 gene. Oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancers are the most common form of breast cancer, accounting for about 70% of cases.  The study, led by researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, examined what effect palbociclib had on women's overall survival and whether it could delay the need for chemotherapy. The analysis found that in women whose tumours had previously responded well to hormone therapy (410 of the 521 women), the treatment extended survival by 10 months to an average of 39.7 months, compared with 29.7 months in the women who received fulvestrant and a dummy pill (placebo). However, the treatment did not extend survival in those who had previously not responded well to hormone therapy.  Three years after they were enrolled in the study, 49.6% of women who received both palbociclib and fulvestrant were still alive, compared with 40.8% of women who were treated with fulvestrant alone.  The group of women given the combination treatment also had a nine-month longer delay until the start of chemotherapy. Prof Nicholas Turner, who led the study, said: ""The development of palbociclib is one of the biggest advances in treatment for women with advanced breast cancer in the last two decades. ""This drug can offer women more precious time with their loved ones, and because it is a targeted treatment it is much kinder than chemotherapy, and enables many women to carry on with their lives normally."" Palbociclib was approved for use in England by NICE in November 2017, but currently is only available for women with oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who were diagnosed after the disease had begun to spread. The authors of this new study want it to also be made available to women whose breast cancer has previously been treated with hormone therapy. Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said the results were ""very encouraging"".   ""Although the treatment gave some people with breast cancer precious extra months, it's not a cure, and won't work for everyone.  ""So we need to understand more about breast cancer's weak spots and exploit them to develop even more effective treatments in the future."" Delyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said the results were ""exciting"" but more research was needed.   Lady Morgan said it was important for NICE to reform its method of appraising combination therapies so that breast cancer patients could benefit from the palbociclib and fulvestrant treatment.   The study has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine and was presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology congress in Munich, Germany. Follow Alex on Twitter.",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45938808,"Salmonella food poisoning is normally something that people associate with undercooked chicken or eggs.  But The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is reminding the public that eating some types of ""pink"" lamb or mutton can also pose a risk.  Since June, 165 people in England have become ill with Salmonella typhimurium bacteria traced back to meat from affected sheep.  Lamb chops and steaks are fine to have pink, but mince isn't, says the FSA. Salmonella typhimurium is one of a group of bacteria that typically live in animal intestines and are shed through faeces.  People can become infected through contaminated water or food and may experience ""tummy bug"" symptoms - nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps.  They can also spread it to other people, although keeping good hygiene by washing your hands after using the toilet and before handling food can minimise this risk.  The FSA says people can still safely eat lamb and mutton. But consumers should be aware of the potential risk of eating it when it is not cooked correctly.   Cooking food at the right temperature and for the correct length of time will ensure that any harmful bacteria are killed. Always check the advice on food packaging and follow the cooking instructions provided. It depends on how the lamb or mutton has been prepared.  A rare, or pink, lamb chop that has been seared well on the outside should be fine because any bacteria on the outer surface will have been killed by the heat.  But minced or diced lamb or mutton should never be served pink. It needs to be thoroughly cooked and browned.  The same goes for burgers. When meat is minced to make a burger, any harmful bacteria from the surface of the meat can get spread throughout the burger. As a result, rare and undercooked burgers can have harmful bacteria on the inside and may cause food poisoning if not fully cooked. Source: NHS",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45939593,"More than a quarter of meat-free burgers, sausages and mince tested for a study exceed maximum recommended salt levels, a campaign group has warned. A total of 28% of the 157 meat substitute products studied by Action on Salt missed the voluntary salt targets set by Public Health England. The worst offenders were saltier than Atlantic seawater, the report found. Public Health England said it had told companies the importance of meeting its voluntary targets. But Action on Salt called on PHE to take ""urgent action"" to do more to lower salt in the products. Of all of the meat-free alternatives studied by Action on Salt, only three were low in salt. The saltiest product was Tofurky's Deli Slices Hickory Smoked, followed by Tesco's Meat Free Bacon Style Rashers - with 3.5g and 3.2g of salt per 100g respectively.  PHE's target for meat-free bacon is 1.88g of salt per 100g. Seawater has 2.5g of salt per 100g. Meat-free bacon was found to be the saltiest range of products, followed by sliced ""meat"", while vegetarian burgers were saltier on average than those containing meat. There were also large variations between products in the same category, with the biggest being the 83% between the saltiest and least salty meat-free mince products. Tesco's Meat Free Mince had one of the lowest levels of salt of all the 157 products analysed. Tofurky and Tesco have yet to respond to a request to comment on the findings. Action on Salt nutritionist Mhairi Brown said: ""The food industry has ensured greater availability of meat-free alternatives, but now they must do more to ensure that meat-free alternatives contain far less salt - at the very least lower than their meat equivalents. ""This survey drives home the urgent need for Public Health England to reinvigorate the UK's salt reduction strategy."" Action on Salt chairman Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at London's Queen Mary University, said: ""Reducing salt is the most cost-effective measure to reduce the number of people dying or suffering from entirely unnecessary strokes and heart disease."" He added: ""It is incomprehensible that Public Health England are not doing more to reduce the amount of salt in our food. We are again calling on PHE to take urgent action"". Prof Louis Levy, head of nutrition science at Public Health England, said salt consumption had fallen over the last decade ""but there is still a long way to go, as some foods still contain too much salt"". He added: ""Government has been clear with the food industry on the importance of meeting the 2017 salt targets.  ""Since taking over salt reduction, PHE has been collecting data on industry's progress and we'll report later this year as planned."" Quorn, one of the leading producers of vegetarian meat, said it had varying levels of salt in its products. Its Meat-Free Best of British Sausages contain 1.9g of salt per 100g - more than the PHE recommendation. That means eating one sausage will give you 1.1g of salt. Adults would need to eat more than six of them in a day to bust their salt allowance (not counting any other salt in foods they also eat).  A spokeswoman added: ""While they are higher in salt, as clearly marked on the pack, they are still low in saturated fat.  ""We review all our product recipes on an ongoing basis to ensure we are achieving what our consumers want in terms of taste and health credentials.""",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45593583,"About three million women across England have not had a smear test for at least three-and-a-half years. GPs are trying to improve take-up rates as figures show up to half of women under 50 in some areas have not had a cervical screening in the recommended time frame. Screening rates are at their lowest for two decades. Public Health England said it was ""concerned"" by the fall. A further million women aged 50 to 64 have not had a smear test for at least five and a half years. About 72% of women aged 25 to 64 have had a smear test within the period recommended for their age, according to figures compiled in March 2017. This is down from 75.4% in 2012. A total of 220,000 British women are diagnosed with cervical abnormalities each year and there were 854 deaths from cervical cancer in England in 2016. Cervical screening detects abnormal cells on the entrance to the womb. Samme Allen, from Kingston, says the manner of a nurse at a cervical screening she had aged 25 was ""the opposite of reassuring"". It was 10 years before she had another one and the result led to a diagnosis of cervical cancer. She had to undergo ""a couple of operations"" and has subsequently been given the all clear. ""I worked overseas and regularly moved, so I always seemed to avoid thinking about it,"" she said. ""I never had any symptoms for cervical cancer, and so didn't feel I needed to go to the doctor."" This continued for a decade until a nurse at a routine health check in 2010 told her she was overdue a screening. Business consultant Ms Allen said the test should be seen in a similar way to ""going to the dentist or opticians"". ""Yes, it's uncomfortable and no it's not a pleasant experience, but my story shows how important it really is,"" she said. The NHS target is for 80% of women aged 25 to 49 to be tested every three years and the same proportion aged 50 to 64 to be screened every five years. WATCH: Is there scraping in a smear test? The truth about what it really involves  London has some of the lowest rates of women screened for cervical cancer. In some boroughs just over half of eligible women under 50 had a test within the past three and a half years. Official figures from Public Health England (PHE), matched to local authority districts, reveal about half of eligible 25 to 49-year-old women registered at GP practices in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Camden and Hammersmith and Fulham had received adequate screening. Cambridge and Oxford also had rates of 54 and 55%. In Leicester it was 60%, rising to 61% in Luton and 62% in Manchester, Slough, Haringey and Birmingham. Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire was at the other end, with 80% of eligible women having had the test in the past three-and-a-half years. A spokeswoman for Rushcliffe CCG said practices in the Nottinghamshire area deemed not to be achieving screening targets were given extra support. She said Cancer Research UK had been helping to improve uptake. Experts put it down to embarrassment, a lack of awareness or just putting it off.  A survey of 2,017 women by the charity Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust suggested young women were embarrassed to attend smear tests because of their body shape (35%), the appearance of their vulva (34%) and concerns over smell (38%). A third said they would not go if they had not waxed or shaved their bikini area. About 15% said they would miss their smear tests for a gym class or a waxing appointment. Dr Laura Marlow from University College London conducted research into cervical cancer screenings and said ethnicity also played ""an important role"". ""We found that women from ethnic minority groups were more likely to be unaware of screening and older women were more likely to have decided not to go,"" she said.  ""Understanding these patterns will help us to decide how interventions might be shaped differently for different types of non-attenders."" However, she added: ""I think we have to be careful about saying that ethnicity contributes to the absolute numbers because it is only a part of the picture."" A spokeswoman for clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in north west London said GPs faced challenges in areas with ""language barriers, religious concerns and high levels of deprivation"". Cervical screening rates rose following the death of realty TV star Jade Goody at the age of 27 in 2009, as her story brought about greater awareness, but the numbers have fallen back since. Dr Asha Kasliwal, president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, said: ""Cervical screening is not a mandated requirement for local authority commissioning. Local authorities under severe budgetary pressure are not including this essential aspect of women's health care in their service specifications. ""GPs have a very positive role to play in increasing uptake by offering opportunistic screening, but primary care is not able to effectively meet the increased demand. ""Screening rates are now at their lowest in two decades and the minimum 80% national target is far from being achieved,"" she said. Dr Kasliwal is calling for resources and more funding for cervical screening in primary healthcare, and for it to be included in sexual health services. Women in north-west London women are being offered evening and weekend screenings in order to make it more convenient to attend. Robert Music from Jo's Cancer Trust said there was ""no one magic solution"" to improve attendance, but the charity was working with GPs to provide drop in surgeries, phone clinics and ""engagement with community or faith groups"". Professor Anne Mackie, PHE's director of screening said: ""PHE, alongside charities including Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, the NHS and local authorities, are concerned about the fall in women taking the test.  ""Currently 72% of women have cervical screening and we're working together to ensure that every woman knows what the test is about and to make it easy to attend screening appointments.""",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45878325,"Obesity is often portrayed as a Western problem, with under-nutrition found in poorer countries. But the truth is more complex. Nine out of 10 countries are in the grip of a health epidemic known as the ""double burden"" - where overweight and undernourished people live side-by-side.  A worldwide explosion in the availability of unhealthy foods, a shift towards office jobs and the growth of transport and television are among the many causes. Often, this double burden occurs not only within a community, but also within the same family.  It can even happen within the same person, who is overweight but lacking in vital nutrients. Alternatively, they can be part of a phenomenon known as ""thin-fat"", where people appear to be a healthy weight, but carry large amounts of hidden fat. Every country in the world is struggling with a nutrition problem of some kind.  The number of people suffering from chronic food deprivation reached an estimated 815m in 2016 - a 5% increase in two years. Much of the increase was in Africa, where 20% of people were malnourished. Meanwhile, obesity rates have tripled over the last 40 years. Globally, more than 600m adults are obese, while 1.9bn are overweight.  The number of obese people in developing countries is catching up with the developed world.  The highest rates of childhood obesity can be found in Micronesia, the Middle East and the Caribbean. And since 2000 the number of obese children in Africa has doubled. In many places it is common to find children whose diet does not meet their needs. In South Africa, almost one in three boys are overweight or obese, while a further third are underweight.  In Brazil, 36% of girls are overweight or obese, while 16% are classed as underweight. Lifestyle changes are partly to blame for the double burden of obesity and under-nourishment. Many low and middle-income countries, such as India and Brazil, have a new middle class with disposable income, rather than just the money to spend on essentials. Often, this has meant a move away from traditional foods towards more Western diets high in sugars, fats and meat, and low in unrefined grains and beans. In some countries this has also happened as people move from the countryside to the city, where there is much more choice of food. For example, a study of young children in China suggested that in the countryside, obesity rates were 10%, while the malnutrition rate was 21%. In cities, 17% of children were obese while 14% were malnourished.  Although many people's diets may be higher in calories, they can still offer too few vitamins and minerals. Professor Ranjan Yajnik, a diabetes specialist in Pune, India, is seeing first-hand one impact this change of diets is having.  ""Diabetes was considered a disease of the older and more obese,"" he says. ""But in India we're seeing it in younger people and with a lower BMI."" Indians are eating fewer nutrient-rich foods and getting more calories from junk food, he says, resulting in the problem of thin-fat - ""people who are thin by most criteria are actually carrying large amounts of hidden fat"".  Hidden, or visceral fat, accumulates around internal organs, including the liver. High levels of visceral fat may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, even if the carrier doesn't look overweight. Children are particularly vulnerable to unhealthy diets, as they need vitamins and minerals in order to grow and develop normally. Some households contain children who are undernourished, even as they eat the same diet as their obese parents, because they are deficient in vitamins.   Research also suggests stunted or malnourished children are more likely to become overweight later in life, as their metabolism slows and their body hangs on to fat reserves.  This means countries need to be careful that policies aimed at tackling hunger do not accidentally add to the problem of over-nutrition.  In Chile during the 1920s, a national programme was introduced to provide rations to pregnant women and the under-sixes. This reduced hunger but in the long-term is thought to have contributed to Chile's rapidly rising rates of childhood obesity. While the double burden may be particularly prevalent in developing countries, the problem is also found in richer nations. In the UK, for example, more than a quarter of adults are obese, costing the NHS an estimated ¬£5.1bn each year.  At the same time, 3.7m children live in households which cannot afford to follow healthy dietary guidelines, with one in 10 living with severe food insecurity. In the European Union, 14% of 15-19 year-olds are underweight, and a similar proportion are overweight or obese. However, more than half of over-18s are overweight or obese, while just 2% are underweight.  The causes of this double burden are complicated. It is not only a question of having access to healthy foods, and no two people or cultures view nutrition in the same way. Our food choices are influenced by many things, some of which we may not be aware of. They include cost, local availability, time pressures, healthily eating knowledge and the diets of people around us.  And every person's nutritional needs are different. This partly depends upon their metabolism and how good their health was to start off with.  The cost to the individual and society of over and under-nutrition are numerous. Children who grow up undernourished often do worse in school and earn less throughout their life.   Childhood obesity is likely to lead to poorer health in adulthood, and increases the risk of diseases like cancer later on. Malnutrition is a particular risk for older people - making them twice as likely to visit their doctor and at risk of longer hospital stays. In developing countries, problems like diabetes and heart disease are likely to soar in tandem with obesity rates. For health systems which have traditionally focused on infectious diseases such as malaria and have small budgets, this will be a huge challenge.  What can be done? South America - where many countries suffer from the double burden - is leading the way. Brazil was the first country to sign up to the UN's Decade of Action on Nutrition, making many commitments. These include halting the growth in obesity, cutting consumption of sugary drinks by 30% and increasing fruit and vegetable intake by 18%. It aims to achieve these with policies such as microloans to farmers, reducing tax on certain fresh foods and educating children on nutrition. Mexico was the first country to implement a 'sugar tax', imposing a 10% levy on artificially sweetened drinks in 2014.  This tax is predicted to reduce obesity rates by 12.5% in 12 years, and other countries such as the UK are now adopting similar measures.  But much more is needed in order to halt this global nutrition crisis. About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.

The operations - which are the first ever of their kind in the UK - were carried out by a team of 30 doctors at University College Hospital in London. The babies had spina bifida, a condition when the spinal cord fails to develop properly and has a gap in it. It is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility. During the 90-minute surgery carried out this summer, doctors cut an opening in the womb and then stitched together the baby's gap in the spine. The procedure is risky and can cause premature labour, but researchers are exploring less invasive keyhole methods. ""We put the mum on some drugs that help relax them, but there is still a risk,"" said UCL Professor Anne David, who has worked on bringing the surgery to the UK for three years. Mums and babies are recovering well, the hospital said.  Mothers previously had to go abroad to the US, Belgium or Switzerland for the operation. ""It's fantastic,"" said Prof David. ""Women now don't have to travel out of the UK. They can have their family with them. There are less expenses. So all good things."" According to the charity Shine, more than 200 children are born with spina bifida every year.  The NHS says the condition happens when the baby's neural tube - an early form of the baby's brain and spinal cord - does not form properly and leads to gaps or defects in the spinal cord and bones of the spine. Surgery can be used to close the gap in the spine in most cases, but often the nervous system will already have been damaged leading to problems including paralysis of the legs and incontinence. Some people with the condition have learning difficulties. It is not known what causes the condition, which develops during pregnancy, but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk. The surgery, which follows a trial in the US, will be available for patients through the new Centre for Prenatal Therapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital and UCL hospital. ""There were some children who had grown up following foetal surgery who were walking and you wouldn't expect them to be walking if they hadn't had it,"" said Prof David, of the recent US study.",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45953442,"Taller people are at more risk of getting cancer, a new study looking at over a million people claims.  Past reports have reached the same conclusion, but should lofty people be alarmed, or is this just a tall story?  Experts stress the results only point to a very small increase in risk compared with factors like smoking.  Plus it is unclear what might be the driver behind the link. The leading theory is tall people have more cells that can turn cancerous. But hormone levels, other illnesses and how affluent or deprived people are when young, might have an impact on height and cancer risk too.  Report author Dr Leonard Nunney told the BBC a person's risk factor depended on their exact height. ""If 50/500 average height women got cancer then 60/500 tall (178cm) women would be expected to get cancer. If you consider a very tall woman, say 6'2"" (188cm), then you'd expect 67/500."" He added: ""The effect of smoking is massive. Even a light smoker (about three per day) has a huge six times increase in lung cancer risk ie: 50/500 becomes 300/500.""  The report, published by the Royal Society, says that for every 4in (10cm) increase in human height above the average used in the study of 5ft 7in for men and 5ft 3in for women, there is a 10% greater risk of that person getting cancer. The data was compiled from four large-scale studies, including the Million Women Study, on 23 cancer types in the UK, US, South Korea, Austria, Norway and Sweden. Each study chosen had to include 10,000 cancer cases for each sex. Of 18 cancer types analysed in both men and women, four - pancreas, oesophagus, stomach and mouth/pharynx - showed no apparent increase with height. And in the sex-specific cancers, only one - cervix - was unaffected. Height is only one of many factors that determine a person's cancer risk and it's definitely not a big one. Plus it can't be modified, unlike lifestyle risk factors, such as body weight.  Experts say that the key to increasing chances of avoiding illness is living a healthy lifestyle. Georgina Hill, from Cancer Research UK, told the BBC: ""The increased risk is small and there's plenty you can do to reduce the risk of developing cancer such as not smoking and keeping a healthy weight.""  Dr John O'Neill, research group leader, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), said: ""If you have more cells, you have a greater risk of cancer. Tall people have a greater surface area, and therefore more melanocytes, and so of course they're more likely to get melanoma."" Prof Andrew Sharrocks, professor of molecular biology, University of Manchester, said: ""Extrapolating from a height correlation to increased cell number being the reason for higher cancer incidence is a big leap and is only one possible explanation.  ""Similarly, saying that the higher incidence is due to a higher proliferation rate is also dubious, given the fact that most cancers arise much later in life, long after the increased proliferation associated with enhanced growth during childhood and adolescence has ceased."" This report follows on from a 2011 one from the University of Oxford and a similar study in Sweden in 2015. Prof Tim Cole, a professor of medical statistics at University College London, said tall people should not be too worried about any of the findings. ""Being tall has quite a lot of benefits, so having one minus factor is not too disastrous,"" he told the BBC. ""There are actually lots of status benefits for tall people. People who earn more money tend to be taller and world leaders tend to be taller, so things stack up in their favour."" Stuart Logan, a director of the UK's Tall Persons Club, feels that researchers tackle their studies in the wrong way. His club, which was founded in 1991, has around 250 members in the UK and Ireland, as well as some in other European countries. ""We've noticed that a lot of men are averaging around 6ft 3in or 6ft 4in and women around 5ft 10in or 5ft 11in,"" Mr Logan told the BBC. ""So it would be more useful if researchers contacted different associations like ourselves and used our members to produce their reports. ""Reports like this are unhelpful - they may produce better headlines but those are not backed up by the data included. ""What slightly annoys me is that on the positive side, the taller you are the less chance you have of diabetes, stroke or heart disease - but then you are told you have more risk of getting cancer.""",,,,

His doctors now say they left him needing an urgent liver transplant, writes the BBC's Tristan Quinn. It should have been one of the happiest days of his life. But Jim McCants looks back on his youngest son's high school graduation with mixed emotions. As he sat down next to his wife Cathleen in the university auditorium, just outside Dallas, Texas, she turned to look at him.  ""She said 'Do you feel OK?'"" Jim recalls. ""I said, 'Yeah I feel fine, why?' 'Your face is yellow, your eyes are yellow, you look terrible.' When I looked in the mirror it was shocking.""  It was shocking partly because Jim, then 50, had been working on improving his lifestyle and losing weight, focusing on eating more healthily and taking regular exercise. ""My dad had a heart attack at aged 59 and he did not make it,"" says Jim. ""There's a lot that he missed out on with us and I was determined to do what I can to take care of myself as best I can, so that I don't miss out."" But soon after his son's graduation, Jim was admitted to hospital with a suspected liver injury.  Trying to identify the cause of Jim's liver injury, those treating him ruled out alcohol. ""For the last 30 years I drank maybe a six-pack of beer a year, no wine. So alcohol was not a big part of my life,"" Jim says.  They also ruled out prescription drugs - he wasn't taking any at the time - and smoking, something he had never done.  ""Then my hepatologist drilled in to, 'What about any over-the-counter supplements?'"" says Jim. Watch the BBC Two Horizon programme Vitamin pills: Miracle or Myth? online (UK viewers only) BBC Food: Can a vitamin pill a day keep the doctor away? As part of his mid-life health kick, Jim had started taking a green tea supplement because he had heard it might have cardiac benefits. These supplements have grown in popularity in recent years, often breathlessly promoted online for their antioxidant benefits, and their supposed ability to aid weight loss and prevent cancer. ""I felt fine then,"" remembers Jim, who lives in Prosper, north of Dallas. ""I was walking or running 30-to-60 minutes, five or six days a week."" He was working as a finance manager but hoped to retrain as a physician assistant. ""I was taking two or three classes at a time at nights and at weekends,"" he recalls.  He had been taking the green tea supplement for two to three months when he became ill. According to Jim's medical record this is the presumed cause of his liver injury. ""It was shocking because I'd only heard about the benefits,"" remembers Jim. ""I'd not heard about any problems."" After his admission to hospital, Jim went into a ""holding pattern"", waiting for the results of a series of blood tests to establish the seriousness of his liver injury. Then, about three weeks after his wife had first noticed he looked ill, one of his liver doctors delivered the news he had been fearing: ""She said you need a liver transplant. This has to happen fast. You have days - you don't have a week.""  Jim was stunned. ""I was thinking this looks very bleak for me. It really crystallises what's important in life. I wasn't there thinking about projects at work. I was thinking of different people that were important to me for different reasons.""  What is it about green tea supplements that might cause harm at certain doses to some people? Scientists do not know for certain. Because green tea has been drunk for thousands of years, supplements consisting of its concentrated form are regulated in the US and Europe as foods, not medicines. That means that specific safety testing has not been required, so the scientific picture of how green tea supplements might affect our health is incomplete. ""If you are drinking modest amounts of green tea you're very safe,"" says Prof Herbert Bonkovsky, director of liver services at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina, who has been tracking injuries linked to green tea supplements for nearly 20 years. ""The greater risk comes in people who are taking these more concentrated extracts.""  Concern has focused on a potentially toxic ingredient called Epigallocatechin-3-gallate or EGCG, the most abundant of the naturally occurring compounds with antioxidant properties in green tea, called catechins. There are likely to be a number of factors that might make an individual susceptible to harm from EGCG including genetics, and the way supplements are used.  ""Usually people are taking these green tea extracts trying to lose weight, so they're often not eating,"" Dr Bonkovsky explains. ""We know from animal studies that fasted animals absorb a much higher percentage of the catechins than do fat animals. There may well be other factors of other drugs, other chemicals, use of alcohol that are also important as modifying factors."" Antioxidants are a group of vitamins and other compounds that for many have taken on miraculous properties, helping to drive the global market for supplements of all kinds, now worth more than ¬£100bn per year. Antioxidants ward off ""free radicals"", molecules produced in our cells as they turn oxygen and food into energy. Just as oxygen and water corrode iron, too many free radicals can damage our cells. In the 1950s, Prof Denham Harman theorised that free radicals drove the process by which the body ages and could lead to disease. But some scientists now believe that free radicals at certain levels may be beneficial for human health, and argue that the orthodox view of the last half century that antioxidants are an unalloyed good is outdated. While millions of people take green tea supplements safely, at least 80 cases of liver injury linked to green tea supplements have been reported around the world, ranging from lassitude and jaundice to cases requiring liver transplants. Those harmed after taking green tea pills have included teenagers, like 17-year-old Madeline Papineau from Ontario, Canada who developed liver and kidney injury, and an 81-year-old woman diagnosed with toxic acute hepatitis. A recent investigation by the European Food Safety Authority into the safety of green tea concluded that catechins from green tea drinks are ""generally safe"", but when taken as supplements catechin doses at or above 800mg per day ""may pose health concerns"". The EFSA could not identify a safe dose on the basis of available data and called for more research to be carried out.   The day after Jim was told he needed a liver transplant, amazingly he was told a suitable liver had been found. ""I was elated. The phone call that there was a match gave me hope that there would be something positive on the other side of this for me,"" he says. The liver transplant saved Jim's life. But four years later he still has serious health problems including kidney disease that may require dialysis and a transplant in the future. He sees his liver and kidney doctors twice a year, and lives with chronic abdominal pain. ""My life before was pretty active. And now it's much more sedentary and I struggle with fatigue,"" he says.  It's a ""tremendous blessing"", as he puts it, that his managers allow him to work from home. ""I may need a lie down for 20 or 30 minutes during the day. I'm able to just let my manager know I'm going offline, I'll be back."" Jim is pursuing a lawsuit against the American firm Vitacost, which sold the green tea supplement he took. ""I'm hoping that they make the decision to put a very strong warning label on the product, on the website, let people know before they buy it,"" he says.  Vitacost did not want to comment on the legal case, but said: ""We take the safety of our Vitacost brand supplements very seriously and stand behind the quality of our products.""   Four years on, Jim reflects on how his life and that of his family changed after he took a green tea supplement. ""I didn't expect harm. I expected that I might waste my money, I may take these and they don't do a bit of good. I can accept that risk,"" he says. ""But the risk that it could cause my liver to fail, that's a risk that's too high for somebody to take.""  British army officer Naima Houder-Mohammed paid thousands of dollars to the fat",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45942094,"The humble fruit fly could help scientists unlock the secrets of Alzheimer's disease. A new ¬£20m Dementia Research Institute at Cardiff University includes a fly laboratory. Researchers will be studying the brains of the flies because they share a large proportion of their genes with humans. They also have a ¬£1m microscope to hand, which is able to carry out thousands of tests on cells and collect data automatically. In Wales, there are 45,000 people living with dementia but this is set to increase to 100,000 by 2055. Cardiff is part of a new ¬£290m network of dementia research centres, which includes Cambridge, Edinburgh and London, looking to find a cure. The fruit fly has a part to play because it has many genes which are similar to those in Alzheimer's disease in humans. Its brain - roughly the size of a poppy seed - contains about 100,000 neurons; human brains have 100 billion. But only having a life cycle of a few months, scientists can track how the fly's brain ages far more quickly.  Dr Owen Peters, a lecturer and one of the researchers, said the flies can help us understand brain function. ""Flies allow us to do imaging techniques which we aren't able to do in other model systems,"" he said.  ""If we find a gene in the human genetic studies that looks like it's linked to Alzheimer's disease - and flies have it - it allows us to have a very rapid, inexpensive system, which we can test to see how these affect brain function.""  Fruit flies are just a small part of the genetic research which is looking to understand better how a family of diseases, which also includes  Parkinson's and Huntingdon's, behave.  Genetic studies have suggested that the body's own defence system could contribute to Alzheimer's disease. In normal circumstances - for example when a baby's brain is developing -  the body's own response serves an important purpose -  helping to ""prune"" the brain  of ""rubbish"" and get rid of ""redundant"" tissue that's damaged or died. However it's thought in diseases like Alzheimer's that response somehow could be damaging healthy cells Paul Morgan, professor of immunology, will be trying to try to develop a better understanding about those mechanisms ""We know now what we thought of as brain-rot, a slow decay of the brain in people with dementia - isn't that at all. Instead it's an inflammatory disease where the inflammation is driving the destruction of brain cells,"" said Prof Morgan.  ""And knowing that give us new approaches to therapy because were good at treating inflammation in other diseases like arthritis and we can now start thinking of applying those approaches to brain diseases like Alzheimer's.""  Prof Julie Williams, associate director of the institute, said with a team of more than 70 scientists in Cardiff and collaboration within the network, she believes it marks a ""step change"" in the way this set of diseases is studied. ""There are thousands of genes which will affect our susceptibility to develop these diseases so we can now capture most of that information so can indentify people who will be at a very high risk of developing the disease in the future,"" said Prof Williams.  ""That will allow us by using samples to create cell models - mini-brains based on stem cells which we can grow and to mould into different tissues - so we can model the disease in a way we've not been able to do in the past."" The Welsh Government is funding a ¬£1m robotic microscope - made in Llantrisant - which is able to scan and analyse thousands of individual cells at high speed.  Health Secretary Vaughan Gething, officially opening the institute, said the investment ""demonstrates our commitment to tackling this devastating disease and forms part of our plan to make Wales a dementia-friendly nation, as set out in our Dementia Action Plan.""",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45968005,"Adding a recording of a mother's voice to smoke alarms could save lives, according to US scientists. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found the modified alarms were more effective at waking children than conventional alarms.  And they had the potential to buy vital seconds to escape a burning building.  Fire chiefs welcomed the research, but said families should not worry about the alarms currently in their homes.  The research team at the Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio said children were ""remarkably resistant"" to being woken up by sounds because they have longer and deeper sleep than adults. The study compared a traditional high-pitch smoke alarm with voice-based ones. There were 176 children who took part, and alarms were personalised with a recording of the mother's voice instructing their child to wake up.  Only half woke up to the blaring noise of a conventional smoke alarm. But nine in 10 woke up to the voice alarms.   The experiments were performed in a sleep laboratory, and the alarms were played once the children were in the deepest phase of sleep.  Dr Mark Splaingard, one of the researchers, said: ""The fact that we were able to find a smoke alarm sound that reduces the amount of time it takes for many children five to 12 years of age to wake up and leave the bedroom, could save lives."" The researchers now want to test whether any voice will do, or if it has to be the mother. And they want to assess what impact such alarms might have on waking up adults.  Rick Hylton, from the UK's National Fire Chiefs Council, said he was looking forward to seeing how the research panned out. He said: ""People shouldn't be concerned about the effectiveness of their current smoke alarms. ""We know smoke alarms save lives so we ask that people ensure they have installed smoke alarms.  ""They will alert occupants early if working, fitted and installed in the correct location. This gives adults, parents or guardians the opportunity to wake children, and leave the house.""",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45983320,"Scientists say they have engineered a new antibiotic that appears promising in early clinical trials.  The drug, made by Shionogi Inc, acts like the Trojan horse in Greek legend to trick bacteria into allowing it to enter.  Trials on 448 people with a kidney or urinary tract infection suggested the drug was as effective as current treatments. Experts said the findings were an encouraging development. The drug takes inspiration from the story of the giant wooden horse which was used to sneak Greek warriors into the city of Troy. But instead of wood, iron is used to smuggle an antibiotic into bacteria.  Dr Simon Portsmouth, who led the international research, said: ""During an acute infection, one of our innate immune responses is to create an iron-poor environment.  ""In response, bacteria increase their iron intake."" The new antibiotic, cefiderocol, binds to iron and, in a deadly mistake, bacteria transport it past their defences and inside their cells.  The trial results have been reported in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal. ""Cefiderocol was found to be both safe and tolerable,"" says Dr Portsmouth. The study is a rare development in the field.  Bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics is making some infections incredibly difficult to treat.  The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance made stark predictions for the future, including 10 million people dying every year from drug-resistant infections by 2050. Yet new drugs are in scarce supply.  Prof Serge Mostowy, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""This important study offers hope for a new antibiotic that could potentially be an alternative to treating them, but we are not there yet."" Much larger trials are still needed to be sure of the effectiveness of the new antibiotic.  Experiments in people with pneumonia and those with infections that are resistant to some of our most powerful drugs, carbapenems, are already under way. However, once cefiderocol is smuggled inside, it kills bacteria in the same way as current antibiotics.  Experts say that new classes of antibiotics - that attack bacteria in completely new ways - are urgently needed.  Follow James on Twitter.",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45978891,"For children, the fear and pain of medical treatments can be traumatic. So a number of tech companies have come up with ways to help.   Vaccinations save lives, but many children fear the needle.  So one project in Brazil has turned to virtual reality (VR) as a way of helping kids cope.  The VR Vaccine project involves them wearing a VR headset and watching a 3D animated adventure story involving heroes in coats of armour defending their land against a villain.  The nurse can see the story on a separate screen and the action is synchronised with action of cleansing the skin and applying the injection. The project was launched by pharmacy chain Hermes Pardini to help with their vaccination campaigns, with local design studios VZLAB and Lobo creating the content. ""What we learned from doing this project is that children mostly fear the needle, more than the pain itself,"" says Luiz Evandro, director at VZLAB and Lobo.  ""So, in theory, if one could take 'the approaching needle away', the fear itself would also disappear. That ended up happening perfectly.""  The immersive storytelling alleviated their fears and helped by relaxing the child's muscles, he says, making it much easier for the nurse to administer the shot. The results of the VR Vaccine project have been so positive that Hermes Pardini has installed the headsets in all 80 of its pharmacies. Mr Evandro believes VR has the potential to help with a range of other medical scenarios to relieve patients' stress, although initially, its application will be limited by the need to synchronise the story with the medical intervention.   ""This solution has a lot to grow in terms of development, not only by incorporating interactivity into it, but also by having the possibility of being customisable to specific users,"" says Mr Evandro.  ""We feel that we've only scratched the surface of what's doable here."" Tech is also helping kids diagnosed with chronic illnesses to express their feelings and cope with their treatments. For example, US-based Sproutel has developed a robo-duck that lets children undergoing cancer treatment tap a ""feeling card"" representing a certain emotion against the duck's chest. The duck then expresses that feeling.  ""This enables children to communicate their feelings to doctors and caregivers using the duck, which can often be difficult for children as young as three years old,"" explains Aaron Horowitz, Sproutel co-founder and chief executive. The duck also has a catheter accessory, enabling children to administer chemotherapy to their ducks. Mr Horowitz says this type of medical play can give children a comforting feeling of control over their medical treatments. ""Preliminary studies have shown that children feel the duck helps reduce their stress level at the hospital,"" says Mr Horowitz.   ""The average length of cancer treatment for a child is 1,000 days - this is incredibly scary. Supporting children and families through this difficult time is critical."" So far, Sproutel has had orders for 600 of the $200 ducks from 37 hospitals in US, it says. Insurance company Aflac is covering the cost of a duck for every child cancer patient who requests one. Robots are also making their way into children's hospital wards.  Canada's RXRobots, for example, has spent years developing its MEDi humanoid robot, designed to establish a relationship with a child and teach cognitive-behavioural coping strategies through games and conversations. Say a child is anxious about undergoing a treatment, MEDi will say he is familiar with the medical procedure and play a game involving deep breathing exercises. Through play, the child relaxes and stops focusing on the procedure. MEDi is also used for therapeutic play, whereby children can perform procedures on him. While doing so, MEDi makes comments such as ""you're taking good care of me"". This teaches the child that healthcare professionals are also trying to help, even when performing sometimes painful medical procedures.  RXRobots founder Dr Tanya Beran claims the robot can help reduce children's pain during medical procedures by 50%, based on reports from children, their parents and nurses. More Technology of Business Jackie Pearson, child life specialist for the MEDi project at Alberta Children's Hospital says: ""With MEDi's guidance I have seen children calmly comply with medical procedures that can be quite distressing. ""I have noticed that it helps to relax both children and the adults who care for them."" Dr Beran believes interaction with MEDi could not only help children undergoing treatments, but shape their attitudes towards healthcare throughout the rest of their lives.  ""MEDi is transforming healthcare by helping children develop an alternate experience in hospitals and dental offices,"" she says.  But the robot is not perfect yet. Ms Pearson says the internet connection can sometimes drop, making the robot unresponsive, and occasionally there are delays before it answers. And at $15,000, it isn't cheap. Alberta Children's Hospital has four of them. ""But some of the interactions have been absolutely incredible,"" she says. ""I have seen hundreds of the best smiles ever!""",,,,

The BBC followed his progress. ""I've lost count of how many doctors and nurses have seen me naked over the years,"" says Anick. ""In the past few years alone it's been more than 100."" Anick was born with genitals that didn't resemble either a boy's or a girl's.  ""The doctors said to my parents: 'This child is mostly like a boy, but we're not sure yet,'"" he says. He did have testicles but they were in the wrong place, so his first operation - to move them - came at the age of four months. Throughout his childhood, people would tell Anick that he wasn't really like other boys.  ""I knew there was something different about me, but I didn't understand what,"" he says. ""I knew that my parents loved me, but at the same time they were taking me to the hospital every six months, where the doctors would use words like 'abnormal' and 'atypical' when they were talking about me."" He found it hard to make friends at school, and remembers holding his breath as a young child, in an attempt to suffocate himself, and wrestling with the childproof safety caps on bottles of bleach. After a more serious suicide attempt at the age of 14 he was given counselling, but couldn't bring himself to reveal the source of his troubles to the counsellor. ""I didn't want anyone else to know who didn't need to know,"" he says. ""It was very, very isolating."" ""I thought no-one knew what was different about me, that I was the only one in the world, just some random miracle case,"" he says.  It was only five years ago, at the age of 18, that he learned there was a name for this - and the reason for all his operations and hormone treatments: he was ""intersex"". This discovery, and the realisation that there are other people out there like him, made a huge difference, he says: ""Suddenly I realised that I don't have to be ashamed of who I am and how I was born.""  Doctors had also told Anick that he could begin reconstructive surgery to create a new penis when he turned 18 and could give his own consent. They told him not to rush to any decision and to go ahead only when he felt comfortable. You can watch The Intersex Diaries on the BBC iPlayer Three years later, in 2016, Anick decided that he was ready. ""That's when I had an epiphany,"" he says. ""I needed to start telling people. I needed to tell the truth. I was going to be going through a lot of major surgeries, and how many times can you have your appendix out? I'd lost count of the number of times I'd used that excuse."" He began by telling his cousins, uncles and aunts and was surprised when they didn't react with disgust. ""I didn't know people could be so accepting of something I had been hiding for so long,"" he says. The final operation was scheduled for June 2018, giving Anick hope that before long he would at last feel confident enough to embark on his first ever romantic relationship. It's February 2018 and Anick is on his way to the Organisation Intersex International (OII) conference in Copenhagen. He's excited but also really nervous. ""It's quite surreal,"" he says. ""For the first time in my life I won't be the odd one out. I'm finding out about my people - that sounds weird, but that's what it feels like."" Delegates like Anick are arriving from all over the world to discuss issues that concern all of them,  and to share their experiences.  ""As weird as this may sound, within a few hours of meeting we were all talking about our genitals,"" Anick says.  An umbrella term used to describe people who are born with biological variations in their sex characteristics that don't fit typical male or female categories There are many possible variations, involving genitalia, ovaries and testicles, chromosome patterns and hormones The UN says that according to experts, between 0.05% and 1.7% of the population is born with intersex traits. He enjoys the feeling of being around people to whom he doesn't need to explain himself. He wonders if this is how it feels to be ""normal"".  But he's also surprised to find himself feeling slightly isolated too, because so many people have experiences that are different from his. It's unsettling.  ""I'm with people who might understand how I'm feeling, but at the same time they haven't been through the same thing,"" he says. Overall, it's a bittersweet experience that leaves Anick with mixed feelings. ""It's the story of my life,"" he says. ""I don't fit in as a male, I don't fit in as an intersex person. So what am I? Who am I? It sucks."" Later Anick Skypes an intersex activist from Chicago, Pidgeon Pagonis. Like Anick, Pidgeon was born without a fully-formed penis or vagina - but in Pidgeon's case surgeons decided to create a vagina, rather than a penis.  Pidgeon was raised a girl, but now uses the pronoun ""they"" rather than ""she"". Only when they were at university did they learn the truth about the procedures they underwent as a child, and learn that they were intersex. Pidgeon now regards these operations as unnecessary cosmetic procedures, and argues that using surgery to alter an otherwise healthy intersex child's body is a violation of human rights. ""I would say, 'Please let your child grow up as the intersex person that they are and let them one day have autonomy over their own bodies,"" Pidgeon says. ""We should be pressuring doctors to stop perfecting surgeries for infants and start perfecting surgeries for intersex adults, who may want them."" That's an idea that chimes with Anick, who says that when he was growing up his family weren't even made aware that waiting for surgery was an option. ""If a doctor tells you your child needs surgery - you just go along with that,"" he says. After attending the OII conference and talking to Pidgeon, Anick also thinks that many of the operations he had as a child were ""purely cosmetic"". He has been thinking hard about whether he definitely wants the operation he is scheduled to undergo, or whether it's just something people have made him feel he needs in order to have a happier life. But he decides to go ahead. It's now June 2018 and Anick is about to go into hospital.  A year ago doctors took skin from Anick's left arm to create a phallus. It's taken a year for him to be able to use it to go to urinate properly.  ""You've heard of the phrase, 'I wear my heart on my sleeve,' well, I kind of wear my penis on mine,"" he jokes, as he shows the large scar left behind on his forearm from where the skin was removed. He goofs around as he gets changed into the surgical stockings, underwear and gown, a routine that's all too familiar now. Today a prosthetic device is going to be fitted into Anick's penis that he will need to pump up if he wants to have penetrative sex. ""I kind of feel like a cyborg,"" he says. ""But at least I won't have performance or anxiety issues."" Part of him thinks it's really cool that he is going to have this device implanted into his penis, but he does wonder how he's going to explain it to someone when he's in a relationship. He's never had a relationship, though he's hopeful that after this operation he will. ""Everything in my life is going to be different,"" Anick says. ""I'm finally going to have the closest thing to what other guys have, and maybe I'll be able to experience what other people do when they're my age. I've always avoided relationships out of disgust towards my own body and self- hatred, but I've really been working on getting over that."" The operation goes well. Anick says that things down there look pretty different now. He's not sure how long it will take him to get used to it. As the painkillers wear off he gets ready to go home, where his parents are going to be looking after him. It's awkward because his new penis has to stay in a specific position for the next week and it looks like he has a permanent erection. ""Whenever people come to visit me I just look really happy to see them, even when I'm not,"" he says. A month has passed. Since coming out of hospital Anick has been in a lot of pain. He's never felt pain like this before, despite his long history of operati",,,,
1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45992725,"The story of a man who ended up needing a liver transplant after taking green tea capsules has brought the topic of dietary supplements back into the news. What are some of the dangers of supplements and what are the health benefits? When Jim McCants started taking green tea pills he had hoped he was giving his health a shot in the arm. Instead, it appears the pills caused such serious damage to his liver that it required an urgent transplant. Experts point out that experiences like that of Mr McCants, are ""extremely unusual"".  In the UK, supplements are subject to EU regulations over their safety and the health claims manufacturers make about the products.  Approved supplements bought from reputable businesses are almost always going to be safe, provided the manufacturer's instructions are followed, doctors say. But it is wrong to assume that food supplements do not sometimes have the potential to be harmful, says Dr Wayne Carter, from the University of Nottingham. If you take supplements in quantities above recommended levels there are risks. While in many cases excess levels of a supplement will be excreted, there is the potential for it to be toxic, particularly to the liver, which detoxifies the substances we consume. ""I think sometimes the idea that people take on board is 'this is good for me, therefore if I take even more of it, it will be even better',"" Dr Carter says.  ""This isn't without risk.""  There is also a potential danger in indiscriminately taking many supplements at the same time, says Dr Carter.  Sometimes they can interact with one another - that is, one supplement may strengthen the effects of another - while in other cases they might contain one or more of the same nutrients, potentially leading to excess levels. Some of us may be less able to metabolise certain substances effectively, which can also influence how they affect us. ""The caveat with taking a supplement is it could be safe in a broad population, but not in everyone,"" Dr Carter adds. But if these are some of the potential risks, what are the health benefits? There are some supplements that are widely acknowledged by experts to be of benefit across the population. The NHS recommends that women who are thinking of having a baby should have a folic acid supplement, as should any pregnant woman up to week 12 of her pregnancy, to prevent common birth defects in babies.  The government this week said it would consult on adding folic acid to flour, following repeated calls for the move from experts. Vitamin D supplements are also recommended in babies, children between the ages of one and four, and people who are not often exposed to the sun.  This includes those who are frail or housebound or usually wear clothes that cover up most of their skin when outdoors. The rest of the population is advised to consider taking a Vitamin D supplement. A lack of vitamin D, which we mostly get from the sun, can lead to bone deformities such as rickets in children, and bone pain caused by a condition called osteomalacia in adults. Dr Benjamin Jacobs, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, said: ""A hundred years ago most children in London had rickets. That was basically abolished by the practice of giving children a vitamin supplement.""  An injection of vitamin K is also offered to babies within the first 24 hours of their life to prevent a rare but serious blood disorder. Dr Jacobs said supplements are also important for people with either restricted diets or allergies. For example, the NHS says vegans might need a vitamin B12 supplement, because it is only found naturally in foods from animal sources.  However, in many other supplements the evidence of there being a benefit for most people is less clear.  For example, the NHS says that most people do not need to take other vitamin supplements and can get all the vitamins and minerals they need, apart from vitamin D, from a balanced diet.  The benefits of fish oil pills, a supplement linked to a wide range of purported benefits, from improved heart health to boosted brain power, are also not conclusive. A recent review of scientific trials found the evidence that fish oil pills protect the heart was flimsy at best. Sam Jennings, a director of Berry Ottaway & Associates Ltd, a consultancy that works with supplement manufacturers, said nutrition was a ""constantly evolving science, there is always new data emerging"". She added: ""What has become clear is that with supplements the benefits aren't always going to be obvious in all people, because it's going to depend on that individual's own make-up as to whether they will receive benefit from having an extra nutrient of some kind."" Dr Carter said his own advice would be for people to look at what kind of scientific evidence there was in support of a particular supplement before taking it and check whether there are any warnings.

The BBC asked universities across the UK for the numbers of students seeking some form of support. The National Union of Students said young people were under increasing pressure to perform. The Department for Education said universities needed to provide pastoral care for students. In August, a pre-inquest hearing into the death of a vulnerable student at Bristol University heard she did not receive well-being support. Natasha Abrahart, 20, is one of 11 students at the university to die since October 2016.   The university later issued a statement, saying it had made offers of support towards Ms Abrahart. Christian Frank, from the University of Birmingham, said: ""Universities are just accepted by students to be a hotbed for stress and anxiety. The drinking culture at university allowed me to hide away, numbing my pain and normalising being exhausted in the day and hyperactive at night. ""I'd been ill throughout the course and talked to the extenuating circumstances officer about how many lectures I'd missed but my anxiety was too high to admit that I had a problem.  ""By admitting to someone at the university, I'm telling them that I feel like I'm not good enough to finish a course I signed up for. This means there's a lot of shame attached to asking for help.""  Will had gone to university feeling ""quite positive"" but found his mental health deteriorated during the first term. He admitted things had been tough, being away from his family, and because he had not immediately ""found his feet"" by joining societies and making friends. Will said the idea of seeking help with mental health issues was not easy. ""On the university mental health counselling website there is a form you fill out that ranks your answers from not at all to very likely - there are a lot of very triggering questions. ""[But it] felt like almost immediately you opened it there's less of a chance you are going to get in because there will be people filling it in as 'likely' for every single thing."" Two months after completing the form he was emailed to say he had not been accepted for one-on-one counselling.  ""I'm feeling better now but was definitely in a worse place after the experience of not getting help,"" he said. ""It's something the uni needs to focus on... and make more personal."" Kayleigh, from the University of Bristol, said: ""A friend of mine was suicidal at uni. We got him referred to the university counselling service but he was on a long waiting list. They suggested he talk to a tutor and maybe if he'd done that he would have got counselling sooner but he was so stressed about the course that he didn't want to. It was really hard to get anyone to take any notice. ""One night he was threatening suicide, I took him to A&E and they sent him home. I didn't know what to do so my mum sent the vice chancellor a very angry email, basically saying, if he dies, it's on your hands. The next day, uni mental health services got in touch and referred him to an emergency external counselling service.  ""He ended up dropping out and is much healthier and happier but the uni really should have dealt with it better. Especially since Bristol is in the news about high suicide rates - he could very easily have been another.""  Of 83 universities that provided five years of full data from 2012 to 2017, the number of students seeking help rose from 50,900 to 78,100.  The number of students going to university dropped slightly over the same period. At the same time, budgets towards mental health services increased by more than 40%. Eva Crossan Jory, the NUS Vice President, said: ""There is a growth in demand [for mental health services] over the last decade, in part, because the reality of studying in the UK has changed so much.  ""Many are balancing work, study and caring responsibilities. With fees so high, and the job market so competitive, students feel they have to continually push themselves, perhaps more so than before."" Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: ""University is supposed to be an assault on the senses. It should be demanding and disorientating, and with that should come adequate pastoral care for students‚Äé. ""This does not mean mollycoddling or cushioning students from the experiences that are part and parcel of university life, it means making sure support services are available if they need them."" A University of Bristol spokesperson said it had adopted a university-wide approach to identify vulnerable students as early as possible and get them the right support.

They have trained dogs to recognise tell-tale aromas using clothes from people infected with the disease. It is hoped the animals can be used to stop malaria spreading and eventually help with eradication.  Although the research is still at an early stage, experts say the findings may even lead to new ways of testing for the disease. Studies have already shown that being infected with the malaria parasite changes our aroma to make us more attractive to the mosquitoes that spread the disease.  Now dogs are on the scent, too. Socks worn overnight by children in the Upper River Region of The Gambia, in West Africa, were packaged and shipped to the UK. Of the 175 pairs sent, 30 had been worn by children infected with the parasite. The smelly footwear arrived at the Medical Detection Dogs charity in Milton Keynes.  The supremely talented noses there are already being trained to sniff out cancer and even the early stages of Parkinson's disease.  When it came to spotting malaria, the results, presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, showed dogs could pick out seven in 10 samples from infected children. But they also incorrectly thought one in 10 healthy children had malaria.  Researcher Prof Steve Lindsay, from Durham University, said he was ""really excited"" by the findings so far, but that dogs were not yet ready to be used more routinely. The researchers still need to improve the dog's accuracy and test them on people rather than socks, as well as investigate whether the animals can sniff out different species of malaria. The aim is to one day use specially trained dogs at airports to curb the spread of the disease and to find symptomless carriers to help eradication efforts.  Dogs could test a whole community in a short space of time. Chelci Squires, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC: ""Dogs are actually nature's super-smellers so it is a great gift to have them. ""They are much faster than existing rapid diagnostic tests which can take up to 20 minutes and require a fully trained professional to do."" New tools to detect, treat and prevent malaria are needed as progress is stalling.  According to the last global report on the disease, cases had increased by five million to a new total of 216 million cases a year. The research was a collaboration between The National Malaria Control Programme in The Gambia; the Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia; Medical Detection Dogs; Durham University; the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the University of Dundee.

In informal talks a day after clocks changed, transport ministers suggested the 2019 timetable to scrap seasonal clock changes was unrealistic, an official said. The EU proposal would allow states to choose permanent summer or winter time. It was arguably only a matter of time as an EU-wide survey found most people favoured scrapping daylight saving. ""If we aim to do this in 2019, as the [European] Commission suggested, this will not be supported by the majority of member states,"" said Austrian Transport Minister Norbert Hofer, who hosted his 27 EU counterparts in Graz.

The plan to stop changing Europe's clocks in October 2019 is a signature policy of EC President Jean-Claude Juncker, announced last month.

But researchers say they need not wait as long as the 18 months recommended in the current World Health Organization guidelines.  Small gaps between pregnancies risk premature births, smaller babies and infant and mother mortality.   The researchers hope the findings will be ""reassuring"" for older women.  Senior study author Dr Wendy Norman said it was ""encouraging news"" for women over 35 who were planning their families.  ""Older mothers for the first time have excellent evidence to guide the spacing of their children,"" she said.  ""Achieving that optimal one-year interval should be doable for many women and is clearly worthwhile to reduce complication risks."" The study, of nearly 150,000 births in Canada, by University of British Columbia (UBC) and the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health is published in JAMA Internal Medicine.  The study found 12-to-18 months was the ideal length of time between giving birth and becoming pregnant again. Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend an ideal interval of 24 months and no fewer than 18 months.   The researchers also found: The study's lead author, Laura Schummers, said: ""Our study found increased risks to both mother and infant when pregnancies are closely spaced, including for women older than 35.  ""The findings for older women are particularly important, as older women tend to more closely space their pregnancies and often do so intentionally."" The study looked at only one population of women - in Canada - so it is unclear how applicable this would be worldwide.  Researcher Dr. Sonia Hernandez-Diaz said the findings suggested different risks for each age group.  ""Short pregnancy spacing might reflect unplanned pregnancies, particularly among young women.  ""Whether the elevated risks are due to our bodies not having time to recover if we conceive soon after delivering or to factors associated with unplanned pregnancies, like inadequate prenatal care, the recommendation might be the same: improve access to postpartum contraception, or abstain from unprotected sexual intercourse with a male partner following a birth."" Mandy Forrester, from the Royal College of Midwives, said the study was ""useful research and builds on previous research into birth spacing"".  ""Ultimately, it will be a woman's choice, whatever age they are, about how long they leave between their pregnancies. What is important is that they are aware of the evidence around birth spacing and that they make their choice armed with the right information.  ""Health professionals will always support a woman in her choice, which will be about what is right for them and their pregnancy. She said women needed access to contraceptive advice to allow them to space their births, if that was their choice, but said in specialist family planning service provision in the UK was ""patchy, with GPs frequently offering only oral contraception"".

1810,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46019429,"A professor of surgery says students have spent so much time in front of screens and so little time using their hands that they have lost the dexterity for stitching or sewing up patients. Roger Kneebone, professor of surgical education at Imperial College, London, says young people have so little experience of craft skills that they struggle with anything practical. ""It is important and an increasingly urgent issue,"" says Prof Kneebone, who warns medical students might have high academic grades but cannot cut or sew. ""It is a concern of mine and my scientific colleagues that whereas in the past you could make the assumption that students would leave school able to do certain practical things - cutting things out, making things - that is no longer the case,"" says Prof Kneebone. The professor, who teaches surgery to medical students, says young people need to have a more rounded education, including creative and artistic subjects, where they learn to use their hands. Do smartphones really affect surgeons' skills? Prof Kneebone says he has seen a decline in the manual dexterity of students over the past decade - which he says is a problem for surgeons, who need craftsmanship as well as academic knowledge. ""An obvious example is of a surgeon needing some dexterity and skill in sewing or stitching,"" he says. ""A lot of things are reduced to swiping on a two-dimensional flat screen,"" he says, which he argues takes away the experience of handling materials and developing physical skills. Such skills might once have been gained at school or at home, whether in cutting textiles, measuring ingredients, repairing something that's broken, learning woodwork or holding an instrument. Students have become ""less competent and less confident"" in using their hands, he says. ""We have students who have very high exam grades but lack tactile general knowledge,"" says the professor. Prof Kneebone will be speaking on Tuesday at the V&A Museum of Childhood in east London, at the launch of a report, published by the Edge Foundation, calling for more creativity in the curriculum. Alice Barnard, chief executive of the Edge education charity, says: ""The government pays lip service by saying creative subjects are important, but its policies demonstrate otherwise."" She says the way school performance is measured tends to push schools to focus on core academic subjects, to the detriment of arts and creative subjects. The report warns that entries to creative subjects have fallen by 20% since 2010, including a 57% fall in design and technology GCSE. Tristram Hunt, director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, will be speaking alongside Prof Kneebone. ""Creativity is not just for artists. Subjects like design and technology, music, art and drama are vitally important for children to develop imagination and resourcefulness, resilience, problem-solving, team-working and technical skills,"" says Mr Hunt. ""These are the skills which will enable young people to navigate the changing workplace of the future and stay ahead of the robots, not exam grades.""",,,,

Detectives say Niels H√∂gel administered fatal doses of medication to the people in his care - causing cardiac arrest - at two hospitals in northern Germany. His motive, prosecutors say, was to impress colleagues by trying to revive the very patients he had attacked. H√∂gel, 41, is already serving a life term for six deaths while in his care. He is now said to have killed 36 patients in Oldenburg and 64 in nearby Delmenhorst between 1999 and 2005. When asked by the judge in the Oldenburg court if the charges against him were true, the 41-year-old confessed to ""more or less"" all of them.  The current trial, which started with a minute's silence for the victims, is expected to last until May. It follows years of toxicology tests on 130 sets of exhumed remains. By Jenny Hill, BBC News, Berlin Dozens of relatives of those who died at the hands of Niels H√∂gel were in court to hear his confession.  Many of them are demanding to know how he was able to kill - with apparent impunity - so many people in the confines of two hospitals.  Death rates rose significantly during H√∂gel's time.  Disturbing details have emerged: it's been widely reported that H√∂gel was allowed to continue working for two days after he was caught ""red handed"" having administered drugs to a patient, during which time he killed another patient.  Many relatives believe health authorities chose to turn a blind eye. An investigation is under way to determine whether their actions facilitated the murderous ambitions of post-war Germany's most prolific serial killer. Investigators say he may have killed even more but potential victims have been cremated. Christian Marbach, a spokesperson for relatives, said it was a scandal the ex-nurse had been allowed to kill with impunity for years without officials intervening.  ""We fought for four years for this trial and expect H√∂gel is sentenced for another 100 murders,"" said Mr Marbach, whose grandfather was killed by H√∂gel. ""I hope he will be found guilty on each count so that the loved ones can finally find some closure,"" said Petra Klein, who runs a victims' support group. Relatives of his alleged victims were expected to pack the court but journalists in the room noted many empty seats in reserved rows. H√∂gel was first caught in 2005 injecting unprescribed medication into a patient in Delmenhorst. In 2008 he was jailed for seven years for attempted murder. In 2014-15, a second trial found him guilty of two murders and two attempted murders and he was given the maximum sentence. He said he was ""honestly sorry"" and hoped families would find peace. He said the decisions to carry out his crimes had been ""relatively spontaneous"". However, during the trial he confessed to a psychiatrist that he had killed up to 30 people. Investigators then widened the investigation, exhuming 130 former patients and looking for evidence of medication that could have triggered cardiac arrest. They also pored over records in the hospitals he worked at. Records at the Oldenburg hospital showed rates of deaths and resuscitations had more than doubled when H√∂gel was on shift, German media reported.",,,,

The House of Commons Science and Technology Committee says despite repeated warnings, not enough is being done to make sure the results of all clinical trials are reported. Nearly half of clinical trials go unreported, evidence suggests.  It means some clinical decisions are made without all the available data. In some cases, this might endanger human life, says the group of MPs. They give the example of heart drug lorcainide, which was tested in 1980.  The results showed that people who were taking it were more likely to die than those who were not, but those findings were not published until 1993 - long after it was made available to patients in the US. The committee also heard that ""publication bias"" may have led to UK public money being wasted, for example when the government's decided to spend ¬£424m to stockpile Tamiflu in response to the H1N1 ""swine flu"" epidemic in 2009. Dr Simon Kolstoe, a researcher at the University of Portsmouth and chairman of two ethics committees, told the committee: ""Eight out of the 10 trials that were used by the company to show the drug was useful in preventing complications such as pneumonia had never actually been peer-reviewed or published."" He said this meant governments were ""relying on a marketing spiel claiming successful trials of this drug, rather than being able to consider the actual evidence of the drug efficacy for themselves"". The NHS Health Research Authority (HRA) has been responsible for ""promoting research transparency"" since 2014, but the committee says not enough has been done to improve reporting rates.  MPs want the HRA to produce a strategy for fixing this problem and say its performance should be measured against progress.  The HRA says it is working with the industry to promote transparency. Committee chairman Norman Lamb said: ""Many of these trials are funded with public money and the taxpayer has a right to expect those who benefit from public funding to follow the rules and publish in full.""

The 67-year-old Kenyan told the BBC that he was in profound shock when doctors told him in 2013 that he had stage-three breast cancer, turning his life upside down. ""I was in denial and wondered why such a disease, which is not male-oriented, had singled me out of millions of men in the world,"" Mr Musonga said.  It all started with a painless lump in his right nipple that grew larger as time went by. Then came the nipple discharge and occasional chest pains. Doctors kept on giving Mr Musonga, a father of five, painkillers to treat something they were unsure about. And despite the fact that his breasts were unusually bigger than those of most men, Mr Musonga never thought it was anything to worry about. He sought medical help when the skin on his right breast began to ulcerate. Tests on a tissue sample confirmed that Mr Musonga had breast cancer. ""I hadn't known that breast cancer affects men and therefore didn't notice that what was affecting me was breast cancer,"" he said. Dr Sitna Mwanzi, a consultant medical oncologist at the Aga Khan University Hospital in the capital, Nairobi, said male breast cancer is not very common. Her experience showed that for every 100 breast cancer patients, one will be male.  Exact cause is unknown but risk of getting it increases because of: It is not certain if you can do anything to reduce your risk, but it may help if you: Source: UK's National Health Service About 6,000 cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in Kenya this year - making up 12.5% of all cancers in the country, according to Globocan 2008, which is part of the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer. Across the whole of Africa, they expect about 170,000 cases. Dr Mwanzi said women are more at risk for various reasons, including the fact that they have more oestrogen naturally than men.  ""When you have an excess of oestrogen, it stimulates a formation of more breast tissue and with that some of the cells can become abnormal and lead to breast cancer,"" she said. Dr Mwanzi added that both men and women should keep an eye out for symptoms, especially a lump on the breast. Other symptoms include changes in the skin on the breast and the nipple, bloodstained discharge from the nipple, and a change in the shape or size of one or both breasts. Cancer also brings about weight loss, she added. Dr Mwanzi said the main treatments for breast cancer were radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery and hormone therapy. ""Men should examine their breasts for lumps on a regular basis. They should be checking themselves very often,"" she added.

As breast cancer is linked to women, Mr Musonga had feared that he would face some discrimination when he told people about the diagnosis.

Plastic surgeons say the number of life-changing injuries is rising every year despite numerous safety campaigns.  They believe shocking images, like the one they have mocked up using a man's severely damaged hand, might deter buyers.  Half of those seen in hospital last year were aged 18 or under, and 80% were male. The campaign is being led by the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (Bapras). Bapras president David Ward said: ""We are extremely concerned about the continued misuse of fireworks, particularly by those under the age of 18 away from organised events.  ""Although [fireworks are] packaged in a jovial, toy-like fashion, people forget that when using fireworks, they are handling explosives which can cause extremely serious injuries that may require extensive reconstructive surgery. ""Bapras is calling on the government to make a common-sense change by legislating to ensure all firework packaging in the UK includes mandatory graphic warning notices, similar to those found on cigarette packaging."" Almost 4,500 people in England attended A&E with injuries from fireworks last year, double the number in 2009-10, according to figures from NHS Digital.   Surgeons say injuries are typically caused by people throwing rockets which either explode early, or hit someone close by.  The hand used in the campaign belongs to a 25-year-old-man from Wales, who did not wish to be identified.  ""My friend threw a firework which landed by my feet. When I picked it up to move it out of the way, it exploded in my hand. I've had five operations, with plastic surgeons reconstructing parts of my fingers, and months later I still have three operations to go.  ""The incident has had a huge impact on my life. I can't feed myself or play with my new-born kid.  ""A clearer warning label might have made me and my friend think twice about the potential danger,"" he said. Many fireworks are currently packaged in the bold colours of children's toys, and the warnings are often found in small boxes on the back of the packaging. Legally you have to be 18 or over to buy fireworks, yet the hospital statistics show that many injuries requiring surgery are in males under the age of 18. Jim Fitzpatrick, MP for Poplar and Limehouse, is also supporting the campaign.  ""There is an urgent need for government to introduce graphic warnings on firework packaging. The hope is that a graphic image of the potential dangers of misuse may stop someone in their tracks, preventing a possible life-changing injury.""

Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there needed to be a shift in culture and in the way resources are balanced.  ""For too long the NHS has seen itself as essentially the National Hospital Service, with primary care and GPs round the side,"" he said.

Scientists gave people with suspected glioma a drink containing 5-ALA, a substance known to accumulate in fast-growing cancer cells. The pink glow the chemical causes was found in people with the most aggressive cancers.  Researchers hope it will make it easier for surgeons to distinguish between cancer cells and healthy brain tissue. Treatment for glioma, the most common form of brain cancer and the one that killed ex-Labour cabinet minister Dame Tessa Jowell, usually involves surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible, and the prognosis for patients is often poor. For this new trial, 99 patients with suspected high-grade (fast-growing) gliomas were given a drink containing 5-ALA before surgery. Research has previously shown that 5-ALA ends up in fast-growing cancer cells, because they lack an enzyme needed to break down the chemical.  Surgeons used microscopes to help them look for fluorescent tissue while removing tumours from the patients' brains.  During their operations, surgeons reported seeing fluorescence in 85 patients.  Of these, 81 were confirmed by pathologists to have high-grade disease, one was found to have low-grade disease and three could not be assessed. In the 14 patients in whom surgeons did not see any fluorescence, seven tumours were found to be low-grade gliomas while the other seven could not be assessed. Study author Dr Kathreena Kurian, associate professor in brain tumour research at the University of Bristol, said: ""There's an urgent need to have something while the patient is on the table, while the neurosurgeon is operating, which will guide them to find the worst bits. ""The beauty of 5-ALA is that they can see where high-grade glioma is, while they're operating."" The researchers caution that the study looked at patients who were already suspected to have high-grade tumours, and a larger study in which more patients have low-grade disease would provide more information on the use of this technique.  Other types of markers may need to be tested for detecting low-grade glioma cells, they say. Next steps could include testing the 5-ALA in children with brain tumours, or to help surgeons distinguish between tumour tissue and scar tissue in adult patients, whose brain cancers have recurred following treatment. Dr Paul Brennan, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""Highlighting the more aggressive tumour cells in real-time could help doctors achieve the delicate balance between removing as much of the tumour as possible while preserving surrounding healthy tissue.  ""The fluorescent marker may also ease the burden of follow-up treatment, as cancer cells left behind after surgery require additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy."" The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence approved the use of 5-ALA for patients with brain tumours, prior to surgery, earlier this year. The research is being presented at the 2018 NCRI Cancer Conference in Glasgow from 4 to 6 November. Follow Alex on Twitter.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46078989,"Scientists in the US have recruited an unlikely ally in their efforts to develop a new flu treatment.  Llamas have been used to produce a new antibody therapy that has the potential to work against all types of flu, including new pandemics.  Influenza is the ultimate shape-shifter, constantly mutating its appearance to evade our immune system.  That is why a new flu jab is needed each winter and why the vaccine sometimes misses the mark.  Science is on the hunt for a way to kill all types of flu, no matter the strain or how much it mutates.  That's where the llama, better known for its wool, comes in.  The animals produce incredibly tiny antibodies in comparison to our own. Antibodies are weapons of the immune system and they bind to the proteins that stick out from the surface of a virus.  Human antibodies tend to attack the tips of those proteins, but that's the part influenza mutates most readily. Llama antibodies use their size advantage to wriggle a little bit deeper and attack the parts that flu cannot change. The team at the Scripps Institute in California infected llamas with multiple types of flu to provoke an immune response. They then scoured llama blood for the most potent antibodies that could attack a wide range of flu strains. They picked four, and then set about building their own synthetic antibody that used elements from each.  It was tested on mice, which were given deadly doses of influenza.  Prof Ian Wilson, one of the researchers, told the BBC's Science in Action: ""It's very effective, there were 60 different viruses that were used in the challenge and only one wasn't neutralised and that's a virus that doesn't infect humans. ""The goal here is to provide something that would work from season to season, and also protect you from possible pandemics should they emerge."" The work, published in the journal Science, is very early stage research and the team want to do more tests before starting human trials.  The researchers tried two approaches to giving the animals the antibody.  The first was to inject them with the antibodies, and the second was a type of gene therapy.  The genetic instructions for making the antibody were packaged up inside a harmless virus, which was then used to infect the noses of mice.  The cells in the linings of the nose then started making the flu-killing antibody. An additional advantage of this approach is that it could work in the elderly. The older you are the worse your immune system gets, and the less effective the seasonal flu vaccine becomes.  But the llama-inspired approach does not need to train the immune system. Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, told the BBC: ""Having a treatment that can work across a range of different strains of virus is highly sought after. It's the Holy Grail of influenza. ""There will be an appetite, but it depends how well these things work, how easy it is to produce and also how costly it will be."" Follow James on Twitter.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46059306,"Britain's High Streets are getting unhealthier, according to a report analysing 70 major UK towns and cities. The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) ranked High Streets with more payday lenders, bookmakers, tanning salons and fast food outlets the worst. Grimsby led the unhealthy High Street list ahead of Walsall and Blackpool, while Edinburgh, Canterbury and Taunton had the healthiest outlets. There was a clear link between deprived areas and unhealthy High Streets. Outlets that were considered healthy included leisure centres, health services, libraries, museums and art galleries.  The report also considered pubs and bars as being a positive presence on the High Street because they are centres for social interaction. However, pubs are in decline and many people are using the UK's 22,000 coffee shops as places to socialise, eat and drink instead.  'The food supplement that ruined my liver' Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator Ruddock 'deliberately broke Cole's legs' The number of fast-food outlets on UK streets rose by 4,000 between 2014 and 2017, mostly in deprived areas. The links between typically high-fat fast food, weight gain and obesity are well documented. Fast food outlets sometimes engage in what the RSPH report calls ""upselling""; where staff are trained to persuade customers to buy additional or larger portions. Payday lenders and bookmakers were considered unhealthy businesses because of the ""devastating consequences"" debt can have on health as well as on family and work life, the report said.  London's High Streets were not considered in the report, as they have been ranked separately. The report paints a picture of the rapidly changing British High Street dominated by cafes and coffee shops, convenience stores, off-licences, vape shops and boarded-up premises. Vape shops were counted as a 'healthier' business, because of their role in discouraging smoking. However, the report added the ""precise long-term effects of vaping are unknown"".   'Five times more fast food' in poor areas Will Hammond's Budget save the High Street? Fast food shops 'flooding high streets' Shirley Cramer, RSPH chief executive said: ""When our time and money are converted into a loss at the bookmaker, a tan from a sunbed, a high-cost loan or a bucket of fried chicken, the High Street is enabling and supporting poor health behaviours. ""Our Health on the High Street rankings illustrate how unhealthy businesses concentrate in areas which already experience higher levels of deprivation, obesity and lower life expectancy.  ""Reshaping these High Streets to be more health-promoting could serve as a tool to help redress this imbalance.""  The rise in online retail is linked to the growing numbers of empty premises, which have increased from 7% in 2007 to 11% in 2017. This year the High Street has seen several big name closures including Toys R Us and Maplin and, in this week's Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond cut the business rates for small retailers, and proposed a new tax on online retailers in an effort to boost physical shops. However industry bodies said the changes didn't go far enough. The RSPH is calling for further measures including urging local authorities to make vacant properties publicly accessible for what is known as ""meanwhile use"" - pop-up art galleries or community centres.  The London rankings showed that the borough of Haringey boasted both the most unhealthy street, West Green Road in Seven Sisters, and the healthiest one, in Muswell Hill.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46059186,"Children and adolescents account for nearly half of A&E attendances for sporting injuries, research suggests.  An analysis of A&E data at two hospitals between 2012 and 2014 found 47% of attendances for sport-related injuries were made by under-19s. Football, rugby union and rugby league were linked to the most injuries in boys. For girls, it was trampolining, netball and horse-riding. Fourteen-year-old boys and 12-year-old girls were most likely to be injured. The authors say their findings should prompt schools to consider introducing injury prevention initiatives for child sport. Researchers, who looked at 11,676 accident and emergency attendances for sport-related injuries at two hospitals in Oxfordshire, found 10- to 14-year-olds were the group of children most likely to be injured, followed by 15- to 19-year-olds. The data did not show how many of these attendances led to admissions.  Almost a quarter of the injuries were fractures, most commonly to the upper limbs, the study found.  Football came top of the list for injuries for boys. Trampolining was worst for girls. Rugby union was the sport most associated with head injury and concussion in boys. While for girls, head injuries were most common during horse riding. Prof Allyson Pollock, from Newcastle University, said: ""Everybody goes on about the benefits of sport but we don't actually look at the downsides and risks of sports and we don't design our prevention strategies to be informed by that. ""This study has shed some light on the causes and scale of sport injuries and should act as a springboard for injury prevention initiatives in child sport, targeted specifically at the causal mechanisms for these often serious injuries."" Prof Pollock said the popularity of football was probably why the sport was linked to so many injuries.  In contrast, rugby union and rugby league had much lower levels of participation, she said.  Prof Pollock said studies such as this one could help experts monitor the rate of injury across various child sports.  Along with her colleagues, she says local authorities and schools should consider targeting sport injury prevention at children in the first four years of secondary school.  They say that for younger age groups, trampolines in the home warrant improved safety, while rugby and horse-riding should also be a focus for interventions. Although the study was based on information from two hospitals - the only two where such information was available - Prof Pollock said she expected the findings would be similar across the UK, albeit the proportion of injuries caused by certain sports may vary in some areas. Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said A&E services were already ""very overstretched"". He added: ""To relieve the pressure on these services, it's important that we reduce the number of preventable admissions by making sports safer for children and young people.  ""A scheme which would help to lessen the number of children becoming injured through sport is one that we would welcome."" The study, a collaboration between researchers at Newcastle University and Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, is published by the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine.",,,,

The BBC's Sangita Myska has been meeting people who say they've suffered from sex addiction, in order to understand whether it really exists, and if so, what it is. Neila's first job in the UK, after she arrived from Central Asia 15 years ago, was on the trading floor of a finance company dominated by what she describes as ""alpha-males, earning million-pound bonuses"". She was one of only two women on the team, and her male colleagues would sometimes try to provoke them by playing pornography on the big screens that should have been showing market data. ""I didn't like it but I was at the start of my career, making my way in the city. It was good money and a glamorous job and I didn't want to lose that,"" she says. ""I knew the men in the office were looking for a reaction - they wanted to shock me.  So I started going home and watching porn videos and DVDs on my own, so I could brush it off in the office."" But quickly Neila got hooked. Her upbringing in a socially conservative family where sex was never discussed left her ""defenceless"" she says.  Every day she was thinking about how quickly she could get home to choose a film and a sex toy and start to masturbate. She describes the process for me. ""It starts slowly. You get aroused. And then you just watch and simultaneously you switch on your equipment. All your senses are stimulated, watching something so exciting. Your mind goes elsewhere. You know it's not going to stop until you press the button. You know you're in control of it, of every aspect of your pleasure, and it gives you orgasms you just can't have with another human being - and certainly not a man. ""The whole process of masturbating and coming will take you a maximum of five to 10 minutes but you pull back because you don't want to exit this state you are in, which is basically like being intoxicated."" Using this technique, called ""edging"", she was watching porn for two to three hours, seven days a week. Listen to Addicted to Sex by Sangita Myska on Radio 4 on 5 November at 20:00, repeated on 7 November at 11:00 Download the Addicted to Sex podcast - six full and very frank conversations Sangita recorded for the programme Her behaviour was compulsive, she says.  If she couldn't watch porn, she craved it. She would also spend hours justifying it to herself, however detrimental it had become: ""Everything is safe, you're not going to catch an STD from watching porn, you don't have to wear make-up. Everything on your terms and with guaranteed results."" But to continue getting those guaranteed results, the type of pornography she was watching took a darker turn. ""Usually you start watching vanilla porn - that means male-on-female or female-on-female, normal stuff - and after a while it doesn't work any more. Your body gets used to this release. It's similar to drug addiction, you need to increase the dose, so in order to increase it you watch more hardcore stuff. ""So you start watching anal, and then after a while that becomes a new normal for you so you need to watch something more hardcore and then you start searching for extreme stuff like gang bangs."" This was very uncomfortable for Neila, who began to worry that she was ""a perv"", as she puts it. This issue of shame is a big one for every person who believes they are a sex addict. Shame simultaneously makes them want to hide away and drives them further into their compulsion. ""It's a cocktail of arousal and shame,"" Neila says.  Porn also changed her attitude towards men. It meant that when she looked for a potential partner, their personalities and character became almost irrelevant. ""I would look through their shirts to see if they had a six-pack,"" she says. ""The average UK penis size wasn't enough for me... but it's not a good way to choose a life partner."" She had a series of failed relationships, but it was the fact she felt compelled to watch films featuring violence against women to get a ""high"" that really began to terrify her. ""I had to ask myself, what's next? Will I end up watching a snuff movie just to satisfy my addiction?"" she says. Neila left the City and re-trained as a counsellor. Now in her 40s, she specialises in treating other patients who believe they are sex addicts. She trained at the Laurel Centre in central London, one of only a handful of clinics in the UK providing specialist support of this kind. To get it you have to pay, sometimes hundreds of pounds per hour, because the NHS doesn't recognise sex addiction as a genuine condition. But it's estimated that hundreds, if not thousands, of people seek treatment in the UK each year, the vast majority of them men. Where to get help Part of the reason for this may be that women are more ashamed and find it harder to confess to the problem. But whatever the explanation, Paul is more typical of those seeking help for this condition - both because he's a man, and also because he got his thrills from having sex rather than watching porn. In his 50s, tall and well-dressed in a crisp white shirt and jacket, Paul tells me his addiction began 30 years ago at university. He had a loving relationship with his girlfriend but one day, it seems, that wasn't enough for him. ""I loved her, I really did but for whatever reason I went to see a prostitute,"" he says. ""I was desperate for a thrilling sexual encounter and I knew that this was something I shouldn't be doing. I'd never be unfaithful to her with another girl but this felt like something different."" Within weeks, his behaviour had changed completely. ""I had about six girlfriends on the go at the same time and I was seeing two or three sex workers a week. It's almost like ordering a pizza in because I was hungry. I want something, I order it in, I forget about it."" He says he knew something was very wrong. But just as he began considering whether or not to confide in someone, or even get help, he landed his first job in London - and found himself in an environment where this kind of behaviour was actually encouraged. ""Life was unbelievable. Flying around the world on Concorde, earning a lot of money, frequenting the lap-dancing bars of London - you find yourself going out for a sexual thrill with the people you work with,"" Paul remembers. ""So at this point [I'm thinking] 'Maybe I haven't got a problem, maybe I'm just a normal sort of guy?'"" Even then, a nagging doubt remained at the back of Paul's mind. He would go with colleagues on a ""grand night out"" to the lap-dancing bars - so-called because each spent ¬£1,000 per night - on a Tuesday, perhaps, and maybe again on a Thursday. But Paul would be the only one going back on a Saturday.  Like Neila, Paul says he began to ""chase the high"". So much so, that despite being heterosexual, for 10 years he also had sex with men. ""I switched completely from women to men. So all my physical acting out was with men.  I can honestly say that I haven't got one ounce of homosexuality in me. It's really just seeking a higher thrill, that's what it came down to. And throughout this whole period I had some very very nice girlfriends."" Again, as with Neila, Paul says his behaviour was compulsive. If he wasn't having sex, he craved it. And again it wasn't reaching orgasm that was the goal - it was the set of behaviours around it that he was hooked on. Like Neila, he would stretch out the experience for hours at a time. ""The thrill is the build-up, the anticipation of what you're going to be doing‚Ä¶ the very last thing that you want to do is to ejaculate because at that point the whole process is over."" It took Paul a long time to get hooked on porn, after first discovering it at the age of 12. ""I did come across some magazines in my parents' house. I found them hidden when my parents were out. So it was a reasonably early exposure to porn. But, if I'm honest I can't remember feeling sexual excitement."" That changed when high-speed internet arrived. At that point his focus shifted from sex workers to online porn, which he would watch for hours on end.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46102193,"Women whose body clocks mean they are ""morning people"" have a lower risk of developing breast cancer, say UK researchers. The team at the University of Bristol says the reason why still needs to be uncovered. It adds the findings are important as they may affect every woman's risk. Experts said the study presented at the NCRI Cancer Conference in Glasgow added to a growing understanding of the importance of sleep in all health.  Everybody has a body clock, which governs how the body works in a roughly 24-hour pattern. It's also known as a circadian rhythm.  It affects everything from when we sleep, to our mood and even our risk of a heart attack.  But not everybody's clock tells the same time.  Morning people or ""larks"" are early to rise, peak earlier in the day and are tired earlier in the evening. Evening people or ""owls"" find it harder to get up in the morning, are productive later into the evening and prefer to go to sleep late. Take our quiz to find out whether you are a morning type, or an evening owl. The researchers think so. They used a clever new way of analysing data - called Mendelian randomisation. They looked at 341 snippets of DNA (the instructions for the human body) that control whether we are likely to be a lark or an owl.  They used this knowledge to perform an experiment on more than 180,000 women in the UK Biobank project and nearly 230,000 women in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium study. They showed people genetically programmed to be ""larks"" were less likely to have breast cancer than those programmed to be owls. Because these bits of DNA are set at birth and are not linked to other known causes of cancer, like obesity, it means the researchers are reasonably confident body clocks are involved in cancer.  Around one in seven women in the UK will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. But this study only looked at a small, eight-year snapshot of a woman's life.  In that time it showed two in 100 owls developed breast cancer compared with one in 100 larks.  Dr Rebecca Richmond, one of the researchers from the University of Bristol, told the BBC: ""The findings are potentially very important because sleep is ubiquitous and easily modified. ""Previous research has looked at the impact of shift work, but this is showing there may be a risk factor for all women."" Age and family history are some of the main risk factors for breast cancer. According to Cancer Research UK, around a quarter of cases might be preventable.  It's not that simple.  Dr Richmond said it was said it was still too soon to give clear advice to women.   She told the BBC: ""We still need to get at what makes an evening person more at risk than a morning person‚Ä¶ we need to unpick the relationship."" Is it something about the body clock itself? Or do ""owls"" cause damage by living out of time with their body clocks in order to get up and go to work? Does the body clock affect hormone levels to alter cancer risk, or the immune system, or metabolism? There are still many unanswered questions. Science is never 100% sure, but this fits with an emerging picture. The World Health Organization already says disruption to people's body clocks because of shift work is probably linked to cancer risk.  Dr Richard Berks, from Breast Cancer Now, said: ""These intriguing results add to the growing body of evidence that there is some overlap between the genetics of when we'd prefer to sleep and our breast cancer risk, but more research is required to unravel the specifics of this relationship."" Similar studies have revealed a role for sleep preferences and mental health, including schizophrenia risk. Cliona Kirwan, consultant breast surgeon and researcher at the University of Manchester, said: ""The use of Mendelian randomisation in this study enables the researchers to examine the causal effect on breast cancer of different sleep patterns. ""These are interesting findings that provide further evidence of how our body clock and our natural sleep preference is implicated in the onset of breast cancer."" The findings have been published on researchers' website bioRxiv but have not yet gone through scientific peer review.  Follow James on Twitter.",,,,

Has the presenter just got fickle friends, or does being vegan really affect more than your diet? Does it have an effect on your social life too?  These vegans have told us how they navigate the issue and give tips for anyone else thinking about a plant-based diet. Amy Robson, 28, has been vegan for three years. She says: ""What usually happens when you're the vegan in your friendship group is that you end up picking the place you go. ""I think you have to take the initiative and never assume others are responsible for your food choices. Look at restaurant websites in advance so you know what you can have. And for things like barbecues, bring your own food as it's a great opportunity to engage people."" ""A lot of it is fear of unfamiliar cuisine, as if someone told you, 'I'm only eating Jamaican food from now on' and you didn't know much about it. ""I really try to demystify it. There are only two things I won't eat, animals and things that come from animals.""  Amy, who spoke at last weekend's VegFest in London, adds: ""People tend to think 'well, where CAN you eat?' but the answer is 'pretty much anywhere'. You can even go into places like Wetherspoons, Domino's and Beefeater now.""  Ellie Brown says Chiles's comments are saddening and definitely don't reflect her own experience. ""But I have to caveat that by saying that I live in east London, which is very vegan friendly,"" she goes on.   ""What helps is that there are lots of places with lovely vegan options. And some friends are really up for the challenge of cooking something vegan."" Ellie, who's the founder of Kinda Co, which makes vegan cashew-based cheeses, adds: ""It probably depends on how you go about your change in dietary habits.  ""I know some people will be very outspoken about being vegan and might admonish someone for eating a steak, which is like having a go at someone for their political beliefs. It's not very nice to go for dinner with someone who tells you off.""   Gemma Tomlinson, 33, who has written a vegan recipe book, says that when it comes to eating out vegan as part of a group, just be friendly, polite and accept ""there will be rare occasions you have to cobble together a meal from starters and sides.""  ""I'm happy to do that if I'm in good company and I've yet to go hungry."" Gemma says the trickiest places are ""traditionally British"" - where the choice is dominated by steaks, roast dinners and pies. ""This is never my choice of restaurant anyway but I imagine that if Adrian Chiles is used to choosing these kinds of establishments when in company, he might struggle!""  Veganism seems to elicit strong feelings in some - Waitrose Food magazine editor William Sitwell quit the post on Wednesday after saying vegans should be ""killed... one by one"". While not that extreme, Gemma agrees there can be difficult conversations with non-vegans, adding: ""It sometimes does feel like you're on the witness stand and faced with a lot of questions. ""These situations can easily escalate to the point that a nice family meal ends up sounding more like a talk radio phone-in, all because you ordered some tofu pad thai.""  PR consultant Claire Rees went vegan after becoming a mum when she found it difficult to teach her son compassion, and about different animals, and then go on to ""serve them up as food"".  In her words, ""eating out isn't what it used to be"". ""It was a big part of my friendship group, the shared love of food - and roasts on a Sunday. Now we tend to cook more at home.  ""If we're going out, we'll need to research restaurants and go where we know will cater well for us. I've had my fair share of lacklustre salads or dishes where they've just taken out the meat and not replaced it.""

1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45942574,"Scientists are working on a new antibiotic that has produced promising results in early trials. Medicine will need more of these in coming years if increasing bacterial resistance is not to pose a very serious threat to human health. When they were introduced, in the 1940s, antibiotics were hailed as a ""wonder drug"". But there are major concerns that over-prescription has led to increasing resistance to the drugs.  Last week, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, went as far as to say we were ""at risk of putting medicine back in the dark ages"" - but why has this happened? Scottish chemist Alexander Fleming discovered the first true antibiotic, penicillin, in 1928, as a mould on a petri dish that inhibited the growth of bacteria. His discovery revolutionised the treatment of certain types of bacterial infection, saving countless lives in the process. Antibiotics fight bacteria in a number of ways, including by killing them or preventing them from spreading. However, they also have a major weakness.  Antibiotics are very effective at killing most, but not all, bacteria. Some bacteria acquire genes that protect them from the drug's attack.  They survive treatment and reproduce themselves, spreading the key genes more widely so the drug becomes ever less effective.  If somebody is infected by these drug-resistant bacteria, then it can become harder to deploy antibiotics to treat them successfully.  At present other types of antibiotic might do the trick but the options are starting to narrow as bacteria develop the ability to block more than one drug. In the past four years in England, there has been a 35% increase in antibiotic-resistant blood infections. This is because there have been greater efforts by clinicians and other health professionals to identify sepsis cases. However, even though the absolute number of infections being detected has increased, the relative proportion of blood infections resistant to antibiotics has remained stable. From the point of view of health experts, a key to reduce antibiotic-resistant blood infections is to ensure that resistant bacteria cannot become prevalent in the first place.  A recent report highlights that without effective antibiotics, life-threatening infections linked to operations such as hip replacements and Caesarean sections could increase.   Since 2013, Public Health England has actively been campaigning to reduce the amount of antibiotics taken by patients.  They say that over-prescription of antibiotics is a major cause of the increase in resistance to them. This is because the more antibiotics are used are used, the less effective they become. In addition, GPs have been prescribing antibiotics to patients who are not infected with bacterial diseases, even though they will never work. Antibiotic consumption in England has decreased by about 5% since 2013 - but the average daily dose per 1,000 people varies across the country.  Public Health England points out that antibiotic resistance and prescription are ""inextricably linked - areas with high levels of antibiotic prescribing also have high levels of resistance"". Its campaign involves ensuring all areas have access to best practices for using antibiotics - in particular in community care, as 90% of antibiotics are prescribed by GPs.  They want to see patients and carers educated about the inappropriate use of antibiotics and greater efforts by health professionals in preventing infections in the first place. And in 2016 the government called for a 50% reduction in the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics by 2021. About half of all patients with a cough or cold leave their GP's surgery with a prescription for antibiotics.  And there are concerns that patient expectations are driving the problem.  Recent research suggests 38% of people expect to be prescribed antibiotics when they go to the doctor.  So efforts are now being made not only to reduce the number of antibiotics prescribed but also for GPs not to prescribe antibiotics for conditions that will naturally clear up by themselves after a few days. Over-prescription is not a problem unique to the UK.  The European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network has called the spread of drug-resistant bacteria a ""public health threat"", with estimates suggesting that 25,000 people die in Europe from linked infections every year. Currently, the UK has below average consumption compared with other EU countries.  Efforts to mitigate future costs related to the problem have led countries with high consumption to learn from others - in particular in northern Europe - who consume fewer antibiotics.  One of the biggest global concerns regarding antibiotics is over drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), TB remains the world's deadliest infectious disease. Treatment has been effective, with an estimated 54 million lives saved through diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2017. Even so, and with the global incidence of TB falling at about 2% per year, it remains one of top 10 causes of death worldwide. In 2017, 10 million people fell ill with TB and 1.6 million died from the disease, mainly in developing countries. The WHO says that 490,000 people have multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), when bacteria do not respond to the two most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. Second-line drugs can treat and cure MDR-TB. However, such treatment options can mean that patients have to undergo up to two years of chemotherapy involving costly and toxic medicines. It has been 30 years since a new class of antibiotic became available. And resistance has developed to all those that do exist. But antibiotics are expensive to produce and can take a long time to become available to clinicians and patients. In 2017, Public Health England warned that a failure to address resistance to antibiotics could lead to an estimated 10 million deaths every year globally by 2050 at a cost of ¬£66trillion in lost productivity to the global economy. That is why they, and other health organisations, are calling for a reduction in the overuse and misuse of antibiotics.",,,,

Children were responsible for the vast majority of cases - 95% of objects removed from noses and 85% from ears. Annually an average of 1,218 nasal and 2,479 aural removals took place between 2010 and 2016, data shows. Jewellery was the most common foreign object requiring removal from children, while in adults, cotton buds proved to be the leading problem. The paper, titled Will Children Ever Learn? is published in the The Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons. England's Hospital Episode Statistics show children aged one to four were the most likely to seek help for a foreign body in the nose.  Five to nine year olds attended A&E with something in their ear the most. Jewellery items accounted for up to 40% of cases in both the ear and noses of children. Paper and plastic toys were the items removed next most from noses, with cotton buds and pencils also found in  ears. The study said: ""The occurrence of foreign bodies in children is generally attributed to curiosity, a whim to explore orifices and accidental entry of the foreign body."" Its author, Dr Simon Morris, a specialist at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, said: ""Ask any ear, nose and throat surgeon, and they'll be able to tell you about weird and wonderful objects they have retrieved from the noses and ears of children and adults - pretty much anything that fits. ""Personally I've seen green peas, 'googly eyes' and polystyrene balls from bean-bags."" He said batteries can pose a particular danger. He added: ""Obviously prevention is better than a cure, which is why many toys contain warnings about containing small parts... But otherwise, recognising this early and seeking medical attention is important.""",,,,

In the fiscal year 2016/7 up to March, 250 children from elementary to high school age were recorded as having taken their own lives. The number is five more than last year, and the highest it has been since 1986. Concerns the children had reported included family problems, worrying about their futures and bullying. But schools said the reasons behind about 140 of the deaths are unknown as the students did not leave a note. Most of those who took their lives were of high school age, where Japanese students typically study until they are aged 18. A report released by Japan's Cabinet Office in 2015 looked at child suicide data in the country from 1972-2013, which recognised a massive peak at the start of the second term of the school year on 1 September.  Japan had one of the highest suicide rates in 2015 but since preventative measures were introduced, the figures have dropped, according to World Health Organization. Overall suicides across Japan fell to about 21,000 in 2017, police say, down from a peak of about 34,500 in 2003. However, child suicide rates remain relatively high - making it the leading cause of death among young people in the country.  ""The number of suicides of students have stayed high, and that is an alarming issue which should be tackled,"" education ministry official Noriaki Kitazaki said as the latest figures were released.

Some 500 ambulances had already gathered in Paris before rush hour on Monday as part of a day of action. A new regulation means that hospitals and clinics - rather than individual patients - will now choose which ambulance service to use. Many small operators say that means they will no longer be able to compete. French media report that up to 2,000 ambulances are expected in total throughout the day. News outlet France Bleu reported that there were some 400km (250 miles) of traffic jams in the Ile-de-France region by 09:00 local time (08:00 GMT). The A4 motorway was also affected. Video of the protests posted on social media showed a small army of vehicles at a near standstill on the usually busy main road - each with their lights flashing and sirens on. Many bore messages against the controversial reforms on their sides and windows, and some paramedics left their vehicles to walk down the road bearing placards. Police also arrived at the scene in an attempt to clear the blockages. The action is scheduled to continue until about 16:00, when the paramedics are due to meet in front of the ministry of health. The reform of ambulance and other health-related transport came into effect on 1 October, which changed the way paramedics were paid for their work. Instead of patients choosing their provider, hospitals and other medical facilities will arrange transport for patients and pay for it. Many small independent firms say they will not be able to compete in a public tender process against much larger operations, which may offer bulk discounts. One paramedic, speaking to BFMTV, said that his firm was already receiving far fewer calls than it used to.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-45879034,"Catherine Benfield wasn't diagnosed with OCD until she was 31, after she had her first child, though it would appear she's had it all her life. She recovered with the help of therapy - and by creating a character who personifies her obsessive-compulsive behaviour. ""She's got the big ears, because she's like a startled hare, she's listening out. ""She's bedraggled, because she's been through a lot and she's normally having some kind of panic. ""The big eyes are about making sure she's keeping an eye out for danger. ""The big legs - for running,"" like a frightened hare, says Catherine Benfield. And she can change too - very quickly. She can be quiet one moment, but then her mood will swing and she'll suddenly be feeling at the end of her tether, forlorn, broken and, at her worst, absolutely beaten. You have now met Olivia. She is a visualisation - a character created by Catherine to personify the condition she has lived with since she was a child. The O in Olivia stands for OCD, an abbreviation for obsessive-compulsive disorder. People are often mistaken about OCD, Catherine says. So many people think it's about being very fastidious and organising your pens very precisely on your desk but it's actually a serious anxiety-related mental health condition, involving intrusive obsessive thoughts, images and fears. In an effort to prevent one of her fears coming true, Catherine would feel compelled to carry out a repetitive physical or mental act - in technical terms the fear is the ""obsession"" and the repetitive act is the ""compulsion"". This would provide temporary relief from the anxiety, but then it might return, compelling her to repeat the behaviour again and again. Catherine says OCD often preys on kind and caring people. ""They're compassionate, they're sensitive to the needs of others,"" she says. ""They love the people around them to an intensity where they will do anything to stop harm coming to them."" Between the ages of four and five, Catherine would stand staring out of the window for long periods, waiting for family members to return home and fearing that they had come to harm. ""I thought somehow the silent vigil would help bring them home safely,"" she says. As a teenager she was terrified to be the last one to leave the house, because of the fear that it would burn down once she had gone - she would compulsively check the cooker was switched off and switches unplugged. And to ensure everyone was safe she would compulsively lock all doors and windows, and remove all trip hazards. These routines could take hours to perform, and if one thing disturbed the process she would start all over again. As time went on she became so busy with her studies and her job as a teacher that OCD had less of an impact on her life. It wasn't until she had her baby son at the age of 31 that she became really unwell. ""I had a horrible labour. I came away, I was very weak and I just couldn't do very much physically, it gave me a lot of time to think,"" she says. ""Almost immediately I started staying up all night to check he was breathing. Every parent has been known to check their child's breathing, particularly when it's newborn, but it grew to the point where I didn't feel like I could leave him at all. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating."" At first she was terrified that something or someone would hurt him. Then she began to worry that she might harm him herself. ""I remember sitting on the sofa looking at my mother-in-law holding my kid in front of a wall and thinking how easy it would be to get up and throw him against it,"" she says. ""I could see it all, it was absolutely horrible and really detailed, very vivid, accompanied with images in my head of my future and what I'd have done to my family and my friends as a result."" She didn't know it, but what she was experiencing was perinatal OCD. Women with this condition would never actually carry out the actions they visualise, but Catherine's intrusive thoughts left her feeling anxious, depressed and isolated. ""I didn't know it was OCD,"" she says. ""I thought I wanted to do it. I thought, 'What kind of mother has thoughts like that about their child?'"" Consultant psychiatrist Dr Lynne Drummond says life events, both good and bad, are often a trigger for OCD. ""Childbirth is quite a major life event,"" she says. ""Let alone the whole issue of suddenly having somebody who is completely and utterly dependent on you. Plus your [changing] hormones, plus you're knackered and you're probably at times down in the dumps and your body has had a huge change. You're physically at a lower ebb. Emotionally you have to come to grips with your change in role."" Catherine began to avoid anything that could hurt her son. She threw away all the knives in the house as she imagined herself hurting him with them. She was terrified to go on a station platform with the pram after having intrusive thoughts about pushing her son under a train. She eventually became so anxious that she couldn't leave the house with her son. ""I was never suicidal, but I do remember at one point thinking, if the very worst comes to the very worst and I can't get through this, that is an option for me,"" she says. ""If you believe that you're a danger to your child, you'll do whatever you can to remove that danger and that was, I suppose, the ultimate thing that I could do."" She says no-one - including medical professionals - recognised her symptoms. ""I literally got to the point where my husband said, 'You need to come to the doctor's right now,' and so we went,"" says Catherine. ""I walked in and I was literally like, 'I'm worried I'm going to harm my son,' and just burst into tears."" The GP told her it was anxiety and gave her medication. But when she tried to come off it her condition deteriorated again. One day, in desperation, she typed into Google ""OCD and fear of harming son"" and dozens of stories popped up. ""I hadn't thought that was going to happen,"" she says. ""I thought I was a monster, and immediately everything that I had been thinking and feeling and going through was written down in front of me by all these other people."" Catherine had finally got a diagnosis - from the internet - after battling with OCD all her life. She then sought medical help, and about 18 months after she had her son Catherine started therapy. This included cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a talking therapy which focuses on how your thoughts and attitudes affect your behaviour and feelings, and exposure and response prevention therapy (ERP), a form of CBT treatment where you are asked to confront your obsessions or fears and resist carrying out the compulsive behaviour. What I'd do is get the patient to create a hierarchy of situations. I use a zero-to-eight scale with zero being no anxiety and eight complete panic. I'd get them to rate how anxious they would feel doing each thing without ""putting things right"" - in other words, performing the compulsion. I'd start with something that had an anxiety rating of three or four - mild-to-moderate anxiety - and encourage them to expose themselves to their fears for one to two hours without ""putting things right"". They would find that the anxiety would remain high and it would be absolutely horrible, but actually over that time it would go down - and each time they do it will be just that little bit easier. This helped enormously, but Catherine found there was a big stumbling block on her road to recovery. ""Unless I could get a handle on the fact that actually I wasn't this monster, I wasn't going to be able to carry on getting better,"" she says. ""And that's where Olivia came in.""  Olivia was a way for Catherine to separate herself from her condition. Olivia personified her obsessions and her compulsive behaviour - but she could feel compassion for Olivia, and this enabled her to feel compassion for herself.  ""If I had a really horrible thought about harming someone, I would imagine that it was Olivia hopping up and down and she was the one who was frightened, she was the one who was scared - and I'd feel for her. ""I'd be like, 'Come on don't be daft, this is just anxiety,' and by doing that I could then talk to myself in that way",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46118103,"There has been a remarkable global decline in the number of children women are having, say researchers.  Their report found fertility rate falls meant nearly half of countries were now facing a ""baby bust"" - meaning there are insufficient children to maintain their population size. The researchers said the findings were a ""huge surprise"". And there would be profound consequences for societies with ""more grandparents than grandchildren"". The study, published in the Lancet, followed trends in every country from 1950 to 2017. In 1950, women were having an average of 4.7 children in their lifetime. The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year.  But that masks huge variation between nations.  The fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average.  In the UK, the rate is 1.7, similar to most Western European countries. The total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in their lifetime (it's different to the birth rate which is the number of children born per thousand people each year). Whenever a country's rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (this ""baby bust"" figure is significantly higher in countries which have high rates of death in childhood). At the start of the study, in 1950, there were zero nations in this position. Prof Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: ""We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries. ""It's a remarkable transition. ""It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people."" More economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates. It does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration. It can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold.  But Prof Murray said: ""We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population.""  Half the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates. Rachael Jacobs, 38, of Kent, had her first and only child seven years ago I'd always focused on my career. When I was pregnant I was still focusing on my career.  I know now that we can survive on what we earn as a family and still go on holiday every year. If we had more than one child we couldn't go on holiday.  We'd rather give our daughter the best of everything than have multiple children that we can just about feed and clothe.  My partner and I are also thinking about the future. We want to be in a position where we can help her financially with university or housing. I don't want to ever have to say that she can't go to a party or have a new Christmas jumper. The fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility.  Instead it is being put down to three key factors: In many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story. Without migration, countries will face ageing and shrinking populations. Dr George Leeson, director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, says that does not have to be a bad thing, as long as the whole of society adjusts to the massive demographic change.  He told the BBC: ""Demography impacts on every single aspect of our lives, just look out of your window at the people on the streets, the houses, the traffic, the consumption, it is all driven by demography. ""Everything we plan for is not just driven by the numbers in the population, but also the age structure and that is changing, so fundamentally we haven't got our heads around it."" He thinks workplaces are going to have to change and even the idea of retiring at 68, the current maximum in the UK, will be unsustainable.  The report, part of the Global Burden of Diseases analysis, says affected countries will need to consider increasing immigration, which can create its own problems, or introducing policies to encourage women to have more children, which often fail. Report author Prof Murray argues: ""On current trends there will be very few children and lots of people over the age of 65 and that's very difficult to sustain global society. ""Think of all the profound social and economic consequences of a society structured like that with more grandparents than grandchildren. ""I think Japan is very aware of this, they're facing declining populations, but I don't think it's hit many countries in the West, because low fertility has been compensated with migration. ""At a global level there is no migration solution,"" Prof Murray says. But while the change may challenge societies, it may also have environmental benefits given the impact of our species. China has seen huge population growth since 1950, going from around half a billion inhabitants to 1.4 billion. But it too is facing the challenge of fertility rates, which stood at only 1.5 in 2017, and has recently moved away from its famous one child policy.  The reason developed countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 is because not all children survive to adulthood and babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male than female. But in China, the report shows for every 100 girls born there were 117 boys which ""imply very substantial sex-selective abortion and even the possibility of female infanticide"".  That means even more children need to be born to have a stable population. Follow James on Twitter.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46109023,"The amount of time children spend on devices has little effect on how long they sleep, a study from Oxford University suggests. It runs counter to previous research that suggested excessive screen time was linked to children failing to get sufficient rest. The survey concluded that the relationship between sleep and screen use in children was ""extremely modest"".  But one UK GP said the findings did not tally with his clinical experience. The study, conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute, relied on data from a 2016 US study into children's health, in which parents from across the country completed surveys about their households.  The children's ""digital screen time"" was based on answers to two questions about the weekday habits of children aged between six months and 17 years: The findings indicate that the tech-abstaining teenagers slept only slightly longer than their counterparts who had spent much of their day in front of a screen. For example, teenagers who had not been in front of a screen for any part of the day got a total of eight hours and 51 minutes of sleep.  Those who had spent eight hours of their day glued to a screen got eight hours and 21 minutes of slumber. The sample size for the survey was more than 50,000 youngsters from every state in the US. The study, published in the Journal of Pediatrics, said every hour of screen time was linked to between three to eight fewer minutes of sleep a night.  Screens are now a fixture of modern childhood and both professionals and parents are increasingly expressing concerns that the amount of time children devote to devices affects their physical and mental health. When it comes to sleep, there are concerns that children take devices to bed and continue to use them when they should be sleeping. Others have expressed worries about the role the blue light emitted from such devices plays on sleep habits and a related hormone. The US National Sleep Foundation has told parents that it is important to stop children using electronic devices before bedtime ""because the blue light emitted from these screens can delay the release of sleep-inducing melatonin"". ""This is an especially big problem for teens whose circadian rhythms are already shifting naturally, causing them to feel awake later at night. The end result: sleep-deprived or poorly rested kids who have essentially given themselves a mini case of jet lag,"" it writes on its website. But the study author thinks other factors should be considered. ""Focusing on bedtime routines and regular patterns of sleep, such as consistent wake-up times, are much more effective strategies for helping young people sleep than thinking screens themselves play a significant role,"" said study author Prof Andrew Przbylski. Prof Przbylski told the BBC that many of the studies suggesting links between screen time and lack of sleep had very small sample sizes and need ""much larger studies"" to find conclusive evidence of a problem. ""Because the effects of screens are so modest, it is possible that many studies with smaller sample sizes could be false positives - results that support an effect that in reality does not exist,"" he said. He acknowledged that the data used in the study was ""imperfect"" because it relied on reports from parents. A further study into the time that children turn off their devices before bedtime will be published shortly. Many of the large technology firms, including Apple, Google and Facebook, have introduced dashboards allowing people to keep a check on the amount of time they spend on screens. Some leading technology executives have banned their own children from using devices.  The late Apple chief Steve Jobs's young children were notably not allowed iPads. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates banned phones until his children were teenagers. And Tim Cook, Apple's current leader, has said he would not let his nephew join social networks. One UK GP, Rangan Chatterjee, said the Oxford University study was ""welcome"" but that he did not plan to change his advice to parents, which was to turn off devices an hour before bedtime. ""The more research on this area, the better because screens are here to stay,"" he told the BBC. ""But the findings don't replicate what I see in clinical practice which is that the use of screens right before bed has a significant impact on the quality of sleep.""",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46130278,"Women who smoke, have diabetes or high blood pressure increase their risk of a heart attack more than men faced with the same risks, a large study of UK adults has found.  The researchers, writing in the BMJ, said women should receive the same treatments as men and be offered support to stop smoking. Doctors should also be better at spotting female patients at risk. Men are still three times more likely than women to have a heart attack. The study, led by Oxford University researchers, tracked nearly 500,000 people aged 40-69  enrolled in the UK Biobank database. Over seven years, 5,081 people had their first heart attack and one in three of them were women. Although the risk of having a heart attack is lower in women than in men of all ages, certain risk factors appeared to have a greater impact on women. Women who smoked were three times more likely to have a heart attack than women who did not smoke - but in men, smoking only doubled their risk.  High blood pressure increased a woman's risk by an extra 83% relative to its effect in a man. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes both had a greater impact on the heart attack risk of women compared to men, the study found. The researchers say they do not know why these factors are sex-specific, and no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, but they do have some theories. Biological factors may be a reason. For example, type 2 diabetes, which is usually linked to poor diet and lifestyle factors, may have a different impact on the female heart to the male one. But the study says women often don't realise they are at risk of heart disease and they may also be on the receiving end of poorer care and treatment from doctors. In an accompanying editorial, the researchers say men may be more prone to heart attacks, but heart disease is the biggest killer of women in the UK. Although the chest pain is often severe, some people may feel only minor pain, similar to indigestion. In some cases, there may not be any chest pain at all, especially in women, the elderly and people with diabetes. Source: NHS Choices Dr Elizabeth Millett, lead study author and an epidemiologist at the George Institute for Global Health, University of Oxford, said: ""Heart disease also affects women and this needs to be recognised. ""Women need to be aware they're at risk, but despite lots of campaigns, it's still under the radar of most women. ""It's a complicated, long-term thing to work out, probably caused by a combination of factors - both biological and social,"" she said. She said, in the future, with an ageing population, women could start to have a similar overall rate of heart attacks to men. And the authors said women with diabetes, high blood pressure and who smoke, ""should be considered at a level of risk comparable to many men"".",,,,

According to figures from the British Transport Police, 2018 has seen a 20% rise in members of the public intervening to stop people killing themselves on railways. In May, while out walking her dog, Gillian became one of those people. ""At first I didn't know what it was,"" she tells the BBC, recounting her journey back home past the bridge. ""But as we got closer, I realised it was a person. ""They were crying, hysterically crying and making noises."" At that moment, Gillian decided to investigate, but it would not be until months later that she would realise the true impact of her actions. ""I knew I had to have a plan,"" says Gillian.  She feared the man might be aggressive, either verbally or physically, but says she knew that, no matter what, she ""wasn't going to walk past him"". Slowly, with her dog, she approached and called out to ask if the man ""was OK"". ""No I'm not,"" he shouted back. ""I could see that he was in a really bad state,"" says Gillian. ""He was angry but he was crying as well."" She says she decided ""she was going to be brave"" and approach him. Gillian persuaded him to sit down with her on the Tarmac in the middle of the bridge with ""him on one side, me on the other and the dog in between us"". From experience of her daughter's anxiety, Gillian knew of the importance of ""grounding"", so began to ask basic questions such as his name and where he was from to ""break his emotion"". His name was Tommy. He was 23 years old. After ""10 or 15 minutes"", Tommy began to calm down but was ""still monosyllabic"".  At that point, a train passed below them. It made Gillian wonder whether he ""would have gone"" if she had not been there. If you or someone you know is struggling with issues raised by this story, find support through BBC Action Line . Tommy told Gillian why he was on the bridge, but that, she says, is a matter that will remain between them. Eventually, she persuaded Tommy to call his parents and let them know where he was. She waited until they arrived - about 25 minutes after she first approached Tommy - then retreated. ""I was a bit blown away, thinking: 'Did that just happen?'"" Gillian only spoke to her mother and a friend about her experience - but later in the year realised people she had never met were discussing her story online. One Sunday morning, her husband showed her a Facebook post. It began: ""I know I'm asking the impossible, and I know this is like looking for a needle in a haystack, but four months ago I tried to take my life and and a stranger stopped me with her dog..."" As she read the post, Gillian realised she was the stranger.  She decided not to reply on the thread - ""I thought, it's not about me and it shouldn't be about me. It was about him."" Her husband sent Tommy a private message, explaining the stranger was his wife. The pair spoke on the phone that day. Three days later they arranged to meet in a local pub. ""I saw him walking from the other side of the pub, he flung his arms around me and I thought: 'Bless him.'"" He clung to her for more than a minute, saying: ""You saved my life. You saved my life."" They spent an hour together, which Gillian describes as ""special"". ""Since then we've walked the dog a few times and we're in contact two or three times a week,"" she says. ""It is the most overwhelming feeling I've ever had, other than giving birth. ""He's in my heart now. The bond is there and it is unbelievable.  ""It's a very unusual bond - it's not spiritual, it's just an invisible and not tangible thing in my heart.""

The 15-month-old girls, Nima and Dawa Pelden, had been joined at the torso and shared a liver. Lead surgeon Dr Joe Crameri told reporters the girls had coped ""very well"" with the six-hour operation.  Dr Crameri said it was a ""joy"" to inform their mother, Bhumchu Zangmo, that the surgery had been a success. ""There's nothing better in any operation to be able to go to the parents and say we have been able to take care of your child,"" he said.  Nima and Dawa had grown facing each other, and could not sit down together. They could stand but only at the same time. The twins were brought to Melbourne with their mother last month, but doctors had delayed the surgery until Friday, to improve the girls' nutrition needs.  About 18 specialists in two teams, one for each girl, took part in the procedure at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital.  Doctors successfully divided the twins' liver. The girls were found not to share a bowel - something surgeons had said was an ""unknown"" before the operation. ""We always felt confident that we could achieve this,"" Dr Crameri said. ""But we just did not know what we would find."" But he said there ""weren't any things inside the girls' tummies that we weren't really prepared for"". ""There will be challenges over the next 24 to 48 hours as with any surgery, and we feel quietly confident that we will have a good result,"" he said. Conjoined twins are very rare - it is thought one in every 200,000 births - and around 40-60% of these births are delivered stillborn.  Only a few separations are carried out around the world each year. The Bhutanese family was brought to Australia by Children First Foundation, an Australian-based charity.  Elizabeth Lodge, from the charity, said Ms Zangmo had felt ""a little bit scared"", but had shown ""extraordinary calmness"" before the procedure.  The charity said the girls were breathing on their own.   ""Bhumchu has seen her girls and given each a kiss‚Ä¶ each sleeping apart for the first time,"" it said in a statement.  The state of Victoria has offered to cover the A$350,000 (¬£195,000; $255,000) cost of the operation. The family is expected to return to the Himalayan kingdom, one of the world's poorest nations, after the twins have recovered.

Now the first babies are being born at the world's first clinic that helps heart attack survivors to have a baby.  Hayley Martin, 47, vividly remembers the morning her life changed forever. ""I woke up and I felt very, very poorly. I put my hands to my head and I was drenched in sweat. I knew straight away it was a heart attack,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. She was a healthy 38-year-old when she had a Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD), a rare and often undiagnosed condition.  It is the leading cause of heart attacks in women of childbearing age, affecting around 1,000 women a year.  It occurs when there is a sudden tear in one of the coronary arteries, blocking the flow of blood to the heart. In hospital, Hayley, from Congleton in Cheshire, feared the worst.  ""I can remember saying to them, 'am I dying?' And they just kept saying, 'we've tried everything we can, but nothing is working,'"" she said.  She survived, but like many women with SCAD, was told pregnancy would mean the risk of another heart attack. ""I think it was another thing that was stolen from me, so I almost don't allow myself to think about it, because it could take you down a dark path of sadness,"" Hayley reflected. ""I felt less of a person, less of a woman, more of a failure, like I was faulty."" Source: Leicester Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit Hayley is the kind of woman who consultant cardiologist Dr Abi Al-Hussaini is trying to help, with her clinic at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.  Dr Al-Hussaini assesses the damage done to the heart by the SCAD and reviews the patient's medication, generally lowering the amount they are on.  She uses that information to advise the patient how risky a pregnancy could be. This does mean sometimes she has to advise that the risk to health might be very high, but the key is the patient makes the decision, rather than the usual blanket advice not to get pregnant.     If one of her patients decides to proceed, they are referred to the pre-existing ""high risk pregnancy team"" at the hospital, who monitor them throughout the pregnancy.  ""I have seen a lot of patients over the last few years who have come to me unhappy that they have been told they cannot have a child ever again,"" she explained. ""That's one of the reasons I established the clinic, to give these patients the correct advice and allow them to make an informed decision themselves."" She believes a lack of research into the condition is why most cardiologists prefer the blanket advice.      One of the first women helped by the clinic was Julie Murphy, 40, from Ruislip.  Shortly before her honeymoon in 2013, she started to feel unwell, like she had flu. While on holiday in Kenya, the symptoms got worse.  Then, while swimming, she had a sharp pain in her chest. When she got home, she had tests on her heart and, ""the next day I found out I'd had a heart attack"". The days and weeks that followed were very tough. ""All the medication I was on really slowed me down so I couldn't even walk up the stairs when I came home from hospital. That was really difficult to get my head around,"" she says. Like Hayley, Julie was initially told she would not be able to have children. But she became part of a research project led by Dr Al-Hussaini and had her first daughter, Holly, in 2015. She then became one of the clinic's first patients when she became pregnant for a second time.  ""I was worried that they would say there's no possibility or it would be too dangerous for us to try to have a baby, that it might mean that I'm putting my life at risk,"" she said.  Bella was born in April. ""They're such an awesome team that you felt so looked after,"" Julie said.   Despite the hope she is giving patients, Dr Al-Hussaini says she has encountered resistance from doctors around the world, in terms of what advice they give their patients.  ""In America, they are against becoming pregnant any time after a heart attack, or having had a spontaneous coronary artery dissection,"" she said. ""But again, I think that's because there hasn't been a huge amount of research - but there is a growing amount of research at the moment that's been developed.""

Then when I got to university I began to faint frequently, my hair was falling out, I had severe joint pains and was constantly tired. My Mum thought it was down to my hectic student lifestyle.""  A visit to her GP and two blood tests for iron levels revealed that she was suffering from genetic haemochromatosis or GH - a genetic condition which causes iron to overload in the body.  Most of us think of iron as a strength-giver and worry more about iron deficiency. There is little awareness of the risks of iron overload, and confusingly some of the symptoms, like fatigue, can be the same.  Says Katherine: ""I was very lucky to get a quick diagnosis. A lot of health professionals believe women do not show symptoms until much later in life, which can then lead to potential organ damage. ""In the last year, I have had about 30 hospital and health visits. Today I suffer from chronic fatigue, IBS, and joint pains in my knees, hands and elbows. The only treatment for this is venesection, where I have a pint of blood removed every few months.  ""I do feel lucky that I was diagnosed young as it allows me to monitor my health. Some days I am in excruciating pain, other days I am fine. But there needs to be more awareness of this condition."" Source: Haemochromatosis UK A recent report by the charity Haemochromatosis UK (HUK) surveyed 2,000 people with the condition worldwide.  It found that 73% of patients suffered with psychological difficulties, 81% experienced fatigue and 87% experienced arthritis or joint pain.  Although most were satisfied with their treatment by specialists, about a third highlighted that information and support from GPs was poor.  The report was launched at the House of Commons, where MPs, campaigners and patients gathered to help raise awareness of the condition.  Dr Edward Fitzsimons, consultant haematologist, University of Glasgow, said: ""Haemochromatosis is one of the most frequent genetic disorders found in North European populations.  ""Yet it is a condition that all too easily escapes diagnosis.  ""For every one patient diagnosed, there are some eight to 10 who are undiagnosed.  ""It is without doubt the most common condition you have never heard of."" Abigail Harvey, 19, was diagnosed with haemochromatosis at just 15.  Up to that point she had suffered from severe period pain cramps and joint pain as well as depression. Aged 14 she was taken to hospital for attempting suicide.  ""A lovely counsellor I was seeing suggested I get thorough blood tests.  ""I had severe pains all over my body, and felt like an aching old lady rather than a young teen.  ""Everyone around me thought I was anaemic, but it turned out I was suffering from too much iron.  ""Many doctors I was seeing asked me to explain my condition! Why is it that so much is known about anaemia but not its evil cousin?"" Since diagnosis, Abigail has been treated with blood removal, with limited success. ""I can't stress enough to ask your doctor to check your iron levels if you experience any of these symptoms,"" she said.  David Head, chief executive of Haemochromatosis UK, said: ""Abigail's story of menstrual problems, joint pains, mental health issues, delayed diagnosis and the tribulations of treatment will resonate with many patients. ""We cannot stress enough how important it is that healthcare professionals are as aware of iron overload as they are of iron deficiency, and test properly when patients describe these problems.""

Scientists used ultrasound scanners to look at blood vessels in the necks of more than 3,000 people and monitored them over the next 15 years. They found those with the most intense pulses went on to experience greater cognitive decline over the next decade than the other study participants. Researchers hope it may offer a new way to predict cognitive decline. An international team of experts, led by University College London (UCL), measured the intensity of the pulse travelling towards the brain in 3,191 people in 2002. A more intense pulse can cause damage to the small vessels of the brain, structural changes in the brain's blood vessel network and minor bleeds known as mini-strokes. Over the next 15 years, researchers monitored participants' memory and problem-solving ability.  Those with the highest intensity pulse (the top quarter of participants) at the beginning of the study were about 50% more likely to show accelerated cognitive decline over the next decade compared with the rest of the participants, the study found.  Researchers said this was the equivalent of about an extra one to one-and-half years of decline. Cognitive decline is often one of the first signs of dementia, but not everyone who experiences it will go on to develop the condition. Researchers said the test could provide a new way to identify people who are at risk of developing dementia, leading to earlier treatments and lifestyle interventions. Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, having a healthy diet, doing regular exercise and not smoking can all help to stave off dementia, evidence suggests. Dr Scott Chiesa, from UCL, said: ""Dementia is the end result of decades of damage, so by the time people get dementia it's too late to do anything.  ""What we're trying to say is you need to get in as early as possible, identify a way to see who's actually progressing towards possibly getting dementia and target them."" However, the study, co-funded by the British Heart Foundation, does not contain data on which study participants went on to develop dementia. Researchers next plan to use MRI scans to check if people in the study also display structural and functional changes within the brain that may explain their cognitive decline. They also want to test whether the scan improves predictive risk scores for dementia which already exist.  Dr Carol Routledge, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said it was not yet clear if the scan could improve the diagnosis of dementia. She added: ""What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia.""

Public Health England said the victim became infected after being bitten by a cat. PHE issued a reminder to travellers to avoid coming into contact with animals when in rabies-affected countries. Rabies is not found in wild or domestic animals in the UK, but five Britons became infected between 2000 and 2017 after ""animal exposures abroad"". Some species of bats in the UK can carry a rabies-like virus. According to the World Health Organization, the disease occurs in more than 150 countries and causes tens of thousands of deaths every year, mainly in Asia and Africa.  It says in up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for the transmission of the virus to humans.   The UK government says north African countries such as Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are among 139 nations where there is a high risk. PHE did not release further details about the Briton's death. It said that while there was no risk to the wider public, as a precautionary measure, health workers and close contacts of the person who died were being assessed and offered vaccination if necessary. Rabies is a viral infection that affects the brain and central nervous system. It is passed on through bites and scratches from an infected animal. There are no documented instances of it being transmitted via human to human contact.  Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, said: ""This is an important reminder of the precautions people should take when travelling to countries where rabies is present.""

It surveyed milkshakes sold in restaurants and fast food shops in the UK and found they contained ""grotesque levels of sugar and calories"". Freakshakes are milkshakes that also contain chocolates, sweets, cake, cream and sauce.  The Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake came top of the survey with 39 teaspoons of sugar or 1,280 calories. That is more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult and over six times the amount of sugar recommended for seven to 10-year-olds. In terms of sugar, it is the equivalent of drinking more than five cans of cola.  The British Heart Foundation calculates an average 25-year-old would need to jog for nearly three hours or vacuum the house for five hours to burn off the calories.  The researchers found that many other shakes contain more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult. They say that of the 46 products included in the survey with nutrition labelling available online, all would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugar per serving.   Action on Sugar, which is made up of specialists concerned with sugar and its effects on health, are calling for mandatory traffic light-coloured nutrition labelling across all menus.  The government is currently consulting on menu calorie labelling.  Public Health England (PHE) also has a sugar reduction programme as part of the government's childhood obesity plan. It is challenging businesses to cut sugar by 20% by 2020 and milkshakes are included in that.  Action on Sugar chairman Graham MacGregor, professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at London's Queen Mary University, said that does not go far enough.  ""These very high calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffering from tooth decay - that is not acceptable,"" he said. ""These high calorie milkshakes need to be reduced immediately below 300kcal per serving.""  Registered nutritionist Kawther Hashem, a researcher at Action on Sugar based at Queen Mary, said it was ""shocking this information is hidden from the consumer, who would struggle to find it"". She said it was ""time the government introduced legislation to force companies to be more transparent about what is in their products"". Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: ""The food and drink industry - including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers - has a key role in helping to tackle this, by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge."" Freakshakes were invented in Australia, but have become increasingly popular in the UK in recent years and with their photogenic qualities are a popular posting on social media.  The Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake is made with grape and raspberry flavoured ice cream, blackcurrant jelly pieces, milk, freshly whipped cream and topped with marshmallow, skittles and almond macaroon. Toby Carvery had two freakshakes in the top 10 of the survey, as did Harvester.  Both companies told the BBC that they shared their nutritional information online, took their nutritional responsibilities seriously, had committed to PHE's sugar reduction programme and also were not targeting children with their shakes. A Toby Carvery spokesperson added: ""We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes."" And a Harvester spokesperson said: ""We have also been recognised by the Soil Association Out to Lunch campaign for continuing to develop our children's menu and offering healthier choices for young guests."" Action on Sugar also looked at supermarket milkshakes and found that 90% of the 41 products surveyed would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugars.   The top three for sugars and calories were Muller Milk Frijj in chocolate, fudge brownie and cookie dough flavour.  A spokesperson for Muller said: ""We know that for health conscious consumers, the choice of reduced sugar is important, without compromising on taste. That's why we introduced a Frijj zero added sugar range.  ""Milk contains naturally occurring sugars in the form of lactose but we would stress that it is also a natural and nutrient rich product, containing essential nutrients such as protein, calcium and vitamins.""",,,,

A type of cell the body uses to destroy cancerous tissue gets clogged by fat and stops working, the team, from Trinity College Dublin, found. Obesity is the biggest preventable cause of cancer in the UK after smoking, Cancer Research UK says.  And more than one in 20 cancer cases - about 22,800 cases each year in the UK - are caused by excess body weight.  Experts already suspected fat sent signals to the body that could both damage cells, leading to cancer, and increase the number of them. Now, the Trinity scientists have been able to show, in Nature Immunology journal, how the body's cancer-fighting cells get clogged by fat. And they hope to be able to find drug treatments that could restore these ""natural killer"" cells' fighting abilities.  Prof Lydia Lynch said: ""A compound that can block the fat uptake by natural killer cells might help.  ""We tried it in the lab and found it allowed them to kill again.

Dr Leo Carlin, from the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, said: ""Although we know that obesity increases the risk of 13 different types of cancer, we still don't fully understand the mechanisms underlying the link.  ""This study reveals how fat molecules prevent immune cells from properly positioning their tumour-killing machinery, and provides new avenues to investigate treatments.

But the islands are not just beautiful. They are also a natural laboratory, providing a unique setting in which to study cures for some of the world's deadliest diseases. A collection of 18 islands and 70 islets off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, the Bijagos are home to about 30,000 people with their own language and unique traditions. They also teem with wildlife, including the rare saltwater hippopotamus and giant sea turtle, which thrive in this remote spot. But these tranquil islands are home to many serious illnesses and conditions. Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower. Malaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems. However, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them.  Medical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands. The reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness.  While this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease. The islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites.  On the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect. An island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made. While there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments.  There are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases. Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness. Trachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes.  It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation.  The disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease.  Dr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission.  Inner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present.  This might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination.  If the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community. The results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it.  Not only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world.  Trachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled. Our current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe.  Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.   Given the prevalence of malaria on the islands  - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease.  Worryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides.  This means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed.  More like this A new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites. Past treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan. In this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets. Some, the ""intervention"" islands, will also be given the drug. Others, the ""control"" islands, will not.  A team of local islanders have been trained in medical skills, such as taking blood samples and screening them for malaria.  They have also learned how to collect and identify mosquitoes, with the help of Ba, one of our field team hoping to become the first entomologist, or insect specialist,  on the islands.  Whether this drug will get rid of malaria on the islands once and for all remains to be seen.  Either way, the lessons learnt from our studies are likely to have an impact far beyond the remote Bijagos Islands.  Every study helps us to learn about the disease itself and how it is transmitted, which shapes future research.  On the islands, this can be done more quickly, with greater control and accuracy. We can see what the effects are in a defined area, reaching an entire population.  The LSHTM project will continue on the Bijagos for at least another five years, and in the meantime, its findings are likely to be used to tackle major diseases like malaria elsewhere.

But for Oli Weatherall it's a major concern along with going on flights and eating out.  The 22-year-old from Surrey has a severe peanut allergy.  When he was a child a reaction to peanut butter left him in hospital. He says his saliva thickened so much he could barely breathe. Since then his life has changed forever and after recent high-profile cases surrounding food allergies, Oli's been telling Radio 1 Newsbeat how he copes. Oli describes the first time he was rushed to hospital after eating that peanut butter as his scariest experience.  He had no idea what was happening to his body as his skin broke out in hives (swollen, pale red bumps). It's not just a simple case of avoiding eating peanuts. Even kissing a girl on a night out could be risky.  If she'd eaten a peanut or it had even been used as an ingredient in a meal, that trace could be enough. ""People have died from it,"" Oli explains.  ""It's quite a real risk, which people wouldn't think about if you didn't have allergies.  ""Unless you know someone close to you who's got an allergy, you don't really need to think about areas like foreign holidays, flying, or romantic relationships.  ""You quite often get people having a curry, then going to the pub and then going out, so it's not just having physically eaten a peanut, it's 'have you had an Indian? Have you had a kebab?'  ""I tend to avoid it really. There have been times in the past when it's ruined my night, because I've spent the whole night thinking 'Am I having a reaction?' ""I don't need the extra stress. It would be nice to not have to worry about stuff like that but it's a reality."" Eating anywhere other than at home is a problem.  While restaurants should be aware of allergens and which ones are in their food, Oli says inexperienced managers or waiting staff can make life tricky.  It means every time he's out and about for more than a few hours, he has to plan his meals precisely.  ""A lot of your life has to be planned around being able to eat safely.  ""It just removes spontaneity a bit. You have to be quite forward thinking all the time. Meal deals (such as at supermarkets) are always a good way to go, rather than trying to eat out.""  Foreign holidays aren't happening at the moment either. The 22-year-old says that's also too much of a risk. It's not just food on the plane. Any language barrier on holiday could create a lethal misunderstanding.   Oli says: ""If I did have a reaction in the air, quite a lot of people would think 'oh you've got your EpiPen, just have one of those and you'll be fine' but that's not the case."" Airlines do carry medical equipment and staff are trained in first aid. But Oli worries that's not always enough. ""If you use an EpiPen you need urgent medical attention, that's not something which is possible to do in the air. ""I went travelling with my friends around Australia and New Zealand three or four years ago. It was worth going, but when you're staying in rubbish hostels with a severe allergy you can't cook there.  ""It's not a safe environment. I ended up eating the worst diet, stuff I knew was fine for the whole trip.  ""You're on holiday, travelling and doing all these things and you're thinking constantly ahead - 'Am I sorted for tomorrow?' It's exhausting. I'm glad I did it but I wouldn't be going to do something like that again."" Natasha Ednan-Laperouse and Celia Marsh both died after eating Pret A Manger food.  Oli says it underlines why he would never be confident to eat at similar chains. ""There's not the labelling there,"" he says. ""There's not a uniform way of doing it - which gives people with allergies good information to make the choices.

1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46197271,"Scotty Hearron says he was a ""broke college student"" the first time he got paid for donating some of his blood plasma. This was a few years ago when he was at university in Oregon. Having plasma extracted eight times over a four-week period (the maximum allowed in the US) he could earn $280 (¬£216) every month. Now a 23-year-old high school teacher, he says it wasn't an experience he minded. ""You felt like you were making an impact, and it was nice to get a bit of cash on the side,"" he says. Mr Hearron adds that the other donors of plasma - the straw-coloured liquid that makes up 55% of your blood's volume - were ""generally working-class folk or fellow students"". Each plasma donation typically takes one hour, with whole blood being drawn from the patient. The plasma is then separated in a machine next to the bed, before the blood cells are returned to the person in saline solution. In countries such as the UK, where blood donation is entirely voluntary and unpaid, paying for it might seem distasteful or exploitative. But in nations such as the US, Germany, Austria, and certain provinces of Canada, people do indeed get remunerated for giving blood, and business is booming. There is in fact a huge multi-billion dollar global market in the sale of plasma. Plasma can be sold globally because unlike whole blood it has a very long shelf life. While whole blood is typically kept refrigerated and needs to be used within 42 days, plasma can be stored for up to 10 years as long as it is kept frozen. This makes it relatively easy for plasma to be shipped over the world, where the 100 or so proteins it contains are increasingly used to help treat a multitude of diseases and health conditions. Such is the growing demand for plasma, that the global market - worth $23.6bn in 2016 - is predicted to almost double to $44.3bn by 2023. The US, the world's largest exporter, now sends more than $2bn worth of plasma and related blood products overseas every month, making it the country's 12th most valuable export. In Canada, two provinces currently allow private companies to pay people for their blood plasma - Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. Canadian Plasma Resources (CPR) collects plasma from two clinics, one in each province. ""The biggest use for plasma at the moment is mainly for immunoglobulins or antibodies,"" says Barzin Bahardoust, chief executive of Canadian Plasma Resources. People with immune deficiencies can be given extra immunoglobulins, a protein molecule, to boost the levels in their bloodstream, helping them fight infections. The effects last three to four weeks. Plasma also contains clotting factors that can be used to help treat haemophilia, and albumin, a protein that can be used to help heal burns. After CRP has collected its plasma, it is placed in special containers, then sent by lorry to Montreal, or Calgary, before being flown to Frankfurt for processing. But is it ethical to pay people for their blood? Mario Macis, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, says that altruistic donation isn't enough to meet the world's growing need for plasma. ""Individuals with [a number of] diseases would die without those therapies [from paid for plasma],"" he says. Prof Macis adds that the demand for plasma is growing as more people in the developing world have access to healthcare. Robin Slonim, an economist at the University of Sydney agrees, saying that without the supply that comes from paid donors, plasma treatments would only be affordable for the rich. He adds that while Australians are not paid for blood donations, more than 50% of the plasma in the country comes from people in the US who have been financially rewarded. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Other people and organisations are very much against paying people to donate blood plasma, or other blood items. One such individual is Kat Lanteigne, executive director of Toronto-based Blood Watch. ""I oppose paid plasma all day, every day,"" she says. She says that paying for plasma ""preys on vulnerable populations"", and harms voluntary blood donation. ""As soon as you get your donor base attached to gaining money it's been proven time and time again that you can't get those donors back into the voluntary pool."" Ms Lanteigne adds that plasma should remain in the public sector, or otherwise pharmaceutical companies will be able to set prices as high as they like. She backs efforts by Canadian Independent Senator Pamela Wallin to introduce a law to ban companies from paying people in Canada for their blood. The European Union is also evaluating its current blood donation legislation in light of the ""market entry of private operators... into a traditionally non-profit orientated sector"". Meanwhile, the World Health Organization wants a move towards 100% non-remunerated blood donation in every country, saying that this is required as the foundation of a safe, sustainable blood supply"". Defenders of paying for plasma and other blood items argue that it shouldn't be viewed as mercenary, pointing to European examples. Prof Macis says that in Germany plasma donors receive ‚Ç¨27 ($30.50; ¬£23.50) a time, which is ""described as a reimbursement for lost time and transportation, and other costs"". He adds: ""And that's a lot more appealing to people, the act of donating shouldn't make anyone worse off."" Alternatively, Italy may offer a useful middle way. While it doesn't pay blood donors it gives them a paid day off to donate. This is worth ‚Ç¨150 for the average Italian worker.",,,,

The Medical Practitioners Board says it made the decision after investigating complaints that the group's adverts were promoting abortion. Abortion is illegal in Kenya unless a mother's health is in danger.  Marie Stopes says it operates within the law, offering counselling services including post-abortion care. The head of the government agency in charge of approving adverts, Ezekiel Mutua, welcomed the ban and accused the previous US government of causing moral decay in Kenya by promoting abortion.  Some Kenyans fear the ban could lead to a rise in unsafe back-street abortions.    A letter sent from the Medical Practitioners Board to Marie Stopes on Wednesday says: ""Marie Stopes Kenya is hereby directed to immediately cease and desist offering any form of abortion services in all its facilities within the republic."" Marie Stopes was also instructed to file a weekly report on all services rendered in its facilities for 60 days. The board says it acted on complaints from, among others, Ann Kioko, campaign manager at pro-life campaign group CitizenGo Africa, and Ezekiel Mutua, chief executive officer of the Kenya Film Classification Board. Mr Mutua said adverts Marie Stopes were running had ""not been approved by the board and they were unprofessional - they were almost making it look cool to have an abortion"". ""Democrats pushed the pro-abortion view and the pro-LGBT stance on us - an agenda that is alien to our own culture,"" he said. Kenya is one of 37 Commonwealth countries that have laws criminalising homosexuality. In January, US President Donald Trump banned all American funding for any organisations that support or offer abortions.  While they are common in Kenya, they are carried out ""under the radar"",  BBC Africa editor Will reports.    ""Cultural wars across the world being fought on the bodies of black people,"" was how one Kenyan medical practitioner summed up the situation as the policies of foreign governments have an impact on what Kenyan women are allowed or banned from doing.  Marie Stopes International prides itself on being the world's largest provider of contraception and safe abortion services, with more than 12,000 team members in 37 countries. Founded in 1976, it grew out of the Marie Stopes clinic in central London. The Kenyan branch of Marie Stopes has been offering reproductive services since 1985, running 22 clinics and 15 mobile outreach clinics. Its slogans include ""Children by Choice not Chance"" and ""Helping You Manage Your Options"". It is the go-to facility for women with unwanted pregnancies, according to local newspaper Sunday Nation. The organisation's country director, Ms Dana Tilson, told the paper the abortion services they were offering conformed with the constitution. ""Marie Stopes Kenya offers pregnancy crisis counselling and post-abortion care with the aim of saving the woman and promoting positive health outcomes,"" she said.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46220676,"Every blood donation ""can save up to three lives"", yet come December thousands miss vital appointments to give blood, as the festivities kick in. It can make a huge difference to patients like two-year-old Henry Alderson who needs blood transfusions every two weeks. Last year, more than 9,000 people cancelled donor appointments at short notice in the week before Christmas. When donors drop out in such numbers, bloods stocks inevitably dwindle. For Henry, from Harwich, Essex, it could mean the difference between a Christmas spent waiting up for Rudolph and crashing his toys into the tree - and a Christmas spent in bed. He has a rare condition called Diamond-Blackfan anaemia. It means he can't make his own red blood cells and needs blood transfusions every four weeks to keep him alive. His mum Zoe said: ""Transfusions are absolutely critical for Henry. We are reliant on blood donors... just to keep him alive."" In the days before each blood transplant, Henry's energy levels ""plummet"" according to his mum. ""When he gets this magical transfusion of blood, he's transformed into a healthy little boy,"" his mum says. ""For Henry - and people like him -  it's being able to celebrate their birthday [next week], it's giving us the opportunity to tuck into bed on Christmas Eve and watch him wake up on Christmas morning. It's the gift of life."" ""If you can donate blood, please, please do."" Mike Stredder, director of blood donation for NHS Blood and Transplant., said: ""Demand for lifesaving blood doesn't stop for Christmas. We need our loyal donors more than ever at this time of year."" Missed appointments rise in the middle of December, as people's diaries fill up with parties and shopping excursions. The cold weather can also put people off going out. In the worst pre-Christmas period last year, one in 10 people couldn't even be bothered to cancel and just failed to turn up for their appointment altogether. And this year, amid fears of a predicted cold spell - from the end of November to the second week of December, the situation could be worse than ever. Should we pay people for donating blood? Scientists 'turn type-A blood into type-O' Blood donation rules eased for gay and bisexual men NHS Blood and Transplant needs to collect 1.4 million units of blood each year to meet the needs of patients across England. And autumn donations were also unexpectedly low this year, further fuelling fears over a Christmas shortage. New donors will take too long to process in the run-up to Christmas, meaning blood banks will be dependent upon those already registered. So the NHS Blood and Transplant are calling on regular donors to make an appointment - and keep it. Donors who need to cancel are being asked to give at least three days' notice so the slot can be given to someone else. ""Please keep your appointment to give blood,"" says Mr Stredder. ""We need... to make sure hospitals have the blood that seriously ill children and adults will need over Christmas and the new year.""",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46258687,"Some 3,000 foreign doctors in the UK are being urgently checked after a woman practised psychiatry for 22 years without any qualifications. New Zealander Zholia Alemi falsely claimed to have a medical degree from Auckland university when she registered in the UK in the 1995. But she had actually dropped out of medical school in her first year. The General Medical Council (GMC) - the doctors' watchdog - has apologised for its ""inadequate"" checks in the 1990s. The GMC - which decides whether a doctor is qualified to practise in the UK - said it was sorry for ""any risk arising to patients as a result"" and that it was confident its current processes are ""far stronger"". Alemi was jailed for fraud in October after she faked a dementia patient's will in an attempt to inherit her ¬£1.3m estate. Now, following an investigation by Cumbria newspaper the News and Star, a review has been triggered.  The licences of potentially thousands of doctors are being looked at. When registering in the UK in 1995, Alemi claimed to have a medical degree from the University of Auckland - which she did not have.  But her false medical qualification was only discovered after she was convicted of fraud and theft in October 2018 after taking advantage of a vulnerable patient. Alemi, who was working as a consultant psychiatrist for a dementia service in west Cumbria at the time, redrafted the patient's will and fraudulently applied for power of attorney.  When asked by police whether Alemi had assisted with her financial affairs, the victim said: ""I think she just helped herself."" The judge described her crimes as ""wicked"". She denied the charges but was found guilty at Carlisle Crown Court and jailed for five years. Alemi lost her job after being arrested in 2016 and was suspended by the medical tribunal service in June 2017. The GMC said Alemi was allowed to join the UK's medical register under a section of the Medical Act which has not been in force since 2003. The act meant medical school graduates from certain Commonwealth countries - like New Zealand - were allowed to join the register on the basis of the qualification they obtained at home. They did not have to sit and pass the standard two-part medical test that foreign doctors normally have to pass before they can work in the UK - the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board exam (PLAB). The GMC said its checks are now more ""rigorous"" and stronger than they were. The council said that now any similar fraudulent attempts to join the medical register would be identified. But the records of up to 3,000 doctors - who registered for a licence under the same rules as Alemi - are now being urgently reviewed. The GMC said it was not expecting to find anything untoward.  Charlie Massey, the GMC's chief executive, called it a ""serious"" issue and said the police and other agencies including NHS England have been informed. ""We are confident that, 23 years on, our systems are robust and would identify any fraudulent attempt to join the medical register."" The GMC said patients place a great deal of trust in doctors, and ""to exploit that trust and the respected name of the profession is abhorrent"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""As the organisation responsible for regulating doctors, we expect the GMC to investigate how this criminal was able to register as a doctor and put measures in place to make sure it can't happen again."" The GMC has created a web page with advice for anyone who is concerned that they were treated by Alemi. It urges anyone who was treated by her to contact the GP surgery, hospital or clinic where they received treatment.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46235052,"Noise levels in hospitals are getting worse, research suggests. Anyone who has ever stayed overnight in a hospital will know how difficult it can be to sleep, surrounded by staff, machinery, trolleys and telephones. In the UK, 40% of hospital patients are bothered by noise at night, according to in-patient surveys. But it's not only the patients' wellbeing that may be affected - high noise levels can also have an impact on staff performance and burnout rates. Researchers from King's College London say noise levels in intensive care - where the most vulnerable patients are looked after - regularly exceed 100 decibels. That's the equivalent of loud music being played through headphones. And it's not just the frustration of being unable to hear each other speak or the fatigue and irritation sparked by poor sleep that are causing concern. At that level, noise pollution has been implicated in the development of a condition known as intensive care psychosis - a form of delirium where patients experience anxiety, become paranoid, hear voices and see things that are not there. London deaths linked to noise pollution Hospital wards 'far too noisy' Increased stress, greater pain sensitivity, high blood pressure, and poor mental health are also possible side-effects. It means patients often decide to leave hospital before they are completely better - only to be re-admitted at a later stage. Coronary care patients treated during noisy periods were found to have a higher incidence of rehospitalisation, compared with those treated during quieter periods. ""People leave early, and long after discharge the trauma remains. It puts patients off coming back,"" Dr Andreas Xyrichis, lead author of the report, told the BBC. For staff, a noisy working environment is unavoidable - but the consequent stress can affect their performance, while the difficulties of hearing each other and patients speak can compromise the quality and safety of healthcare.  Researchers say progress in combating noise pollution in hospitals has been ""unacceptably slow-moving"". So far, they say, attempts to reduce noise have been piecemeal and idiosyncratic. Researchers are calling for a more co-ordinated approach - and solutions that actively involve patients. The team, from King's and the University of the Arts London (UAL), believe three key areas must be addressed: Dr Xyrichis questions whether sound ""is considered"" when creating or redeveloping hospital infrastructure. But he stresses that modifications can be made to existing environments at a relatively low cost. Interventions such as sound-absorbing panels and noise-warning systems ""have provided some benefit"". Elsewhere, small trials have shown that sound-masking - the use of background sound (such as white noise) in particular environments to reduce noise-induced disturbance - can significantly improve sleep. Most importantly, says Dr Xyrichis, research should ""be more aware of the patients"". He says research made clear that much of patients' agitation over noise was often caused by ""not knowing what the noises were"". ""It can be very frightening in hospital. We need to do more work with patients to find out about what kinds of noises stress them out.""",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-46193709,"Margot Noel has a condition called misophonia, which literally means ""hatred of sound"". It can be so disturbing that she has to wear headphones or ear plugs to protect herself. Someone takes a bite out of an apple.  There's a drawn-out crunch as the teeth break through the tough skin of the fruit. The noise is unbearable for 28-year-old Margot Noel. ""I have to leave or cover my ears. I just cannot hear it,"" she says. ""It puts me in a state of distress, it makes me really anxious. My body feels there's danger - I need to leave or I need to protect myself."" Margot has misophonia, which she describes as a brain dysfunction that causes common sounds to produce an intense emotional response - such as anger, panic, fear or distress. In people with this condition, the part of the brain that joins our senses with our emotions - the anterior insular cortex - is overly active and wired up to other parts of the brain in a different way. There are many possible trigger sounds, but some of the most common are related to food - crunching, slurping or sipping. Margot's trigger sounds include the crunching of crisps, whispering, clicking noises made with pens, keyboard tapping and one of the worst - knuckle cracking.  ""My reaction to this one is really physical because it's one of the worst for me,"" she says. ""It makes me jump off my chair and I'll have to do something to make it stop, which is not the case with all of my other triggers.  ""It's not like a sound you don't like, it's much more than that, it's completely different. It's something I feel in my stomach, like extreme anxiety. Or suddenly I feel overwhelmed, I can't think any more, it just takes over everything.  ""If someone had a gun and they were pointing it at me, it would feel exactly the same."" According to the British Tinnitus Association's website, trigger sounds tend to be ""human-generated noises that are under voluntary control"", such as sniffing. But if Margot sniffs herself, that's different. ""I can stop doing it if I want, so it's not as threatening as someone else doing something that you can't control and you don't know how long it's going to last for,"" she says. One of her earliest memories is of her brother tormenting her by clicking his tongue. ""I'm about six or seven and it's a constant fight between us,"" she says. ""My brother knows that tongue-clicking is a problem for me, I've said it a few times, so now he has power over me and he's two years younger than me. If I annoy him, if I don't do something he wants, he will just start tongue-clicking."" Margot's parents didn't understand how the noise was affecting her and so would tell Margot to ""grow up,"" and put up with it. Now they are older, Margot says her brother is much more understanding, but she is reluctant to complain if he makes a sound that is excruciating to her.  ""I was having dinner with my brother yesterday. I gave him a gum after dinner and he was chewing it like a cow, it was horrendous, and I didn't want to ask him to chew less loudly, because people usually get offended,"" she says. ""They feel like it's an attack or a criticism when it's not, it's actually not. I'm the problem, but it's very difficult to ask people to make less noise because they always end up feeling like they can't be themselves around you."" Although she says she's had the condition all her life, she didn't realise it was misophonia until about three years ago.  ""It was becoming clearer that I had a problem and I couldn't find what it was. Sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't have the right keywords on Google.  ""One day I was really angry and I was crying, because I was watching an amazing play and I was just distracted the whole time by someone breathing like they were going to die, and I went back home, looked again, again, again and then I found it, and from that moment, to be honest, it was really great just understanding."" Margot also discovered, via Google, that a study into misophonia was being conducted at Newcastle University and emailed the person in charge, Dr Sukhbinder Kumar, to thank him.  He wrote back, and soon invited Margot to take part. Also known as Selective Sound Sensitivity, misophonia is a strong emotional response to the presence or anticipation of a sound. There are three key emotional responses: anger, disgust and anxiety, with anger being the predominant emotion. These intense emotions are accompanied by high levels of arousal - the fight or flight response. There is a release of adrenaline and a supply of energy to respond to the threat. This is typically experienced as a fast heart beat, rapid shallow breaths, tension, hotness, shakiness, and sweating. Work environments, such as open plan offices, can be a minefield of triggers. Tensions can develop within intimate relationships and couples can find it difficult to share normal activities together, as someone breathing or eating can become infuriating. Source: British Tinnitus Association The trial was terrifying. She had to listen to some of her trigger sounds without reacting to them or even closing her eyes. ""I had wires all over my face, everywhere, and they were studying my reactions to the sounds and I just couldn't do all of it,"" she says.  ""It wasn't that I gave up, because I told them I wanted to do it, but they said I had to stop because I was too distressed and it was confusing the results. ""I think I had to do six modules and I only did two, and after two I was just crying like I'd never cried before."" Margot found the trial so distressing because she could not use any of her usual coping mechanisms to escape the trigger sounds. In day-to-day life she wears ear plugs or headphones to block the noises out. ""I cannot live without music,"" she says. ""My headphones are on my ears all the time, even if there's no music in them - just ready to rescue me if something happens. Music for me feels very much like a protection."" Artists such as Moby, David Bowie, Air, Diana Ross, Oasis and Daft Punk have become the soundtrack to her life, she says. Even watching a film can be difficult. ""I hate, for example, the sound of people kissing. That disgusts me, I find it 'aargh!!'"" she says. ""One film out of two has people kissing passionately. Some films they don't make too much sound, but in others they do and I'll just have to cover my ears and wait for it to be finished."" When it comes to her own relationships, however, misophonia has not caused any problems so far.  ""I try to surround myself with people that are understanding,"" she says. ""For me it would be a major downer if I was with a guy and I told him, 'Can you stop cracking your knuckles?' and he made fun of me. That would be an absolute no no for me. I'd be like, 'Well, goodbye.' ""I think if people like you they just try to like all the little things about you, even the ones they don't really understand. If you really like someone you don't want them to feel uncomfortable, you want to make them happy."" Margot is currently seeing someone and has a good social life, but says living with misophonia can be very isolating. She lives on her own, which she says is a ""dream,"" and works as a freelancer for advertising agencies.  ""I'm quite solitary. I write a lot, alone, in my office, like a tortoise,"" she says. Dr Sukhbinder Kumar says there is no scientifically validated method to cure misophonia, but that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has shown some initial positive results. It's also not clear how many people have the condition, he says, though he points out that one study conducted among undergraduates showed that as many as 20% had significant misophonia symptoms. Margot often doesn't tell people about her own symptoms as she finds they are not always sympathetic - and sometimes even think it's something she has invented. ""I just try to deal with it on my own without asking people to change their behaviour,"" says Margot. She hopes the study she took part in will eventually lead to new treatments. But also looks forward to a day when more people know that the condition exists. ""If I could just ask someone next to me in the theatre, 'I'm sorry, can you just try to not do that noise, I h",,,,

None of nearly 500 four- to 17-year-olds from the US and Europe could tolerate even a 10th of a peanut dose. But after taking tiny daily doses for a year, two-thirds could tolerate at least two whole peanuts.  Emily Pratt, six, told the BBC's Today programme it had made a big difference. ""I couldn't have a birthday cake at parties and now I can,"" she said.  She can now tolerate about seven peanuts, which means she can safely eat foods even if they may contain traces of peanut. Emily's mum, Sophie, from north London, said: ""It's been a constant stress.  ""We were quite shocked how you could find traces of peanuts and nuts in all sorts of food, particularly foods that are childhood foods - cakes, biscuits, ice-creams - and that's what was stressful. ""We had to constantly study food labels to ensure peanuts were completely eliminated from Emily's diet.  ""Her allergy was very severe, so even a small amount of peanut could lead to a very serious reaction.  ""The impact on our family life was huge."" The UK chief investigator for Palisade study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Prof George du Toit, a consultant at Evelina London Children's Hospital, said: ""The results of this ground-breaking study are very promising and suggest that we will be able to protect children who are allergic to peanuts from having a severe reaction after accidental exposure. ""This is extremely good news as the number of children being diagnosed with peanut allergy in the UK has more than doubled over the past two decades.  ""Peanut allergy is extremely difficult to manage for children and their families, as they have to follow a strict peanut-free diet.  ""Families live in fear of accidental exposure as allergic reactions can be very severe and can even lead to death."" During the study, participants were randomly assigned into groups that either received capsules of peanut protein or a dummy powder. The amount given gradually increased to cause tolerance.",,,,

While the ban has led to a ""considerable reduction"" in use of the drugs, street dealers are now the main source of supply. Now officially known as new psychoactive substances (NPS), they mimic the effects of other drugs like cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy. They were sold openly, mainly in specialist shops, before May 2016. Since the Psychoactive Substances Act (PSA) came in, they are no longer being sold in the stores, known as head shops, according to the Home Office review.  They said 31 outlets had closed, with a further 332 no longer stocking the drugs. Prices have gone up too and ""significantly"" fewer people are using them.  But the report warns the drugs have become more potent, with new strands of them continuing to be produced. This suggests the ban has not yet brought an end to the ""game of cat and mouse"" between law enforcement agencies and those producing NPS. The review also says the ban might have led to the most vulnerable users switching back to drugs like cannabis and cocaine.   One Manchester drug worker quoted in the report said: ""It was so easy before. But after PSA, in Rochdale young offenders, those in care, they found they had less access to NPS.  ""People just couldn't be bothered to source it and there is a culture of 'whatever they can get their hands on easiest'."" But an NPS user in Exeter quoted in the review said: ""Now the shops aren't selling stuff, people get it from another source, like through a dealer. You can still get hold of them just as easily.""  Ministers had brought forward the NPS legislation after the substances were linked to dozens of deaths. It concluded that most of the aims of the act ""appear to have been achieved, with the open sale of NPS largely eliminated, a significant fall in NPS use in the general population, and a reduction in health-related harms which is likely to have been achieved through reduced usage"". But it said areas of concern had remained - or emerged - since the ban, and noted ""continued high levels of synthetic cannabinoid use among the homeless and prison populations.""  The main NPS used within prison is Spice, according to the report.  Under the act, offenders can face up to seven years in prison, with civil orders being issued to close down online dealers and head shops.  Police recorded 492 arrests in the first six months after the act took effect. There were 1,523 seizures of NPS in 2017/18.",,,,

The gunman was seen arguing with the doctor, Tamara O'Neal, who he had been in a relationship with, before shooting her and turning his gun on others. The shooter, named as Juan Lopez, 32, also died but it is not clear if he was killed by police or took his own life. Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the attack ""tears at the soul of our city"". ""It is the face and a consequence of evil,"" he said, adding that the three victims were ""all going about their day, all doing what they loved"". The shootings began with a row in the Mercy Hospital car park between the gunman and Dr O'Neal at about 15:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Monday.  When a friend of the doctor's tried to intervene ""the offender lifted up his shirt and displayed a handgun"", Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. As the friend ran for help, gunfire broke out, witnesses said. One witness, James Gray, told reporters he saw Dr O'Neal fall to the ground and then the gunman ""stood over her and shot her three more times"". When police arrived, the gunman then moved into the hospital, shooting at random and killing pharmacist Dayna Less who was getting off an escalator at the time. In an exchange of fire with the gunman, police officer Samuel Jimenez was killed. A second police officer avoided injury after a bullet fired in his direction became lodged in his gun in his holster. Hospital patients scrambled to find cover under desks, police and Swat teams moved through the hospital in search of the gunman, and officers locked down hospital wings, including the nursery. Hector Avitia, who was in the hospital waiting room with his wife, told the Chicago Tribune that he tried to get people away from windows as the bullets started flying. ""I've heard shootings,"" he said. ""I've known people that have died in the neighbourhood like that. But something like that? No."" ""He was just shooting like a maniac,"" he continued. ""And he obviously knows how to shoot because he was holding the gun with both hands."" Dr O'Neal was an emergency physician at Mercy Hospital on Chicago's South Side. Dr Patrick Connor, director of the hospital's emergency department, said she had been ""dedicated to caring for her community - a wonderful individual"". The gunman and Dr O'Neal had been engaged, and were had been planning to marry on 27 October - but that date passed without a wedding, according to CBS Chicago. Dr Connor said Dr O'Neal had graduated from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago in 2016, and had been raising money for disadvantaged children while also leading her church choir. After completing her first degree from Purdue University, she worked two jobs before beginning medical school, according to her hospital bio. Dr Connor also paid tribute to 25-year-old Dayna Less, saying she had joined the hospital in July as a first-year pharmacy resident and was a recent graduate of Purdue University. Police officer Samuel Jimenez was a 28-year-old married father of three young children. ""We cannot thank him enough for his courage and bravery today,"" Dr Connor said.

A BBC Radio 5 Live online survey questioned 2,066 UK adults about their attitudes to sex and relationships. Stress was rated as a problem in the bedroom by more people than any other factor (45%). Relate therapist Ellen Brady said: ""We're seeing an awful lot of clients with anxiety issues - anxiety and sex just doesn't sit together at all."" Other factors highlighted by respondents as having a negative impact on sex included physical health problems, mental health issues, and having children.  Only 10% of respondents highlighted social media as a problem. However, Ms Brady said it probably had a bigger impact than most realised. ""There's not the basic connection happening in couples, they're not even making eye contact or talking to each other, so it's no wonder when they get to bed that sex is difficult."" Overall, half of those questioned said they were satisfied with their sex lives (50% of men and 53% of women). However, 38% of men and a quarter of women said they were not satisfied with their sex lives. The survey suggested 58% of people are generally confident about their sexual performance. The survey suggested men and women take a different view on cheating. Three-quarters of women said they considered a partner paying for an online experience (such as cyber sex) and kissing someone other than their partner to be cheating. But only half of men said the same.  Nine in 10 UK adults (91%) said that having sex with someone other than their partner was cheating, but only two in five (40%) said browsing on a dating app was being unfaithful. So how can you improve your sex life?  Ms Brady from Relate suggests putting a temporary ban on sex, and starting again: ""Ban sex, because whatever you've been doing sexually it's gone wrong, so you want to wipe it out and start again, and just reconnect emotionally and in terms of intimacy.""  ""There's a big gender divide on that one, because women very often want to buy into emotional intimacy and kisses and cuddles and quite often men don't see that as a priority, they see sex as the priority.  ""However in my experience it doesn't take very long for men to actually realise that that's what they want too... and of course it leads them on to sex anyway because that creates the right conditions for sex to happen.""

The UN warned last month that up to 14m Yemenis are on the brink of famine. It is trying to revive talks to end a three-year war which has caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Yemen has been devastated by the conflict. Fighting escalated in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition launched an air campaign against the Houthi rebel movement which had forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. At least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the war, according to the UN. The fighting and a partial blockade by the coalition have also left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that has affected 1.2 million people. It is difficult to get an exact number of deaths. Aid workers in Yemen say many go unreported because only half of the country's health facilities are functioning and many people are too poor to access the ones that remain open. Save the Children says it based its figures on mortality rates for untreated cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition in children under five from data compiled by the UN. According to conservative estimates, it calculated that around 84,700 children may have died between April 2015 and October 2018. Rising food prices and the falling value of the country's currency as a result of a civil war are putting more families at risk of food insecurity. The UK-based charity blames the blockade for putting more people at risk of famine, with continued heavy fighting around the principal lifeline port of Hudaydah further exacerbating the situation. The rebel-held port, through which the country has traditionally imported 90% of its food, has seen commercial imports fall by more than 55,000 metric tonnes a month, the charity says. This is enough to meet the needs of 4.4m people, including 2.2m children, it adds.  Save the Children said it had been forced to bring supplies for the north of Yemen through its southern port of Aden, which has significantly slowed down aid deliveries. Nusair, a 13-month-old boy, is among the children suffering from severe acute malnutrition who is being closely monitored by Save the Children.  He was treated in August but by October his health had deteriorated again. By that time he and his mother had been forced to relocate to a remote area due to increased fighting near their home and were unable to make the long trip to hospital.  ""I can't go to sleep, it is torturing, and I am worried about my children. I couldn't live if any harm came to them,"" his mother, Suad, told the charity.  The charity says that based on historical studies, if acute malnutrition is left untreated, around 20-30% of children will die each year. ""For every child killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's entirely preventable,"" its Yemen director, Tamer Kirolos, says. ""Children who die in this way suffer immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop. Their immune systems are so weak they are more prone to infections with some too frail to even cry.  ""Parents are having to witness their children wasting away, unable to do anything about it."" He further warned that an estimated 150,000 children's lives were endangered in Hudaydah with ""a dramatic increase"" in air strikes over the city in recent weeks. Not yet - but it's getting close.  Just last month, the UN warned that half the population of the war-torn country was facing ""pre-famine conditions"".  A country has to meet the following criteria to be declared in famine: The UN said - based on assessments from a year ago - the first two thresholds had either been exceeded or was dangerously close in 107 of Yemen's 333 districts. But the third threshold about numbers of deaths was more difficult to confirm. The organisation is currently repeating the assessments. UN envoy Martin Griffiths arrived in the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Wednesday for talks with the Houthi rebels in a bid to lay the groundwork for peace talks in Sweden. It comes after a lull in violence was broken on Tuesday, with intense fighting erupting between the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels in Hudaydah. On Monday, the UK presented a draft resolution to the UN urging an immediate truce in the port city and giving both sides of the conflict a two-week deadline to remove all barriers to humanitarian aid. Separately, Saudi Arabia and its ally, the UAE, have pledged $500m (¬£390m; ‚Ç¨440m) in food aid, and say it is intended to reach 10 to 12 million Yemenis.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46275178,"A fish that can repair its heart may hold clues for future treatments in people, according to a study. Scientists studying the Mexican tetra fish found three areas of the fish genome were involved in its ability to regenerate heart tissue.  One gene appeared to play a particularly key role in the process.  Researchers hope their study will one day make it possible to heal heart muscle in patients who have had a heart attack. Hundreds of thousands of people in the UK live with heart failure, often as a result of a heart attack.  Because it is not possible for humans to regenerate their damaged, scarred heart muscle, people either have to live with the condition or may require a heart transplant. For this study, funded by the British Heart Foundation, Dr Mathilda Mommersteeg and her team at the University of Oxford studied two types of Mexican tetra fish - river-dwellers that are able to self-heal their heart tissue, and cave-dwellers that cannot. The cave fish, who once lived in the rivers of Northern Mexico, were washed into caves by floodwaters about 1.5 million years ago and evolved, losing their sight and colour because of living in perpetual darkness.  Comparing the two types of tetra fish, researchers found two genes - lrrc10 and caveolin - were much more active in the river fish following heart injury. Having discovered this, they switched off the lrrc10 gene in a different species of fish with self-healing abilities, the zebrafish.  With this gene no longer working properly, the zebrafish became unable to fully repair its heart without scarring. Scar tissue stops the heart muscle from contracting properly and reduces the heart's ability to pump blood around the body.  Both of these genes are present in humans, and lrrc10 is known to be linked to a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy.  The study authors say their findings suggest it will one day be possible to regenerate damaged hearts in people by artificially modifying how these and other genes function. This could be done either with drugs or through gene-editing techniques, where DNA is modified, deleted or replaced, using tools like Crispr-Cas9. Dr Mommersteeg, who's associate professor of developmental and regenerative medicine, said: ""I do believe that this fish can tell us, at some point, how we can really repair the human heart... ""It's early days but we're incredibly excited about these remarkable fish and the potential to change the lives of people with damaged hearts."" But she said more work is needed to find other key genes that may be involved in the heart regenerating. Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Survival rates for heart failure have barely changed over the last 20 years, and life expectancy is worse than for many cancers.  ""Breakthroughs are desperately needed to ease the devastation caused by this dreadful condition."" The study has been published in Cell Reports.  Follow Alex on Twitter.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-46295439,"A study suggests that one in six veterans who left the British military after serving in a combat role in Iraq or Afghanistan would probably qualify for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In some, the symptoms only appear years later. On Remembrance Day in 2015, Phillip Riding, had been out of the military for one month. He went to the Cenotaph as a civilian, with his medals from Afghanistan pinned to a white shirt, and sang God Save the Queen with the crowd. In the silence afterwards, a bugle sounded The Last Post. And in that moment, suddenly the memories of Afghanistan came flooding back. ""Something inside had snapped. I couldn't breathe, I was panicking standing there in the ceremony with tears rolling down my face,"" Riding says. ""That sound of the bugle reminded me of the moment it was announced every time a comrade was lost."" Friends, killed or injured, flashed in front of his eyes: Bing from artillery, Tres shot in the ankle, Rocco, Plant, Coops, LJ shot in the shoulder, Jordan‚Ä¶. For five years he had been suppressing these thoughts. ""I thought I was fine but all of a sudden I wasn't any more. That door I kept shut, opened completely. This is how PTSD is, it's something that creeps up on you. It just totally destroyed me."" Riding joined the Army in August 2007 at the age of 16, partly to get out of his home town, Barrow-in-Furness, in Cumbria. He'd faced homophobic bullying at school and thought a ""macho"" role in the infantry would help mask the fact that he was gay. ""I was living with these guys seven days a week, and I started copying how straight men moved. My body language was super-exaggerated to be manly because I was trying to fit to this image of who I wanted to be in my head."" He would plaster his bedside with soft porn. ""Bikini models were for sure not what I wanted to see first thing in the morning but there we are.""   He even put a pretend girlfriend in his will before leaving for his tour of Afghanistan. In 2010 the British military had the task of curbing opium production in Helmand Province. It was a dangerous job in territory largely controlled by the Taliban. ""Once you've been shot at it never leaves your brain. The bullet that comes near you sounds like a crack of a whip. There were countless operations where I was in a near-death situation, almost blown up in armoured vehicles by improvised devices or ducking shells from our Apache [helicopter]."" Riding wasn't hurt himself, but many were.  ""There was a task to go out and do some metal-detecting. We played a game of rock paper scissors to decide who should go on patrol and who should stay behind. I won the game. He went out and was shot in the ankle."" One of his roles in Afghanistan was to drive lorries. Once he went on rest and recreation, and the driver who took his place rolled over an IED and ended up having his back reconstructed. He was lucky, but being lucky made him feel guilty. ""Shouldn't it have been me? Shouldn't I have gone on patrol?"" he asks. Coming close to death made Riding think hard about his life, and he decided to come out and live authentically as a gay man. ""It was like being born again,"" he says. ""This time I was being who I wanted to be - myself."" Initially his family didn't take the news well. Around Christmas 2011, when Same-Sex Marriage Bill was passing through Parliament, Riding's younger brother asked if he would get married. His grandmother then said she wouldn't attend the wedding if so, and his mother followed suit. ""There was an argument, and I wish that I had handled it better,"" he says. He left home on Boxing Day. Coming out to people in the army didn't go well either. Some former friends got up and left when he sat down next to them at dinner. Things only improved after he launched a complaint. Now he decorated his bedside exuberantly with rainbow flags and male pin-ups. He also found solace in London's LGBT community, travelling up there at the weekends. The gay nightclub scene in Soho was so different from army life, it was a form of escape. ""It was blessing to talk to people who didn't know anything about the military or what it was like in Afghanistan. ""My friends were incredulous, teasing me: 'Seven months in Afghanistan? Just you and all those soldiers, and nothing happened? Yeah right!'"" Being in the army isn't like it's depicted in the movies. ""Not everyone is really handsome, dashing. You're enjoying not thinking about romance. From the moment you wake up, you're working and your mind is on the job."" But the high-octane pace of clubbing also seemed to serve one of his needs after the tour in Afghanistan. ""When you have adrenaline pumped into you every single day for seven months, when you come home that's missing. Time moves slow. People moved slowly. It was so quiet. I needed to be in the clubs to fill that gap. ""Being in a nightclub, it's just so loud, the bass in the floor. There is so much energy everywhere - it's sensory overload."" Riding had his driving licence revoked after being caught speeding twice in two years after he returned from Helmand. ""Once I was going 85 mph on a 60 mph dual carriageway with music at full blast. Risky stuff like that because it was an adrenaline rush."" He thinks that the excitement of coming out probably helped to mask his PTSD after Afghanistan. ""I didn't think I had an issue. I was dealing with accepting my sexuality and meeting all these new people. For the first time in my life, there were people who I fancied who actually fancied me back!"" When it came to renew his contract with the army in October 2015, he decided against it and took up a job as an events manager for a nightclub. He would go into Soho in the day, arrange the events and be ready to work late into the night, while socialising with friends. But he found himself asking this question: ""I've come out, but why am I still hitting the bottle? Why am I still not wanting to go to sleep?"" And a month later, on Remembrance Day, he received an answer. Riding likens the feeling of suppressing his PTSD to trying to hold down an inflatable ball in water. ""It's different for everybody, but this is what it's like for me. I kept trying to hold down all the things I saw and you can only hold it down for so long. The more you hold it down, the stronger the ball shoots back up, more powerful than before. And that's what happened with me."" He started having nightmares about his time on tour and working all night seemed to help him cope. ""I would have flashbacks. I did what I could to avoid closing my eyes in case I started to see Afghanistan,"" he says. ""I wanted to physically exhaust myself, so that when I eventually got home in the early hours, I could just collapse in bed and I wouldn't dream."" The Last Post had been the first sound to trigger Riding's PTSD, but other everyday sounds now had the same effect - a motorcycle abruptly appearing from nowhere or someone yelling in the street. Flashbacks & nightmares: These can be so realistic that it feels as though you are living through the traumatic experience again and again - ordinary sounds, sights and smells can trigger flashbacks  Avoidance & numbing: You distract yourself by keeping your mind busy with an activity or working very hard, while avoiding places and people that remind you of the trauma - and you may try to become emotionally numb, feeling nothing at all Being hypervigilant:  You stay alert all the time, as though you are looking out for danger - anxiety makes it hard to sleep, and others may notice that you are irritable and cannot relax Source: The Royal College of Psychiatrists There was a trigger in the club as well. ""At midnight they have this balloon drop, balloons fall from the ceiling and they bounce on the crowd. The sound it makes is just like gunfire happening over my head."" The first time he experienced it he was frozen on the spot. ""It shocked me that even though my brain was telling me I am literally just seeing balloons fall down, I couldn't move because I was panicking."" It got to the point that Riding would leave quickly when the balloon drop was about to happen and his friends noticed. ""No-one understood why, because I didn't tel",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46291919,"A nutritional supplement may be able to slow the development of some cancers and enhance the effects of treatment, a study in mice suggests. Mice with pancreatic, lung or skin cancer were given mannose, a sugar also found in cranberries and other fruits. It significantly slowed the growth of their tumours, with no obvious side-effects, researchers found. However, patients are being told not to start supplementing with mannose because of the risk of side-effects. Scientists hope to test the supplement in people soon.  Mannose, which can be bought in health food shops and is sometimes used to treat urinary tract infections, is thought to interfere with the ability of tumours to use glucose to grow. Scientists also looked at how mannose might affect cancer treatment by giving it to mice that had been treated with two of the most widely used chemotherapy drugs, cisplatin and doxorubicin. They found it enhanced the effects of chemotherapy, slowing the growth of tumours and reducing their size. It also increased the lifespan of some mice. In further tests, cells from other types of cancer, including leukaemia, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), ovarian and bowel cancer were exposed to mannose in the laboratory. Some cells responded well, while others did not.  How well the cells responded appeared to depend on the levels they had of an enzyme that breaks down mannose.  Lead author Prof Kevin Ryan, from the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, said his team had found a dosage of mannose that ""could block enough glucose to slow tumour growth in mice but not so much that normal tissues were affected"".  Bodies require glucose for energy but cancerous tumours also use it to fuel their growth. ""This is early research but it is hoped that finding this perfect balance means that, in the future, mannose could be given to cancer patients to enhance chemotherapy without damaging their overall health,"" he said. One advantage of mannose is that it is cheaper than drugs produced by pharmaceutical companies. And Prof Ryan said he hoped tests in people could begin soon. However, he and other experts warn that the findings do not mean people with cancer should start supplementing with mannose.  Martin Ledwick, Cancer Research UK's head nurse, said: ""Although these results are very promising for the future of some cancer treatments, this is very early research and has not yet been tested in humans.  ""Patients should not self-prescribe mannose, as there is a real risk of negative side-effects that haven't been tested for yet. ""It's important to consult with a doctor before drastically changing your diet or taking new supplements."" Prof Ryan said his team would next seek to investigate why mannose worked in some cancer cells and not others, so they could work out which patients might benefit the most.  The research is published in the journal Nature.  Follow Alex on Twitter.",,,,

She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire that while she respected his decision, his death felt like abandonment.  ""There was a sense of people saying, 'Hasn't he done a wonderful thing?' But I had two children who were in bits,"" Deborah says. When Simon travelled to the Eternal Spirit clinic in Switzerland to die, in October 2015, he was accompanied by his wife and a film crew. The resulting BBC documentary, How to Die: Simon's Choice, was the only good thing to come out of it, Deborah says.  ""He had an altruistic streak so he felt that letting them follow him would benefit lots of people.  ""I was inundated with letters and I still am - from people saying it was so helpful and made them feel less alone."" But the aftermath was more complicated for her and she does not think the law on assisted dying should be changed. ""Simon's death wasn't bad - but when you open the gate, what happens next?"" she says. ""Older lonely people, or people sitting on lots of money, people already feel a burden - it's something, how we value human life, that really worries me."" Deborah describes businessman Simon as ""a whirlwind of a person - funny and loyal"". ""I didn't want him to leave me,"" she says. ""He was such a rock. He was always on my side"".  Her daughter Chloe had died aged 18, three years before Simon. She had Ewing's sarcoma - a type of bone cancer. ""He was diagnosed as he had a funny feeling in his tongue. We lost Chloe a year before so I couldn't believe this was happening. I thought, 'Please God, let it be a stroke'. Even though I lost Chloe, I couldn't imagine my family would get something else.""  Motor neurone disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a progressive and terminal disease that damages the function of nerves and muscles, resulting in severe damage to the brain and spinal cord. It affects up to 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time. Within a couple of months, Simon could hardly talk. ""He was such a fantastic communicator so that was a big deal - a terrible shock,"" Deborah says. Simon tried to take his own life twice before Deborah agreed to go to Switzerland with him. ""Actions speak much louder than words,"" she says.  ""It was almost backing me into a corner and making me feel there was something worse. He was showing 'how desperate I am'.  ""When I look back on that time - it was one horror after another - I had underestimated how important it was that I went with him."" Pro-assisted suicide campaign group Dignity in Dying estimates that every eight days someone from the UK travels to Switzerland for help to die. It is an offence under the Suicide Act 1961 to encourage or assist the suicide or attempted suicide of another person in England and Wales - and can lead to 14 years in prison. Assisted suicide is also unlawful in Scotland and Northern Ireland. ""I didn't worry about breaking the law personally for me, although we didn't want the girls to come for that reason,"" Deborah says. ""I knew we were all working from the best intentions. I do think there should be a law and I respect this law."" Deborah explains she experienced grief differently when she lost Simon and Chloe. ""Losing a child is different to everything. The pain is fundamental to who you are and you don't want it to go. Sometimes when I am happy, I feel guilty. The pain reminds you of them, which you like,"" she says.  Chloe's death had been gentle, which Deborah says was the key to her being able to live on.  ""How Simon died - it was so different - there was the worry if we were doing the right thing. With Chloe, there was no choice,"" she says.  She is now campaigning with oncologists and drug specialists for better access for children and teenagers to drugs, and cutting the age of entry to drug trials from 18 to 12.    ""It's a culture that stems from thalidomide,"" she says. ""Its intention is trying to put safety into drug development [- but] we need to protect children from lack of research."" Deborah has also written a book about her experiences. ""One thing that is very close to my heart is the importance of resilience and making choices to live afterwards,"" she says. ""I hope people think, 'Heavens if she can do it, so can I.'  I guess this is the main reason I wrote my book and why I read others at my darkest times.

1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46295719,"Nearly one in four young women has a mental illness, with emotional problems such as depression and anxiety the most common, figures for England show. The official NHS report found young women aged 17 to 19 were twice as likely as young men to have problems, with 23.9% reporting a disorder. Problems are less common in younger age groups, but are rising, albeit slowly. In children aged five to 15, one in nine had a disorder, up from one in 10 when the review was done 13 years ago. The findings are based on a survey of more than 9,000 young people. The results have been gathered by statistics body NHS Digital and assessed by experts to try to ensure only diagnosable conditions are included.  Dr Bernadka Dubicka, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the numbers of young women with problems was ""alarming"". She said body image pressures, exam stress and the negative effects of social media may all affect girls disproportionately, while they were also more likely to be victims of abuse and sexual assault. ""We can only speculate. We still do not fully understand this - all we know is that we see more girls in our clinics.  ""We have to make sure services are available for them.""  It comes as the Children's Commissioner for England warned there was a ""vast gap"" in NHS mental health support. Anne Longfield's report criticised slow progress made in improving specialist community services for children. She said waiting times were too long and she was concerned about numbers being rejected by services in some areas. Nearly half of those in their late teens with mental health problems had self-harmed or attempted suicide. For younger teens it was about a quarter. Emma Blezard, 18, says her mental health problems have robbed her of her teenage years. She started experiencing difficulties when she was 13, suffering from anxiety and panic attacks before developing an eating disorder. It was a year before she let on to her parents. She ended up having suicidal thoughts and was sectioned in hospital at one point. ""I've missed so much of my life because of this illness - I've lost friends, I've missed birthday, holidays.  ""I wish I could do things over."" Even when she was receiving treatment, she felt she did not deserve it.  ""I became really isolated. At school I spent a lot of time out of lessons with the nurse. It was very difficult."" She has travelled all over the country for treatment and says she still struggles, although her problems are more manageable now.  ""I don't think they will ever go away."" It may be a factor, although it is hard to tell.  The NHS Digital review found children aged 11 to 19 with a mental health problem were more likely to use social media.  Nearly a third of them spent over four hours a day on social media.  Those who did not have a mental health problem were two to three times less likely to spend that amount of time on it. The young people with mental health problems were more likely to say their mood was affected by the number of ""likes"" they got and they were also more likely to compare themselves to others on social media. The report cited cyber-bullying as an issue too. But while this does suggest social media can have a negative impact, it does not prove it is to blame. People with mental health problems may be just more likely to find themselves on it, rather than it causing their problems in the first place. Indeed, they could even be using social media for support. The majority of problems reported, particularly in the older age groups, are linked to emotional disorders. These are on the rise, whereas the other disorders they looked at - behavioural and hyperactivity - have remained relatively stable over time. University College London psychiatrist Dr Michael Bloomfield said: ""Adolescence is a critical period for a person's development, particularly as our brains go through important changes during our teenage years.   ""Since prevention is better than cure, it is really important for all of us in society to understand together why this is and start reducing the rates of mental disorders in young people."" The NHS is only treating a fraction of the young people who have problems. The Children's Commissioner's analysis of NHS figures from 2017-18 show that 325,000 children were treated by community services, while there are another 5,000 in hospital.  That is fewer than 3% of the population. The figures showed that more than a third of young people referred to community services were turned away. This could be because their needs were not severe enough to need help and could be dealt with through other services, such as in school or by charities and council social care teams. But Ms Longfield said she was concerned children were getting turned away because services simply did not have time to see them. Her report also raised concerns about waiting times. Just under half of people who received treatment after a referral in 2017-18 had waited longer than six weeks. The average waiting time was nearly two months. The commissioner believes children's services are under-funded. Around ¬£700m is spent on child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and eating disorders support.  By comparison, services for adults receive 15 times more despite children representing 20% of the population. The commissioner said an extra ¬£1.7bn would need to be invested to bring children's services in line. She said this could help pay for more early help by funding NHS counsellors in schools for example. Emma Thomas, chief executive of the Young Minds charity, said there was a lack of support for children. She said the charity gets ""calls every day"" about children who are waiting for help or have been denied help. ""This can have devastating consequences - in some cases, children start to self-harm, become suicidal or drop out of school while waiting for the help they need."" She agreed early intervention and better funding were essential. Both NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care have made improving children's mental health care a priority. In fact, the commissioner's report noted that investment was increasing and there had been good progress in terms of tackling eating disorders with new services and strict targets for access. Last month, in his Budget, the chancellor announced at least ¬£2bn of the extra ¬£20bn earmarked for the NHS by 2023 would go on mental health. A new four-week target for access to CAMHS is also going to be piloted soon and NHS England has promised another 70,000 children will be able to access support in the coming years. National mental health director Claire Murdoch said the scale of the problem identified by NHS Digital showed the importance of ""ramping up"" access to services. She said the NHS long-term plan, due out soon, would set out more details about future investment. ""Everyone who works with children and young people, whether in the public, private or voluntary sector, has to play their part if we are to protect young people's mental wellbeing."" Ministers have also being putting pressure on social media firms to do more about cyber-bullying and aggressive behaviour online. One option being considered is a new regulator for the internet.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46220556,"Friends Judith and Anne turned insecurity after surgery into an environmentally friendly business called Giggle Knickers. When Judith Balcazar went in for an operation to remove a lump from her bladder, she never thought she would come out of the operating theatre with a business idea. Judith, 65, a former fashion director and Anne Davidson, 53, a retired primary school teacher, had always thought they'd go into business together at some stage in their 25-year friendship - but never thought it would involve a pair of knickers. The surgery on Judith's bladder had left her muscles weak and often she felt unable to laugh or cough without the anxiety of wetting herself.  But she is far from alone - experts believe one in three women suffer from urinary incontinence.  The NHS has warned that millions who experience incontinence are suffering in silence because they are too embarrassed to talk about the issue.  Judith recalls when she first looked for incontinence products. ""It was actually quite embarrassing going into the chemist and even having to think about walking down this aisle and having to ask where they were and that kind of thing because I wasn't sure what I was looking for,"" she says. But it was during this shopping experience that she recalled a staggering article she had read about the environmental impact of pads and nappies. Environmental groups have warned about the impact of the billions of these products that enter the global landfill system every year. Nappies usually have synthetic polymer fillings that can take 500 years to decompose. Adult incontinence products, at several times the size of babies' nappies, take up more room and demand is rising.  ""I know that we've got an ageing population throughout the Western world,"" Judith says.  She looked for alternatives, but only found Bridget Jones-like incontinence knickers and other large plastic pants. ""You would die of embarrassment if anybody actually ever saw you in them,"" she says.  ""I just wanted to do something that looked like a normal pair of knickers so that if you're in the gym and you're taking your gear off‚Ä¶ you're not terrified of anybody else seeing them. ""It was just wanting to have something that just felt normal and looked normal and didn't contribute to landfill."" Anne loved Judith's initial idea after the pair spoke about it over a cup of tea. The pair believed they had found a gap in the market and went straight to work, and soon Giggle Knickers was born. They wanted the product to be designed specifically for light incontinence, as Judith had experienced, absorbing liquid without having to use any disposable pad inserts.  Funding was the first thing on the list, and initially they tried to use online crowdfunding before going on the BBC's Dragons' Den programme. The investors all seemed to like the idea, but not enough to back them financially. Eventually the pair found financing in the form of a government start-up loan of ¬£25,000. They knew the crucial part of the product was its functionality. Judith looked into cutting-edge, high-absorbency fabrics herself, researching new developments in micro-fibres and even gaining inspiration from other industries such as car manufacturing.  ""I stuttered home with lots of pieces of paper and an eyedropper and I dropped water on things,"" she says. ""I tested how much they went through and then I put things on blotting paper to see how much was going through there, and then how long they took to dry in the air."" They pinned the samples to pants, testing how they worked and how they performed when washed several times.  The duo had aimed to produce the knickers in the UK but costs drove them to China to make the products accessible for everyday consumers. Judith believes one of the reasons the incontinence market has been relatively untapped so far is because the subject remains somewhat stigmatised. ""To actually be found with pads in your handbag I think for most women would be just excruciatingly embarrassing,"" she says. Anne says companies like Giggle Knickers have been accused by some of ""preying on women's insecurities"" to make them buy products, instead of going to seek help or trying pelvic floor exercises, but she disagrees. ""We're not trying to say, 'Oh, put up with this and buy our product.'  ""We're saying, 'No, you absolutely should go and see your GP.  ""But in the meantime, you may need something that is a little less embarrassing, a little more environmentally friendly than buying pads."" In recent years a number of celebrities, including actress Kate Winslet and television presenter Nadia Sawalha, have come out and spoken about their incontinence - something Anne hopes will help break the taboo.  ""There are lots of people out there, you know, physiotherapists and lots of groups now on Twitter and Instagram, where they're trying to get people to talk about it,"" she says. ""It happens to men as well, it isn't just women and rather than being ashamed and embarrassed about it, we should talk about it."" BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year and shares their stories. It's been a momentous year for women's rights around the globe, so in 2018 BBC 100 Women will reflect the trailblazing women who are using passion, indignation and anger to spark real change in the world around them.",,,,

The devices include heart pacemakers, rods to correct spines, and artificial knees and hips. The investigation found implants that had failed in baboons, or were tested only on pigs and dead bodies, were coming onto the market.  The industry says it has transformed millions of lives for the better. BBC Panorama has been working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and 58 media organisations around the world including The Guardian newspaper and the British Medical Journal. The investigation found a lax system of regulation in Europe that allows companies to ""shop around"" dozens of safety organisations until one of them approves their product. It also found that doctors can be left in the dark about the true risk of treatments they are recommending to their patients. Maureen McCleave, 82 from Essex, was the first person in the UK to be fitted with the ""Nanostim"" pacemaker because of an irregular heartbeat. Pacemakers are life-saving implants that deliver electrical pulses to the heart to keep them beating regularly.  Traditional ones have leads from a battery to the heart that deliver the electrical pulse, but the cables can break. The Nanostim was the first leadless pacemaker that sat inside the heart. Maureen said she was ""over the moon"" to be the first and felt like a ""good guinea pig"" when she was implanted with the device at Bart's hospital in London.  ""I was so grateful that I'd been chosen, because it sounded too good to be true."" But three years after it was fitted, the battery in Maureen's Nanostim failed and surgeons could not get it out.  She now has a traditional pacemaker keeping her alive. The Nanostim is still sitting inside her heart. She says: ""I don't like the thought I've got a piece of metal or whatever in my heart that's doing nothing and it's just laying there."" Maureen was not alone - a number of batteries failed and parts fell off inside patients.  The pacemaker was withdrawn for safety reasons. At least two people died and ninety events were recorded in which patients were seriously harmed by the device. The Nanostim heart pacemaker was turned down by safety bodies in Germany because of a lack of evidence. Yet it was approved by the British Standards Institute in the UK. Not all medical devices are dangerous. Many save lives or dramatically improve quality of life.  But the investigation has found that some devices are failing patients including: The BBC also uncovered a treatment for children with a severely curved spine, or scoliosis, which was allowed on to the market following tests only on pigs and dead bodies.  Yet, due to a lack of transparency and data collection, the scale of any problem across the medical device industry remains a mystery to both patients and doctors.  If you are worried, a panel of experts put together by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has put together some advice.  It recommends: ""Your first point of call should be the medical team that performed the operation.  ""If you cannot go back to them for whatever reason, you should consult your primary care doctor.  ""The doctor should be able to refer you to a specialist who is familiar with the device and the surgery you had."" Patients in the UK can also report problems to the regulator. Europe does not have a governmental body that checks medical devices before they are put onto the market.  Instead a series of companies called notified bodies issue CE marks - the same mark of approval given to devices like toasters and kettles.  There are 58 of them in Europe and approval by one means a product can be used anywhere in the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway). But if one body says no, a company can shop around and ask another.  Less than patients might think. And there is so much secrecy that even surgeons implanting these devices do not always see the evidence upon which a device has been approved for its safety and effectiveness.  The British Standards Institution said it could not discuss the evidence for Nanostim due to ""confidentiality requirements"".  Even the UK's regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, says it is ""bound by confidentiality when it comes to some of the actions that we've taken around individual devices"". But the investigation discovered there was only one clinical study before Nanostim was approved for use on the public.  It followed just 33 patients for 90 days. Prof Rita Redberg, one of the world's leading cardiologists and from the University of California, San Francisco, said: ""We're talking about a permanently implanted pacemaker, so I think that's a very tiny study. ""They're supposed to last 10, 20 years. A 90-day follow up is not enough to learn much about the pacemaker."" MedTech Europe, the body the represents the medical devices industry, said: ""Millions of people have safely benefited from medical devices and can now live healthier, more productive and more independent lives.  ""Life is unimaginable today without the hundreds of thousands of medical devices in our hospitals and in our homes."" And it defended the system of notified bodies which were ""selected for the expertise, impartiality, transparency and independence of their staff"".  Abbott, which manufactured Nanostim, says that many patients have been helped by leadless pacemakers and many more will benefit from this technology in the future. It said: ""In accordance with the European CE Mark approval process, the Nanostim leadless pacing system was approved based on strong performance and safety data.  ""In addition, upon CE Mark approval Nanostim was further assessed through a European post market clinical follow-up study."" The UK's Royal College of Surgeons has called for ""drastic regulatory changes"". Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ""All implantable devices should be registered and tracked to monitor efficacy and patient safety in the long-term."" But when the European Union suggested tightening the rules, the industry ran a campaign called ""Don't lose the 3"".  It referred to the fact that manufacturers can get new products to patients three years quicker in Europe then they can in the United States. New medical device regulation will come into force in Europe in 2020, but campaigners say the new rules do not go far enough. German MEP Dagmar Roth Behrendt told Panorama that an intensive lobbying campaign by the industry undermined the proposed reforms. ""It's a success for them and a failure for the European parliament and for European patients, I have no doubt about it.  ""It is like an open wound for me, that we could not do more for European patients and for the safety of European patients hurts.""",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46318446,"A new therapy for children with curved spines was approved for general use after tests only on pigs and dead bodies, an investigation has revealed. Magec rods are supposed to help straighten the spine. But experts say the rods appear to snap too easily and say they are ""very surprised"" at how little evidence was needed to get them approved.  The manufacturers Nuvasive said there was always risk in treating scoliosis and Magec had rebuilt families' lives. BBC Panorama has been working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and 58 media organisations around the world including The Guardian newspaper and the British Medical Journal. Anthony Wainess, from California in the US, had a severely twisted and curved spine from the disease scoliosis. ""All the time I bend down it's like a shark's fin at the back,"" he said back when he was nine and before having treatment. The standard treatment would have involved surgery to insert metal rods around the spine to straighten it. But the rods need to be lengthened as children grow, which means operations every six months. Anthony was given Magec rods in 2013. They are marketed as a safer and cheaper alternative because they can be lengthened with magnets while still in the body. Anthony's dad Steven did not want his son to have to face repeat operations to lengthen the rods in his spine and Magec rods seemed ideal.  But a year after they were fitted, one of the rods snapped inside him.  The rods were replaced, but a year later they snapped again and had to be permanently removed. Steven said: ""It was a very low point for me. And it made me wonder just how good was it to have these Magec rods in to begin with? Did we make a mistake?"" The inventors got them approved for use across Europe via Germany - five years before the US - after studies on pigs and dead bodies.  In the UK, the rods were recommended by NICE, the body that decides best practice for the National Health Service, in 2014 based on ""limited"" evidence from a ""small"" studies in patients.   But before long, surgeons in the north-east of England began to raise concerns. Mike Gibson, a consultant spinal surgeon at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle and a former president of the British Scoliosis Society, has put the rods into 10 children. But he does not think they work properly.  ""When NICE turned around and said that it should be your implant of choice, I was frankly staggered,"" he said. Initially he gave rods he removed to the manufacturer, Nuvasive, to analyse, but heard nothing back.  So he sent rods to engineers at Newcastle University, led by Prof Tom Joyce, who found titanium metal debris had been leaking into children's spines.  Prof Joyce says nobody knows how the titanium might affect the children: ""There's a big question mark there. What are the long term effects of this?"" The Newcastle team has analysed 100 rods. Around 80 of them did not work as they should including problems lengthening.  Mr Gibson also thinks the rods become more vulnerable to breaking as they extend.  He questions why they were ever approved: ""It's very surprising they needed so little data,"" he says.    The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it could not comment on the safety and effectiveness of specific devices because of issues around confidentiality.  Graeme Tunbridge, a senior figure at the regulator, said: ""It's important to remember that before any implant is put into anyone, there's a decision making process and there's a discussion between a clinician and a patient to understand the risks involved in that."" NICE says the decision to recommend Magec was taken after careful consideration of the clinical and economic evidence and that the company has not highlighted any safety issues to them.  The manufacturer Nuvasive says Magec rods have been shown to be effective and that they avoid the pain and complications of the regular operations required by conventional treatment. ""We see every day the challenges brought on by early-onset scoliosis and, while no technology in these patients is without risk, we have also seen Magec rebuild patient and family lives.""",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45715550,"In small villages along the eastern coast of Bangladesh, researchers have noticed an unexpectedly high rate of miscarriage. As they investigated further, scientists reached the conclusion that climate change might be to blame. Journalist Susannah Savage went into these communities to find out more.  ""Girls are better than boys,"" says 30-year-old Al-Munnahar. ""Boys do not listen. They are arrogant. Girls are polite.""  Al-Munnahar, who lives in a small village on the east coast of Bangladesh, has three sons but wished for a girl. Once she thought she would have a daughter, but she miscarried the baby.  She is among several women who have lost a baby in her village.  While miscarriages are not out of the ordinary, scientists who follow the community have noticed an increase, particularly compared to other areas. The reason for this, they believe, is climate change.  The walk to Failla Para, Al-Munnahar's village, is arduous: in the dry season, the narrow track leads into a swamp, and in rainy season, into the sea. The village itself is not much more than a mound of mud with a few shacks and a chicken pen perched precariously on the slippery surface.  ""Nothing grows here anymore,"" says Al-Munnahar. Not many years ago - up until the 1990s - these swamp lands were paddy fields.  If rice production back then was not profitable, it was at least viable. Not anymore. Rising waters and increasing salinity have forced the wealthiest among the villagers to change to shrimp farming or salt harvesting. Today, few paddy fields remain.  ""This is climate change in action,"" says Dr Manzoor Hanifi, a scientist from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (ICDDRB), a research institute. ""The effect on the land is visible, but the effect on the body: that we don't see.""  ICDDRB have been running a health and demographic surveillance site in and around the district of Chakaria, near Cox's Bazaar, for the last thirty years, enabling them to detect even small changes in the health of the communities they monitor.  Over the last few years, many families have left the plains and moved inland, into the forest hill area‚Äîmostly those with enough money to bribe forest wardens.  ""We paid a 230,000 Taka ($2,752, ¬£2,106) bribe to build the house,"" says Kajol Rekha, who moved to the hills from the plains with her husband and two children three years ago. ""Because of the water, my kids would always have a fever, especially when our house remained wet after the flood. Everything is easier here.""  These environmental migrants are faring relatively well, able to grow crops and nearer transport routes to access jobs and schools. They are also in better health than those they left behind.  In particular, women inland are less likely to miscarry. Between 2012 and 2017, the ICDDRB scientists registered 12,867 pregnancies in the area they monitor, which encompasses both the hill area and the plains.  They followed the pregnant women through until the end of the pregnancy and found that women in the coastal plains, living within 20km (12mi) of the coastline and 7m above sea level were 1.3 times more likely to miscarry than women who live inland.  The difference may seem small, but the number of miscarriages on the plains seems to be growing, says Dr Hanifi.  Moreover, when comparing the whole Chakaria region to Matlab, another area monitored by ICDDRB, in a part of Bangladesh far removed from the coast, the scientists also saw a noticeable difference.  In Chakaria, 11% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. In Matlab it is 8%.   This difference, the scientists believe, is to do with the amount of salt in the water the women drink - the increase of which is caused by climate change.  Sea levels are rising, in part because of the melting of icecaps, but also because the earth's rising temperature affects atmospheric pressure: even a small change in this causes an inverse effect on the sea level.  ""With a one millibar decrease in atmosphere pressure,"" says Dr Hanifi, ""the sea level rises by ten millimetres: a series of depressions in atmospheric pressure can cause a considerable rise in water levels in shallow ocean basins."" When sea levels rise, salty sea water flows into fresh water rivers and streams, and eventually into the soil. Most significantly, it also flows into underground water stores - called aquifers - where it mixes with, and contaminates, the fresh water. It is from this underground water that villages source their water, via tube wells.  The water that the village pump in Failla Para spews out is a little red in colour. It is also full of salt. This does not stop villagers drinking from the pump, though - nor from bathing in it and washing and cooking their food in it.  The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people consume no more than 5g of salt per day. In Chakaria, those living in the coastal zone consume up to 16g per day - over three times what those in the hilly areas do.  In countries like the UK, health campaigns have cautioned against excessive salt consumption for years. It causes hypertension, increasing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, and, among pregnant women, miscarriages and preeclampsia.  These Bangladeshi families have no idea of the health risk from the water they are drinking, and even if they did, they have little choice.  ""Salt is bad for crops,"" says 50-year Janatara, who was born in the village and has never left.  When asked if she or her family would leave Failla Para she laughs: ""No, of course not! I've been here my whole life, and anyway, where would we go? We are poor.""  Her neighbour, 23-year old Sharmin would like to leave.  She is uncertain what future there can be for her two sons in Failla Para: ""Life is so hard here,"" she says. Despite this, though, she plans to have another child soon.  At the moment, the chance of miscarriage for women like Sharmin and Al-Munnahar is only slightly elevated. But unless something is done, says Dr Hanifi, ""this will only get worse, as Bangladesh feels the effects of climate change more and more.""  As a low-lying country, full of flood plain land, Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to changes caused by global warming.  But other countries elsewhere, are also likely to experience similar repercussions from rising sea levels.  Across the Indian Ocean, the destruction caused by the 2005 tsunami caused saltwater to contaminate agricultural lands and freshwater drinking sources.  In the American state of Florida, rising sea levels has also led to saltwater encroaching on bodies of fresh water.  Surprisingly, however, the Chakaria health and demographic surveillance site, which monitors the health-related impact of climate change, is one of the only sites of its kind. ""A lot of money is being thrown at climate change interventions,"" says Dr Hanafi, ""but almost none of it goes into research - not for the public health impact anyway. Everyone is thinking about environmental disasters. No one is thinking about public health."" All pictures copyright.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46342195,"Significant doubts have emerged about claims from a Chinese scientist that he has helped make the world's first genetically edited babies.  Prof He Jiankui says the twin girls, born a few weeks ago, had their DNA altered as embryos to prevent them from contracting HIV. His claims, filmed by Associated Press, are unverified and have sparked outrage from other scientists, who have called the idea monstrous.  Such work is banned in most countries.  Gene editing could potentially help avoid heritable diseases by deleting or changing troublesome coding in embryos. But experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes. And many countries, including the UK, have laws that prevent the use of genome editing in embryos for assisted reproduction in humans. Scientists can do gene editing research on discarded IVF embryos, as long as they are destroyed immediately afterwards and not used to make a baby. But Prof He, who was educated at Stanford in the US and works from a lab in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, says he used gene-editing tools to make two twin baby girls, known as ""Lulu"" and ""Nana"". In a video, he claims to have eliminated a gene called CCR5 to make the girls resistant to HIV should they ever come into contact with the virus.  He says his work is about creating children who would not suffer from diseases, rather than making designer babies with bespoke eye colour or a high IQ.  ""I understand my work will be controversial - but I believe families need this technology and I'm willing to take the criticism for them,"" he says in the video. However, several organisations, including a hospital, linked to the claim have denied any involvement. The Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen said it had been unaware of the research project and will now launch an investigation. And other scientists say if the reports are true, Prof He has gone too far, experimenting on healthy embryos without justification.  Prof Robert Winston, Emeritus Professor of Fertility Studies and Professor of Science and Society at Imperial College London, said: ""If this is a false report, it is scientific misconduct and deeply irresponsible. ""If true, it is still scientific misconduct."" Dr Dusko Ilic, an expert in stem cell science at King's College London, said: ""If this can be called ethical, then their perception of ethics is very different to the rest of the world's."" He argues that HIV is highly treatable and that if the infection is kept under control with drugs, then there is almost no risk of the parents passing it on to the baby anyway.  Prof Julian Savulescu, an expert in ethics at the University of Oxford, said: ""If true, this experiment is monstrous. The embryos were healthy - no known diseases.  ""Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer.  ""This experiment exposes healthy normal children to risks of gene editing for no real necessary benefit."" Scientists say baby gene editing may one day be justifiable, but that more checks and measures are needed before allowing it.  Dr Yalda Jamshidi, an expert in human genetics at St George's, University of London, said: ""We know very little about the long term effects, and most people would agree that experimentation on humans for an avoidable condition just to improve our knowledge is morally and ethically unacceptable.  ""Whether the results stand up to scrutiny or not we need as a society to think hard and fast about when and where we are willing to take the risks that come with any new therapeutic treatment, particularly ones that could affect future generations.""",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46329824,"An investigation has raised safety concerns about the most commonly used type of silicone breast implant in the UK. Women in France are now being advised not to use ""textured"" silicone implants while authorities investigate links with a rare form of cancer.  British women are still having the implants put in and there has been no warning from the UK regulator to stop. It says it will take action when it sees there is a problem. A Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) spokesman said: ""We know that there are ongoing concerns about the safety of silicone breast implants - we're keeping a very close eye on that.""  Manufacturers say the safety of the implants is supported by extensive testing and studies, as well as more than a decade of use in America and Europe. The BBC's Panorama programme has been investigating implants with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and organisations around the world, including the Guardian newspaper and the British Medical Journal. Janet Trelawny had breast cancer over 20 years ago. Her breasts were removed and replaced with textured implants. Now, she has been diagnosed with breast implant associated lymphoma (BIA-ALCL).  It is not breast cancer but a type of cancer of the immune system.  In most cases, it is found in the scar tissue and fluid near the implant. But in some, it can spread throughout the body. She said: ""It's frightening to think that something that I'd done because I've had a cancer previously has then caused me to get cancer again.  ""I was absolutely mortified. I'm frightened that this can happen and I had no idea."" Janet is waiting for further biopsy results and has been told she will need to have chemotherapy to treat her cancer.  The French have been investigating breast implants since 2011, when they started receiving reports of BIA-ALCL.  The risks of developing it after an implant vary around the world but are thought to be very small. As of September 2018, the MHRA has received 57 reports of ALCL in patients with breast implants, 45 of which meet specific diagnostic criteria.  That puts the estimated risk of BIA-ALCL at about one per 24,000 implants.  BIA-ALCL appears to have occurred with textured implants made by every manufacturer, according to the British Association of Plastic and Reconstructive Aesthetic Surgeons (BAAPS). Breast implants come with different fillings and different surfaces - smooth and textured.  In the UK, 99% of breast implants used are textured, according to BAAPS. Dr Suzanne Turner, an expert in breast implant associated lymphoma at Cambridge University, said: ""It is a concern, absolutely, particularly now that we're seeing breast implant associated lymphoma developing in these ladies.  ""So, the risk is small but it's a risk that we should know about and be informed of."" The investigation discovered that some manufacturers did not carry out adequate tests before selling textured implants to the public. These tests are called biocompatibility tests and they assess how the body responds to a product.  The manufacturers argued the tests were unnecessary but the French regulator said: ""Almost all of the arguments put forward by the manufacturers were considered to be unacceptable for justifying the lack of biocompatibility tests."" Some manufacturers now say that they have completed the necessary biocompatibility tests.  But the secrecy around the regulatory system does not allow us to see what was done.  The investigation has also found out that manufacturers in Europe and America have under-reported problems with breast implants. Some haven't told regulators when the implants rupture, because they say it's a routine event.  Nobody knows the scale of the risks, because the implants haven't been adequately tracked when they've been put into people and problems may take years to develop.  A register for breast implants was set up in 2016 but at the moment it's still voluntary.  Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence based medicine at Oxford University, says campaigners have been asking for a register for 25 years.  ""Every implant should be in a register because that's what defines patient safety.  In the absence of that, we're in the dark.""",,,,

Prof He also said that the study had been submitted to a scientific journal for review, though he did not name the journal. He also said that ""another potential pregnancy"" of a gene-edited embryo was in its early stages.  But he apologised that his research ""was leaked unexpectedly"", and added: ""The clinical trial was paused due to the current situation."" By Robin Brant, BBC News, Hong Kong  No-one really knew if he was going to show. The auditorium was packed by the time He Jiankui walked on stage. This is the man who says he has given China a world first.  The handful of experts I spoke to, after they'd sat and listened to him, said they believed him. They believe this happened. But the big, big problem was that his speech and answers afterwards were scant on detail. At times he was evasive, failing to give anything like the detail about his work - what he did, how he did it, who knew - that is required of any scientific project wishing to be regarded as credible.  He talked about the stigma attached to HIV/Aids in China and how important the family is to society, but he didn't give the names of ""some experts"" he claimed had reviewed his work and offered feedback. The Crispr gene editing tool he claims to have used is not new to the scientific world, and was first discovered in 2012. It works by using ""molecular scissors"" to alter a very specific strand of DNA - either cutting it out, replacing it or tweaking it. Gene editing could potentially help avoid heritable diseases by deleting or changing troublesome coding in embryos. But experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes. Prof He's recent claims were widely criticised by other scientists.

Anna Simpson described the emergency C-section as the most frightening experience of her life. A study has suggested up to 28,000 women a year in the UK could be affected by maternal post-traumatic stress disorder. NHS England said it was ""improving mental health support for new mums"". Ms Simpson, 34, from Wakefield in West Yorkshire, was rushed to an operating theatre with her unborn daughter Macie in the breech position, after two unsuccessful attempts to move the baby in the womb. ""There were a lot of people around me,"" she said.  ""There was an anaesthetist trying to put a cannula in my hand so I felt like it was being attacked, it felt very frightening, I was very scared."" Experts warn that PTSD - commonly associated with soldiers returning from war - is harder to treat the longer it goes undiagnosed. A traumatic birth can involve unexpected events including the baby's heart rate dropping significantly, an emergency caesarean section and the mother losing several pints of blood after haemorrhaging.  Mothers have a post-natal appointment about six weeks after the baby's birth to assess recovery and check for post-natal depression, but PTSD is not routinely looked for.  Ms Simpson, whose daughter is now 16 months old, said: ""I was going through the birth over and over again, it was exhausting and really painful.  ""It was physically draining, all that on top of having to look after a new baby was really difficult."" Months after the birth, she noticed her emotions were not fading so tried cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) followed by a successful programme of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR works on the theory that traumatic memories have not been properly processed by the brain, but can be reprocessed correctly via therapy involving eye movement, aural and physical prompts. Source: Mind Research from academics at City, University of London, published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, suggested 3-4% of women report PTSD in pregnancy and after birth.  Using this percentage, they calculated 28,000 women could be affected in the UK each year.  Prof Susan Ayers, who co-authored the study, said: ""We need to raise awareness of birth trauma and PTSD both in the general public but also in professionals that come in contact with women.  ""We need to train healthcare professional in terms of identifying [affected] women and we also need to have clear, effective evidence-based treatments."" Dr Rebecca Moore, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said many women who experienced PTSD were being ""failed by the current provision"".  ""Many women who have had a traumatic birth in the UK are not diagnosed, misdiagnosed or cannot access rapid, specialist, trauma-specific treatment,"" she added. Kim Thomas, from the Birth Trauma Association, said: ""We have had women come to us who have had their traumatic birth experience 20 or 30 years ago and they are still experiencing the symptoms. ""If you don't get treatment then your symptoms can go on for years and years."" Sources of support for PTSD and birth trauma include: Ms Simpson suggested the therapy she went through had helped her recover.

1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46376123,"HIV diagnoses are continuing to fall in the UK as it meets UN targets on diagnosis, treatment and transmission for the first time, according to a report from Public Health England. It said there was no doubt prevention efforts to end the HIV epidemic were working.  New HIV diagnoses in the UK fell by 17% from 2016 to 2017, with spread among gay and bisexual men declining.   HIV charities said real progress was being made in the fight against HIV. Latest figures on HIV infections from PHE show that last year both England and the UK overall met three important targets of 90% set by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids (UNAids). Overall, 87% of people living with HIV in the UK were estimated to have an undetectable viral load and therefore be unable to infect others. Countries around the world were given a deadline of 2020 but the UK met the targets in 2017. The UK's success was down to more HIV testing, increased condom use and people starting their treatment sooner, PHE said. The availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (Prep), a daily pill that disables HIV before it gets a stranglehold in the body, could also be a factor. The report says there has been a steady downward trend in new HIV diagnoses for several years and in HIV transmission among the group most affected by the virus - men who have sex with men. In 2017, there were 4,363 new cases of HIV in the UK - 3,236 in men - and nearly half were diagnosed at a late stage. Prof Noel Gill, head of sexually transmitted infections and HIV at Public Health England, said prevention efforts were working.  But he said it was vital that people had an HIV test if they thought they were at risk because early diagnosis was key to stopping transmission. ""Our efforts must continue apace in order to eliminate HIV.   ""Treatment for HIV is freely available and highly effective, enabling people to live a long, healthy life.  ""There are now a variety of ways people can protect themselves from being infected with or passing on HIV, including use of condoms, Prep, regular HIV testing, and prompt initiation of antiretroviral treatment."" About 102,000 people are estimated to be living with HIV in the UK but some 8,000 (8%) are still thought to be unaware of their infection. Ian Green, chief executive of Terrence Higgins Trust, said it was ""fantastic news"" that the UK had reached the UN's targets. But he said a new and ambitious target was now needed. ""This is far from the end and it's time for us to be even more ambitious as we work towards ending new HIV transmissions entirely in the UK.  ""That's because we're at a pivotal moment and must not jeopardise progress made by being complacent."" Deborah Gold, chief executive of  the National Aids Trust said the UK was now a global leader on HIV. ""This is an extraordinary moment in the fight against HIV - in which everything seems possible.  ""With the right political will, investment and public support, we can eliminate HIV as a public health threat and make real progress towards the UN target to end HIV-related stigma.""",,,,

Despite multiple negative pregnancy tests, doctors insisted Keely Favell must be pregnant as her stomach grew in size. When asked questions about baby due dates, she spared people's embarrassment by playing along. But the 28-year-old believed herself to be ""just fat"". Ms Favell, from Swansea, started gaining weight in 2014. ""I've always been chunky, but over the course of a couple of years, I gradually got this tummy,"" she said. ""It crept up so slowly that I didn't know anything was wrong - I just thought I was putting on timber. ""I've been with my partner Jamie Gibbins for 10 years and we did wonder a few times if I was pregnant - but we did home tests and they always ruled it out."" She said it was ""so embarrassing"" explaining she was not pregnant: ""I'd go along with it to spare everyone the blushes."" After blacking out in her office admin job, Ms Favell plucked up the courage to see a GP in 2016, who said she must be pregnant despite blood negative tests. ""Looking at me, anyone would have thought I was nine months gone. ""It wasn't the first time I'd been mistaken for an expectant mum... People had seen me waddling around, carrying this lump, and I'd been asked a few times when I was due."" Still believing Ms Favell to be pregnant, her GP referred her for an ultrasound scan in January last year. ""I was lying there with Jamie beside me as the radiologist moved the probe over my tummy. I saw her eyes widen in horror, but the screen was just blank.  ""The look on her face said it all - something was wrong, and when she said she had to get a consultant I started to panic. Jamie did his best to reassure me but I felt paralysed with fear."" She was sent for an emergency CT scan which revealed a cyst surrounded by fluid. ""[The consultant] told me I wasn't fat all - I was actually quite thin."" Ms Favell was referred to a high-risk obstetrics consultant and examined in February last year.  ""By this time, even walking was a struggle and I had difficulty breathing. ""I'll never forget the look of shock on his face when the consultant examined me. He said I had a large ovarian mass and the only option was surgery. He couldn't say what it was, exactly, or how big."" The cyst was finally removed in March last year, and was revealed to be 26kg the weight of a seven or eight-year-old child - or seven average-sized newborn babies. ""They explained how big this cyst was and showed me the pictures - I couldn't believe I'd been walking around for so long carrying this medical alien. ""It looked like a massive pile of ice cream so I called it Mr Whippy."" Ms Favell has been left with a large scar and stretch marks, but will still be able to have children. ""I lost sight of how difficult even simple things like driving a car or walking up the stairs had become. Losing my lump gave me my life back - I can't thank my surgeon enough.""",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-46382662,"China has halted the work of the scientist who claims to have created the world's first genetically edited babies, and says it will investigate. He Jiankui caused outrage earlier this week when he told a genome summit he had altered the genes of twin baby girls so they could not contract HIV. His statement has not been confirmed, but if true breaks tight rules around the use of gene editing in humans. Prof He's university said it was unaware of his experiment. The Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen said earlier in the week he had been on unpaid leave since February, and it would be investigating the claims. On Thursday, China's science ministry said it had ""demanded that the relevant organisation suspend the scientific activities of relevant personnel"". The National Health Commission has already said Prof He's work ""seriously violates China's laws, regulations and ethical standards"" and would investigate the claims. Prof He announced that he had altered the DNA of embryos - twin girls known as Lulu and Nana - to prevent them from contracting HIV. Speaking to the Human Genome Editing Summit at the University of Hong Kong, he said the girls were ""born normal and healthy"" and they would be monitored over the next 18 years. He said he had funded the experiment himself and confirmed his university had not been aware of it. Prof He also explained that eight couples - comprised of HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers - had signed up voluntarily for the experiment. One couple dropped out, but there was ""another potential pregnancy"" of a gene-edited embryo in its early stages.  He said his study had been submitted to a scientific journal for review, though he did not name the journal. He was also evasive about other details, including the names of ""some experts"" he said had reviewed his work and offered feedback. The Crispr gene editing tool he claims to have used is not new to the scientific world, and was first discovered in 2012. It works by using ""molecular scissors"" to alter a very specific strand of DNA - either cutting it out, replacing it or tweaking it. Gene editing could potentially help avoid heritable diseases by deleting or changing troublesome coding in embryos. But experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes. Hundreds of scientists, both in China and around the world, swiftly condemned his claims. Professor Julian Savulescu, an ethics expert at the University of Oxford, said if true ""this experiment is monstrous"". ""Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer,"" he told the BBC. ""This experiment exposes healthy normal children to risks of gene editing for no real necessary benefit."" Many countries, including the UK, have laws that prevent the use of genome editing in embryos for assisted reproduction in humans. Scientists can do gene editing research on discarded IVF embryos, as long as they are destroyed immediately afterwards and not used to make a baby. China allows in-vitro human embryonic stem cell research for a maximum period of 14 days, China's Deputy Minister of Science and Technology Xu Nanping clarified.",,,,
1811,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46387167,"There has been a worldwide resurgence of measles, with many countries experiencing ""severe and protracted"" outbreaks last year, a report warns.  The World Health Organization data shows a rise in cases in almost every region of the world, with 30% more cases in 2017 than 2016.  Experts say complacency, collapsing health systems and a rise in fake news about the vaccine are behind the rise.  They say the measles vaccines can save millions of lives. Measles is a highly contagious disease that in severe cases can lead to complications such as blindness, pneumonia and infection and swelling of the brain.  The report, put together by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at measles cases over the past 17 years.  Experts say this is the first year there has been a sustained increase in cases, with 110,000 measles-related deaths.  And they are concerned that trends for 2018 are similar after cases reached a high in Europe in the summer.  The Americas, Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean region saw the greatest upsurge in cases. The Western Pacific region was the only area to see a decline. A large number of infections were seen in Venezuela, as health systems collapsed after political and economic crises. The country had previously eliminated the disease.  And there are now concerns that as more people move between countries in the region, the disease could continue to spread.  Meanwhile the Ukraine, Italy, France, Germany and Greece all saw an increase in cases in the past few years.  In the UK, which was declared free of the disease by the WHO last year, there have also been small outbreaks in 2018.  This led England's top doctor to urge parents to get their children vaccinated and ignore anti-vaccine myths. Dr Martin Friede, of the WHO, told the BBC that it was worrying that in a number of European countries parents were not vaccinating their children. He said: ""Probably in Europe, more than other regions, we are seeing vaccine hesitancy becoming more of a problem than elsewhere.  ""In some groups, this is driven by religious beliefs but in quite a few populations it is spread by false concerns about the safety of vaccines."" Dr Friede said that social media was playing a part in this and that new ways must be found to counter misinformation.  He said: ""Industrialised countries must not be complacent and forget that the disease can come back like a storm.  ""It doesn't take many unvaccinated children for that to happen and when it happens, measles is not just a rash - it can cause blindness and brain problems."" The report estimates that since 2000, the two doses of measles vaccines given to young children have saved more than 21 million lives.   But Dr Soumya Swaminathan, of the WHO, said: ""Without urgent efforts to increase vaccination coverage and identify populations with unacceptable levels of under- or unimmunized children, we risk losing decades of progress in protecting children and communities against this devastating but entirely preventable disease.""",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-46397877,"Harvey Davis comes to open the gate to his dusty, wind swept compound in the remote part of northern Namibia.  ""Welcome, welcome, it's been so long since we've had visitors,"" he exclaims at the two health workers. The 79-year-old summons his wife, Ruth Nasidengo, who is 40, from their home. She emerges with two babies, clinging to each arm.  This is the front line in Namibia's war against HIV, where a data-driven on-the-ground approach has helped it become one of the most successful countries in tackling its spread. The red-uniformed health workers are field officers, who report to a troop commander, who in turn is under a division commander. Rather than guns, their weapons are a small plastic table and a cooler bag filled with ice packs and HIV tests.  Leontine Iipinge and Maria Johannes have walked more than 3km (2 miles) from their base in the Oshana region to visit the couple. The initials TCE, meaning Total Control of Epidemic, stand out in bold letters on their shirts. It is a programme run by a national NGO, Development Aid from People to People (Dapp Namibia). The field workers are two of more than 200 TCE health workers serving a population of nearly 182,000. Mrs Nasidengo, a mother of twins, has been living with HIV for over a decade and has been a client of TCE for two years.  But this visit is about her husband as he is about to get his first home HIV test.  The ice packs in the cooler maintain the correct temperature for the rapid tests.  With his 11-month-old daughter, Dora, sitting on his lap Mr Davis watches as Ms Iipinge unpacks and disinfects her instruments and pricks his finger.  ""I'm not worried,"" he quips, ""but it sure looks like Dora is."" As the 15 minutes tick by before the result is known, Ms Iipinge explains how testing the partners of people with HIV helps contain the spread of the virus. Back at their base in Oshakati town, they compile data of all people known to be HIV-positive and then set about tracing their sexual partners to establish their HIV status. The rapid test looks for HIV antibodies in the blood and the results are indicated by stripes appearing in the window of the device. As Mr Davis and his daughter watch, a single stripe appears showing that he is HIV-negative (two stripes indicates a positive result). But he is still referred to a hospital as he needs to be given drugs that reduce the risk of contracting the virus from someone who is HIV-positive by 90%. TCE field officers have worked in this area for 14 years.  They have built community trust and respect but not everyone can be easily persuaded to take an HIV test.  The next stop for Ms Iipinge and Ms Johannes is about 12km away and they are heading to the home of Lucas Angula in the Evululuko township.  He found out that he was HIV-positive just last month, but it had taken his wife, Matilda Ipandula, 10 years to convince him to take the test:  'We would always fight and argue whenever I brought up the issue of HIV testing with my husband,"" she says.  ""He refused to listen and that's why I asked our neighbour to get involved. It was difficult but it had to be done.""  The neighbour, Emirita Kuutondokwa, now forms part of Mr Angula's trio, a support group made up of someone who is HIV-positive and two others. He says their encouragement has helped him deal with his diagnosis and take the drugs that help contain the spread of the virus. Support is a key ingredient to the success in containing the spread of HIV here. Close to Mr Angula's house, a small knot of people have gathered under a Marula fruit tree. They are singing a song, in the Oshiwambo language, about how they are the lucky ones.  This is what is known as a Community Adherence Club - a group of 12 people who are all HIV-positive.  They take turns to collect medication from the clinic 20km away. This frees the remaining 11 to get on with other things and avoids clogging up the clinic. After seeing to her clients, the division commander, Ms Johannes, joins the group to shake off the tension of the day as they dance around the tree.  ""When you get into this, it's first about the job and the salary but as you stay it becomes about the people and the passion,"" she says. ""I've had field officers here who have only stayed for five months because they feel what they get as a salary does not compensate the time they spend at work but the ones that stay, they have passion to be with the people, to work with the people, to improve the lives of the people."" Newly released data by the US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) shows it is this community-centred approach that has helped Namibia exceed some of the 90-90-90 targets set by UNAids in 2014.  The figures measure: For Namibia, the figures are 86%, 96% and 91% respectively. Its neighbour, South Africa, the country with the highest number of HIV infections in the world, scores 90-68-78. But Health Minister Dr Bernard Haufiku says now is not the time for complacency. ""There is a real possibility that we will be able to reach our target by the date set by UNAids [2020], we just have to give it a little bit of a push because we are almost there, just a few percentage left. We need to focus, especially on the prevention campaigns in the field, targeting young people that have not been tested."" Namibia used to have one of the highest HIV-prevalence rates in the world, but in the past 15 years, the number of new HIV infections has halved. But the high infection rate among young women aged 15-24 continues to worry health officials here.  The health minister adds that on the 30th anniversary of World Aids Day, on Saturday, he will be encouraging young men to get tested and treated.  In Namibia, it seems to be the older generation, men like Mr Davis and Mr Angula, who are setting the example. Ms Johannes hopes that at some point she will no longer have to deliver bad news to her clients. ""I remember there was a day in 2015,"" she says. ""My first six clients of the day all tested positive. Telling six people they're HIV-positive, without a break‚Ä¶ it's a day I'll never forget.""",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46399090,"There were around 50,100 excess winter deaths in England and Wales in 2017-18 - the highest since the winter of 1975-76, figures from the Office for National Statistics show. The increase is thought to be down to the flu, the ineffectiveness of the flu vaccine in older people and spells of very cold weather last winter. Most excess deaths occurred in women and the over-85s. Similar peaks in excess deaths have been seen in previous years. Before the 2017-18 peak in excess winter deaths, there were peaks in 2014-15 and 1999-2000. An extra 6,000 deaths are estimated to have occurred during last winter compared with three years ago. The figures for last winter, counted as December to March, are still provisional while figures for all other previous winters have been confirmed. Nick Stripe, head of health analysis and life events at the Office for National Statistics said: ""Peaks like these are not unusual - we have seen more than eight peaks during the last 40 years.  ""It is likely that last winter's increase was due to the predominant strain of flu, the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine and below average winter temperatures"". Last winter, two strains of flu - influenza A and B - were circulating. Despite more people over 65 getting a flu jab, the vaccine was more effective in younger people and could explain why flu had a greater impact on elderly people, the ONS said. This year, it is hoped that an enhanced flu vaccine for elderly people should perform better.  The ONS said the increases could also be explained partly by colder weather and lower temperatures, compared with the five-year average, in December, February and March. More than a third of the excess deaths were caused by respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia. GP surgeries and pharmacies should have all their stocks of the flu vaccine by now. Public Health England has advised all adults over 65 to have the vaccine as soon as possible.",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46302780,"Around the world, children are far more likely than ever before to develop food allergies.     Inquiries into the deaths of British teenagers after eating buttermilk, sesame and peanut have highlighted the sometimes tragic consequences. Last year, a six-year-old girl in Western Australia died as the result of a dairy allergy. The rise in allergies in recent decades has been particularly noticeable in the West. Food allergy now affects about 7% of children in the UK and 9% of those in Australia, for example. Across Europe, 2% of adults have food allergies. Life-threatening reactions can be prompted even by traces of the trigger foods, meaning patients and families live with fear and anxiety. The dietary restrictions which follow can become a burden to social and family lives.  While we can't say for sure why allergy rates are increasing, researchers around the world are working hard to find ways to combat this phenomenon. An allergy is caused by the immune system fighting substances in the environment that it should see as harmless, known as allergens. These innocent substances become targets, leading to allergic reactions.  Symptoms range from skin redness, hives and swelling to - in the most severe cases - vomiting, diarrhoea, difficulty breathing and anaphylactic shock.  Some of the most common foods for children to be allergic to are: The frequency of food allergy has increased over the past 30 years, particularly in industrialised societies. Exactly how great the increase is depends on the food and where the patient lives. For example, there was a five-fold increase in peanut allergies in the UK between 1995 and 2016. A study of 1,300 three-year-olds for the EAT Study at King's College London, suggested that 2.5% now have peanut allergies. Australia has the highest rate of confirmed food allergy.  One study found 9% of Australian one-year-olds had an egg allergy, while 3% were allergic to peanuts. The increase in allergies is not simply the effect of society becoming more aware of them and better at diagnosing them.  It is thought that allergies and increased sensitivity to foods are probably environmental, and related to Western lifestyles. We know there are lower rates of allergies in developing countries. They are also more likely to occur in urban rather than rural areas.  Factors may include pollution, dietary changes and less exposure to microbes, which change how our immune systems respond. Migrants appear to show a higher prevalence of asthma and food allergy in their adopted country compared to their country of origin, further illustrating the importance of environmental factors.  There is no single explanation for why the world is becoming more allergic to food, but science has some theories. One is that improved hygiene is to blame, as children are not getting as many infections.  Parasitic infections, in particular, are normally fought by the same mechanisms involved in tackling allergies. With fewer parasites to fight, the immune system turns against things that should be harmless. Another idea is that vitamin D can help our immune system develop a healthy response, making us less susceptible to allergies.  Most populations around the world do not get enough vitamin D for several reasons, including spending less time in the sun. In the US, the rate of vitamin D deficiency is thought to have almost doubled in just over a decade. A newer, ""dual allergen exposure"" theory, suggests food allergy development is down to the balance between the timing, dose and form of exposure.  For example, the development of the allergy antibodies can take place through the skin, particularly through inflamed skin in babies with eczema.  But it is thought that eating trigger foods during weaning can lead to a healthy response and prevent the allergy developing, because the gut's immune system is prepared to tolerate bacteria and foreign substances, such as food.  This was the basis for King's College London's LEAP Study, which showed about an 80% reduction in peanut allergy in five-year-old children who regularly ate peanut from the year they were born.  This study led to changes in US guidelines about peanut consumption in infancy. UK parents have been advised to consult their GP first. More like this The deaths of UK teenagers suffering from food allergies highlights the human impact of this condition, and the importance of clear and accurate labelling.  There is currently no cure for food allergy, and managing the condition relies on avoiding the offending foods and on an emergency treatment plan in case of exposure.  But even making an initial diagnosis is challenging. The main way to identify food allergies is for a patient to gradually eat increased amounts of that food under medical supervision. However, this is distressing for children, and has the risk of causing an allergic reaction. The accompanying tests of their immune systems' reaction can also give a false positive in non-allergic children. At King's College London we have developed an alternative; a blood test which has proved accurate in diagnosing peanut allergy compared with existing methods. These tests now cover the foods responsible for 90% of children's allergies, and will hopefully be available to patients in the next couple of years. Even following a successful diagnosis, avoiding trigger foods is difficult and accidental reactions are common. Allergen immunotherapy - administering small amounts of the substance - has been shown to reduce the sensitivity of allergic patients and can protect against accidental exposure.  A recent immunotherapy drug trial found 67% of peanut-allergic subjects could consume the equivalent of two peanut kernels after a year, compared to 4% of the control group. Nevertheless, they are still allergic. Other treatments are being investigated for food allergy, and are much needed.  In the meantime, allergies will remain a source of worry and part of daily life for the children and their parents.

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46388248,"Babies who are born with a wide variety of bacteria in their nose are more likely to recover quickly from their first cold, research suggests. It is hoped the findings may help in the fight against the common cold. The common cold is caused by a virus, but scientists want to understand how such illnesses are affected by natural bacteria in the respiratory tract. The study may also indicate why infants who suffer from lots of colds are more at risk of developing asthma later on. ""The respiratory tract is home to a wide variety of bacteria and we are beginning to understand that the types and numbers of these bacteria - what we refer to as the microbiota - can influence our respiratory health,"" said Dr Roland P Neumann from University Children's Hospital, Basel. Researchers based their results on swabs taken from 167 babies.  The swabs were taken as soon as the infants developed the first signs of a cold - and then again three weeks later. Scientists analysed the swabs by testing for the presence of respiratory viruses, such as the common cold, and for the types and numbers of different bacteria present. Researchers also considered other factors which can affect respiratory health, including the time of year and the baby's age at the point of their first cold, whether the infant had siblings or attended nursery, and whether they were regularly exposed to cigarette smoke. The study, published in ERJ Open Research, suggests that babies who have a wide variety of different bacteria living in their nose tend to recover more quickly from their first respiratory virus. By comparison, those who have less variety and more bacteria from either the Moraxellaceae or Streptococcaceae family recover more slowly. Previous studies have shown a similar link between bacteria found in these family groups and the development of respiratory disease in adulthood. Researchers have suggested two possible explanations for the link between nose-dwelling bacteria and respiratory infection:  The research was part of a larger study that is following a group of babies from birth to investigate the complex interactions of genetic and environmental factors and their influence on lung health. In the longer term, it could help determine ""what healthy microbiota is - and if there is an opportunity to influence it"", with probiotics for example, although Dr Neumann stressed such a conclusion was purely speculative at this stage. Prof Tobias Welte, President of the European Respiratory Society, who was not involved in the study, welcomed further research. ""There is an association between respiratory symptoms in babies in the first year of life and the development of asthma by school age.  ""We do not yet fully understand this link but the bacteria living in the upper airways could play a role.  ""We need to do more research to understand the relationship between these bacteria, respiratory infections and long-term lung health.""",,,,

Photographer Sayan Hazra spent more than a year chronicling the lives of residents at one such care home in southern India. There are more than 100 million Indians over the age of 60, according to the 2011 census. And their future is uncertain as the Indian family has changed significantly in the past few decades. Large, joint families have increasingly given way to smaller, nuclear ones; and a large number of Indians no longer live in the same cities or the same country as their parents.  ""I can't hear or walk properly,"" says Sumati, 76, one of the residents in the care home. Ms Sumati, like the others, says she preferred to use her first name only to protect her identity.  She suffers from partial speech problems, diabetes and hypertension.  She spent most of her life taking care of her family but she says it's best for her to live in a care home now. Traditionally, children have cared for their ageing parents. But in the past decade, the number of elderly Indians who willingly or unwillingly spend the last few years of their lives in care homes has gone up.   ""What will I do if I go back home? I don't want to burden my children,"" adds Ms Sumati. Eighty-year-old Parameswar, who moved to the care home five years ago, says he can't sleep well most nights.   ""When your family doesn't support you in your old age, these homes give you a place to stay and food to eat for the rest of your days,"" he says.  His wife, who he was married to for 50 years, died about three years ago. He often talks about how much he misses her.   Mr Parameswar has also lost vision in his left eye. But he still enjoys reading the newspaper every day. His face lights up at the mention of politics or sports.  He also practises yoga on most mornings.  Sarada, 93, ended up in a care home after her husband died.  At first, she divided her time between the homes of her two sons, living for six months with each of their families. Before they went on a holiday, they would drop her at a care home. But gradually, Ms Sarada says, she began to feel that she was ""unwanted"". So she decided to move into a care home permanently.  ""I never thought I'd have to stay in a care home,"" she adds. ""I don't want anything from life now - I am just counting my days here until I die."" The residents of the care home spend time with each other, often eating meals together like they used to with their families.  ""Even though I don't like staying here, we all need a place to live in and some food to eat - especially when we're this old,"" Ms Sarada says. She is fond of reading - both novels as well as religious books - and that keeps her busy all day.  ""Change is the law of the universe,"" says Satyanarayan, 80, who started living in the care home five years ago - he had difficulty adjusting to life at the home and living with strangers.  He says he moved into the home because his family could no longer take care of him. He adds that he doesn't meet his family anymore.  ""You can become a millionaire or a beggar in an instant. But life moves on,"" he says. Nagaraj moved into the care home four years ago after he was diagnosed with elephantiasis, a disease which causes severe and painful swelling in the limbs. He says his family told him that they could no longer care for him.  He loved music and he spent hours listening to the radio in his room.  ""Life and death is in god's hands,"" he told Mr Hazra who met him earlier this year. ""We are merely puppets dancing on his directions.""  He died in March, four days after he stopped taking medicines and eating food. He was 62.  Susheela, 102, clutches her prayer beads and chants mantras through the day. She also sings. She says that she remembers details of her early life but isn't comfortable talking about her family.  When 67-year-old Laxmi, who had been living in the care home for two years, died in June 2018, no-one came to claim her body. So staff at the home performed her funeral rites.  All that is left when the residents pass away is the mundane and intimate evidence of the life they lived - a phone, a watch, a radio. Sayan Hazra is a photographer based in India. The name of the care home and the last names of its residents have been withheld upon their request.",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46206789,"When Colin McIntyre was told by the NHS he would have to wait nine months for a new hip he decided to look at other options. The 65-year-old went to France for his operation and to his surprise he got the money back from the NHS. Colin, from Glasgow, says his problems started about three years ago.   He was a regular at the gym, went dancing and played squash five times a week but his right hip was starting to give him ""some gip"". It was diagnosed as osteoarthritis. He was told it would gradually get worse in the coming months but surgery was said to be ""the last option"" for him. Over the next few months it got much worse. He had to give up all his sports and began to struggle to walk because of the pain. Colin says: ""I can remember sitting at my desk one day with one of my clients and he was looking at me and he said 'you know, you just look so unhappy and you're just obviously in pain'.  ""And that became the norm, and it affects everything.  It affects relationships, it affects the home, the way you look at things in general.""   Unhappy with his NHS diagnosis, Colin went to see a private consultant who told him he had ""absolutely no cartilage"" in his right hip. The consultant referred Colin back to the NHS waiting list for a hip replacement operation and he quickly received a letter guaranteeing treatment within 12 weeks. The letter said he would be offered an appointment before 16 February 2017. However, about halfway through his 12-week wait he got a phone call from the hospital that advised him it was going to take eight or nine months. ""I said to the lady 'why have you sent out this letter?',"" Colin says. ""She said 'well it's a legal requirement, we have to send the letter'.   ""So I then said so you're going to send me another letter explaining all this?  And she said no we don't send out other letters, we just make phone calls."" Colin says he was shocked that the 12-week treatment ""guarantee"" detailed in the Patients' Rights Scotland Act was ""not worth the paper it is written on"". He decided he could not spend nine months in pain and looked for an alternative. He checked out the cost of having the operation done privately by the consultant he had seen earlier. It was going to be between ¬£10,000 and ¬£12,000. There is nothing to stop patients going anywhere in the world for an operation if they are prepared to pay. But the cost is a major issue as well as concerns over the quality of the operation. Colin says: ""At the time I was speaking to different people and they were saying 'you look terrible' and then one of my clients said to me, 'I know someone who is going to France to have his hip done'."" Colin got the phone number of the man having his operation in France and kept in touch. ""He was extremely impressed with it and for me that was better than any kind of written testimonial on the internet, or whatever,"" he says. Colin contacted the surgery in France and got more information.   ""I was told that if you have your EHIC (European Health Insurance Card) it was going to cost ¬£3,450,"" he says.   ""If I didn't have that card, it would have been about ¬£10,000.""   ""At that point I thought 'Well, I'm fortunate I could afford that'. ""I was going to have to pay for flights and maybe a little bit for hotel accommodation but it wasn't going to be ¬£10,000 or ¬£12,000.""   Within two weeks, he was in France having the operation. He says: ""I had the operation on the Wednesday morning, and the pain just went completely which was for me the best thing and then within two days I was on crutches, being shown how to walk up and down stairs. ""I was driving again within about two and a half weeks. It was just unbelievable.   ""I gave myself six months to fully recover before I played any kind of racketball but I was going back to the gym because I'd always been doing that kind of stuff."" Colin says he thinks about his decision in terms of paying to get back seven or eight months of his life. He paid for his operation in France upfront but his doctor told him he would be able to reclaim some of the cost from the NHS. ""He actually filled in a form which he had, I think the version he had was from NHS Lothian, and you're just giving all your details, all the procedure, whatever,"" Colin says. In one of his letters of complaint about the delay, Colin had already told NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that he would send them the bill, although he says this was ""tongue in cheek"".  He says: ""When I sent the bill, within days I got a phone call from a very nice lady who turned out to be a doctor. ""She said that's fine but we need the bill broken down into what's the medical part and the non-medical part.""   Colin says: ""So I went back to Laurent [the surgeon], he got me a broken itemised bill, ¬£2,300 for the medical part, ¬£950 for his facilitating fee and a couple of hundred quid for hotels. ""I sent them the bill and again within days the same lady phoned back and said 'that's fine, you'll get a cheque within two weeks'.   ""Literally I got the cheque for ¬£2,300 within two days. Unbelievable."" A BBC Scotland Freedom of Information request found that at least 318 procedures abroad had been funded by Scottish health boards over the past five years. Colin was reimbursed under the EU Cross-Border Healthcare Directive, meaning the health board paid back the cost of the procedure and hospital care, equivalent to what it would have cost the NHS to carry out the surgery. He says most people he talks to, including people in the NHS, do not know about the agreement. ""I was amazed because that was obviously just the cherry on the cake,"" he says. ""The fact I'd had the operation, the fact it had gone so well, the fact that I had my life back, that was worth it but to get the money back, that was just - it's totally unexpected.""

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-46430250,"Canada has become a hot destination for parents-to-be looking for ""altruistic surrogates"" - women who give birth to babies they are not genetically related to and only charge pregnancy-related expenses in return.  Marissa Muzzell spent 16 hours in labour to deliver a baby girl. She suffered from acute morning sickness during her pregnancy and had to be hospitalised twice. She underwent months of daily hormone injections and previously endured four failed embryo transfers. She did all of this for a baby that is not hers. Marissa, 32, is a surrogate in Canada, where hundreds of women like her volunteer to give birth to children that will then go home with somebody else. ""I've just created [a] family‚Ä¶ someone else's family,"" says Marissa laughing, still recovering in the delivery room after handing over the newborn to the baby's parents - a same-sex couple from Spain. See also: The corner of Europe where women rent out their wombs There is a steady surge in demand for surrogacy globally. Canada has experienced dramatic growth in the practice, with some estimates suggesting an increase of more than 400% in the past decade. Surrogacy here is ""altruistic"" - meaning the women who carry the babies cannot make a financial gain out of it. Canada is not the only country where this type of surrogacy is the norm - this is also the case in the UK, for example. But the legislation in most Canadian provinces makes it easier for intended parents to obtain legal parenthood of a surrogate baby. Also, unlike some other countries,  Canada opens this practice to same-sex couples and single parents. Altruistic surrogacy is more ethically acceptable for some and also a lot cheaper, compared to countries where surrogacy is commercial, such as the US. ""I see a lot of American surrogates who get paid thousands of dollars just to get pregnant, whereas in Canada we don't do that,"" says Marissa. Here, surrogates only get reimbursed a capped amount of pregnancy-related expenses, like antenatal vitamins, maternity clothes, groceries and travel costs for medical appointments, as well as lost wages if they take time off work due to medical reasons. And they need to produce a receipt for every expense they claim. ""This is not an income that you can save, we're not baby machines,"" says Marissa, who works as a youth worker. ""To me that made it that much more special. You're not doing it as a job, but from the kindness of your heart""  Canadian surrogates are gestational carriers, which means that the embryo transferred into their womb is created in a lab with someone else's egg, never their own. There are at least 900 active surrogates, according to estimates from Canadian media - and official statistics are hard to come by. ""Eleven years ago, when I started the company, we had eight [surrogate] babies born in a year. In the last month alone we've had over 30 babies born,"" says Leia Swanberg, founder of Canadian Fertility Consultancy, one of the largest surrogacy agencies in the country. The volunteers must undergo medical and psychological evaluations, and need to have given birth to at least one child of their own. Ms Swanberg, a former surrogate herself, vets them and helps match them with intended parents across the world. ""It is like online dating,"" says two-time surrogate Janet Harbick, 33, who is currently pregnant with a baby girl. ""You have to fill in a profile, then you get sent profiles from intended parents"". ""It is always hard. There are more couples than surrogates, so you feel very responsible. How do I choose? There's a connection, you simply feel it when you first make contact."" Janet had her first surrogate baby last year for a French couple, and then became pregnant again just four months after giving birth. ""I've already thought of doing two more, a sibling journey for each couple I've had a baby for, to give them brothers or sisters,"" she says. ""I love being pregnant and my body heals well, so why not? I will keep on doing it for as long as my body allows."" Like her, many surrogates volunteer multiple times. Most also keep in contact with the families they help create. ""These guys [the intended parents] start off as strangers, then they become friends, eventually they become family,"" says Janet.  ""They are uncles to my kids, and I'm in my 'surro' baby's life for the long run."" These women agree that surrogacy is a life-changing experience, which may partly explain why they give up their time and put their bodies at potential risk. ""I cannot imagine life without kids,"" says mother-of-five Janet.  ""My tubes are tied and I don't want any more, but I love the feeling that I'm able to produce this for someone who couldn't have it any other way."" Marissa says: ""I think it's just bringing light back into the world. I'm creating a child for these gentlemen but I'm also creating a legacy."" Yet the road to having a surrogate baby can be lengthy and tough. Multiple rounds of IVF, failed embryo transfers and miscarriages are common.  ""I was very, very sick during the pregnancy, so my husband had to cover for me. He was super-supportive and so were my kids,"" says Janet. ""In my case, my fianc√© gave me a hard time - he never understood why I was doing this,"" adds Marissa. Being from a small rural town, she also found it difficult to avoid criticism from neighbours. ""I got a lot of: 'How could you give up that baby?' 'Why are you sacrificing your family life for a baby that you won't bring home?'  ""So if you want to be a surrogate, you need to stick to your guns. It's your body, your choice."" Criticism of surrogacy is not uncommon. Within feminism, for example, there is a school of thought that views it as a form of exploitation of the female body. Academic Katy Fulfer, from the University of Waterloo, conducts research into surrogacy and says even though surrogacy in Canada is unpaid it does not mean there is no exploitation. ""I think comparing surrogacy and prostitution is appropriate, as you have two forms of embodied labour that people are selling,"" she says.  ""The fact that women don't get paid is problematic, because fertility here is a for-profit industry and everyone else gets paid. Why isn't the surrogate getting paid?"" Within the altruistic model, surrogates only get expenses reimbursed while agencies, doctors, lawyers and fertility clinics are paid a fee - making it an expensive endeavour for intended parents that may cost more than C$75,000  ($56,767; ¬£44,600). The model is highly regulated. A few years ago agency owner Leia Swanberg became the only woman ever to be charged under Canada's law governing surrogacy. She pleaded guilty to failing to keep track of all receipts for compensation paid out to the surrogates at her agency and was fined. There is currently a big push to change this legislation. ""As compensation is banned, even sending flowers to a surrogate could expose intended parents to criminal liability,"" she says. A breach could lead to fines of up to C$500,000 ($378,450; ¬£297,300) or a 10-year jail sentence.  ""In truth, it would be good to have more relaxed regulations and not have to collect receipts, but it's not a big deal. We are not in this for the money,"" says Janet. ""I'm proud, very proud that I'm able to carry this child."" ""You are making brand new parents,"" adds Marissa.  ""I handed this baby back to them with joy, because this baby was never mine"". ""Think of surrogacy as extreme babysitting. In the end, the baby gets to go home to its parents. There isn't much more to it than that.""

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-46427500,"A woman convicted of illegally whitening people's teeth has told BBC Scotland she did not know what she was doing was against the law. The General Dental Council (GDC) says only registered dentists should carry out teeth whitening. But private companies offer training in how to oversee the procedure. Brenda McFadyen, from Clydebank, was fined ¬£1,000 after she pled guilty to the illegal practice of dentistry at Glasgow Sheriff Court last month.  The 63-year-old said she was angry that she had been prosecuted and she now wants to warn others not to get involved in offering teeth whitening products and services. Celebrity culture and reality shows such as The Only Way is Essex have contributed to a big growth in the popularity of teeth whitening treatments. The procedure involves bleaching your teeth using a whitening product usually containing hydrogen peroxide. Figures suggest one in eight Scots have had their teeth whitened but it is against the law for anyone who is not registered with the GDC, which regulates the UK dental industry, to practise dentistry. But Ms McFadyen said she did not know she was doing something illegal until the police knocked on her door in Clydebank on a Saturday night earlier this year. ""I had been teeth whitening for three or four years. In my eyes I wasn't doing anything illegal but I had to go to court and plead guilty and I was hit with a ¬£1,000 fine,"" she told BBC Scotland.  ""It was just a bit of extra income. We are both retired, you're trying your best to get on in life. And at my age, this is what I've had to go through.  ""They've taken my name and they've ruined it."" Ms McFadyen was prosecuted under the Dentists Act 1984 after the GDC employed private detectives to gather evidence that she was whitening teeth. The GDC told BBC Scotland it was protecting public safety.  Head of criminal enforcement, Katie Spears, praised the fine handed to Ms McFadyen and said it reflected the ""seriousness"" of the offence. Dentists regularly carry out teeth whitening but private companies also train people in how to oversee the procedure.  The GDC has not brought any cases against training companies but it has prosecuted 31 individuals across the UK this year. Ms Spears added: ""There are big training providers who try to mislead members of the public into signing up to their training courses and buying their equipment and they make claims which are simply not true. ""The law in relation to tooth whitening is very clear and the only way you can have it safely done is through a registered dentist.""  It is unclear how many people are injured as a result of illegal teeth whitening and there is no suggestion that any of Ms McFadyen's clients were harmed. BBC Scotland spoke to the dental hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee where the most serious cases would be treated. None of them had any referrals in relation to teeth whitening in the past year. But dentist Jaspal Purba, from Bupa Dental Care, has treated patients who have come to him with complications. ""Allergies alone can be quite serious and can be life threatening if they begin to affect your airways,"" he said.  ""I have seen a few cases of allergic reaction and swelling of the lips and the tongue. ""But the most common complications I have seen, if someone has not had a custom-made tray, is burns of the lining of the mouth and the gums."" Ms McFadyen said she is still struggling to come to terms with what happened and she wants to warn others against getting involved in teeth whitening. ""Nobody should be out doing this,"" she said. ""There will be someone out there who will come for them and they (the GDC) will come sooner rather than later.""",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46426063,"Experts advising the government have said there is not enough scientific evidence to warrant a ban on the sale of energy drinks to children. But the Science and Technology Committee said concerns in society, and evidence from teachers, could ""justify a ban."" The MPs recommended more prominent labels, saying the drinks were not suitable for children. Critics said they were disappointed not to see a recommendation for a ban.  A number of big supermarkets already ban their sale to under-16s due to concerns over the levels of sugar and caffeine in them.  In August the government launched a public consultation into whether to make it illegal to sell energy drinks to children. Young people in the UK are the biggest consumers of energy drinks in Europe for their age group.  Chairman of the cross-party committee, Norman Lamb, said they had heard a range of concerns which ""varied from a lack of concentration in the classroom and hyperactivity, to the effects on physical health"". He added it was ""clear from the evidence we received that disadvantaged children are consuming energy drinks at a higher rate than their peers."" But the committee found there was ""insufficient evidence"" as to whether children's consumption habits are significantly different for energy drinks than for other caffeinated drinks like tea and coffee.  The MPs did find drinking energy drinks correlated with young people engaging in other risky behaviours such as drinking alcohol and smoking, but said it wasn't ""possible to determine whether there is any causal link"".  Norman Lamb said: ""It would be legitimate for the Government to go beyond the evidence that is available at the moment and implement a statutory ban based on societal concerns and evidence, such as the experience of school teachers and pupils. If the Government decides to introduce a ban, it should explain why it has come to this decision."" The committee called on the Government to commission independent research to see whether energy drinks are more harmful than other soft drinks. The MPs also supported the idea of exclusion zones of sales to children around schools.  They said that despite statutory labelling on energy drinks that they are not recommended for children, ""a significant number of young people continue to consume these products, and some in excessive amounts."" leading to concerns that children and their parents do not fully understand what they are consuming.  The committee said the Government should use the opportunity of leaving the EU to introduce additional - more prominent - labelling requirements on energy drinks.  Professor Russell Viner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said it was ""disappointing not to see a recommendation today to ban the sale of these drinks to children. ""We believe that the evidence is already compelling that energy drinks bring no benefits and only harm to children.""  The committee members said they had heard from a number of witnesses who argued that the low cost of energy drinks made them more accessible to children. Prof Viner said the Government should introduce ""a minimum price for energy drinks as we know their cheap price tag is a key driver for their purchase"". The NASUWT Teachers Union gave evidence to the enquiry. Chris Keates, general secretary said: ""Teachers and school leaders continue to see first-hand the contribution energy drinks can make to poor pupil behaviour and pupils' ability to concentrate in class."" The union said the voluntary bans implemented by retailers were ""helpful"" but don't go far enough, and ""a blanket ban is needed.""",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46358999,"Welsh scientists are leading the world in identifying the flu strains that will circulate in the UK and Europe this winter. Samples taken from patients in hospitals and surgeries across the country are being examined. The speed of the analysis means Wales is at the forefront of the global mapping of flu as it progresses. The DNA sequences of the virus can now be identified within 24 hours by researchers in Cardiff. This means Rhyl, Neath, Penarth and Swansea sit alongside Hong Kong and New Mexico as locations providing the latest data to scientists tracking how flu spreads and evolves across the globe. The hope is to be able to predict more accurately the strain of flu which develops - and help towards producing a vaccine for next year's flu season. You might be interested in these stories: Dr Tom Connor, bioinformatics lead for the Public Health Wales' pathogen informatics unit, said the majority of samples submitted so far have come from Wales. ""That's particularly important because we're early on in the season and need to understand how flu will change and evolve,"" he said. ""Colleagues in the US and Switzerland have been very impressed.""  Joanne Watkins, biomedical scientist at the unit, based at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, added: ""To be able to look at the RNA - the chain of cells which carries genetic information about viruses - we can see what is circulating in Wales, we are able to identify if the vaccine is going to be successful in reducing the virus in the flu season.""  Dr Connor added: ""Most of the cases we've seen so far are H1N1 - a particular type of influenza - and it gives us an idea of how the flu might evolve over the course of this season  but we can also feed that information to global databases, which help inform vaccine development.""  The opportunity to have an impact on a worldwide scale was ""phenomenal"", he added. Last year was one of the most challenging flu seasons in almost a decade, while excess winter deaths almost doubled in Wales. This was largely because one of the main types of flu circulating was the H3N2 strain, which had a greater impact on more vulnerable and elderly patients. Last year's vaccine also was less effective against that strain. It led to more deaths and extra pressure on NHS services like GPs and A&E departments. Developing better ways of tracking and analysing flu is one of several priority areas for the Public Health Wales team - after receiving funding as part of the Welsh NHS genomics for precision medicine plan.  Catherine Moore, consultant clinical virologist, is hopeful that one day we might develop better vaccines. ""Flu tends to change and we'll always have this constant battle between our immune response and the virus wanting to survive,"" she said. ""We might not have vaccines which last for life but for a longer period of time and you might only need a booster very few years, depending on how the virus is going.""",,,,

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46439892,"The overwhelming majority of adults in England are so unhealthy they put their lives at risk, a survey suggests. The data from the Health Survey for England showed nearly nine in 10 had at least one unhealthy trait. That was classed as those who smoke, drink more than 14 units of alcohol, eat fewer than five portions of fruit and vegetables, are obese or have low rates of physical activity. Half of adults have two or more of these risk factors. Although there are signs some people are giving up some of the unhealthy traits. The survey from NHS Digital has been published as the Office for National Statistics revealed the latest death rates linked to alcohol. In 2017, nearly 7,700 people died in the UK from alcohol-specific causes - where the death was wholly attributable. That is the equivalent to 12.2 deaths per 100,000 people - the highest rate since 2008. Of the four UK nations, Scotland had the highest rate. The annual survey asked 8,000 adults and 2,000 children about their lifestyles. For the first time, it has compared the lifestyles of children with their parents. It suggested children who have obese parents were around three times more likely to be obese than children of healthy weight parents. Some 28% of children of an obese mother were also obese, compared with 8% of children whose mother was a healthy weight. Meanwhile, 24% of children of an obese father were also obese, compared with 9% of children where the father was not overweight or obese. Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, said the findings highlighted the need to tackle the ""increasingly obesogenic environments"". ""Children today are bombarded by promotions for unhealthy food and drinks in stores and on the high street and exposed to countless junk food adverts online and during the TV programmes they watch most."" Yes. Cigarette use is falling. In 1993 27% of adults were smokers, last year it was down to 17% with growing numbers turning to vaping. Drinking alcohol to excess is also down. It means the most common unhealthy lifestyle trait is low fruit and vegetable consumption. Although there are high levels of unhealthy lifestyles, around four in 10 adults have no signs of ill-health developing yet.  This was classed as conditions such as high blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels. There are also strong signs that children are becoming healthier - or at least demonstrating less risky behaviours. Last year just 5% of eight to 15-year-olds had tried smoking, down from 19% in 1997. The numbers trying alcohol have dropped from 45% in 2003 to 14% in 2017.",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-46436300,"Police in China have cracked down on a supply network of unlicensed and counterfeit beauty products, state media said. About 30m yuan ($4.3m, ¬£3.4m) worth of fake Botox and vitamin C injections, as well as illegally imported hyaluronic acid were sold by the network in a six month period, said Xinhua news agency. Authorities have charged five people in connection with the case. Counterfeit beauty products are thought to be widespread across China. Authorities first found the products in September last year after a snap inspection of a beauty parlour in Changde city.  The products being sold at the salon were traced back to a supplier in Jilin province - identified only as Zuo - who was selling them via messaging app WeChat. Police raided Zuo's warehouse and found over 2,300 bottles of hyaluronic acid - often used in skincare products - among other counterfeit beauty products.  They also found Zuo's shipping records - which showed that products had been sent to customers in 10 different provinces. Zuo, along with at least two other suspects, have been arrested for selling fake and unregulated products.  China is one of the world's biggest markets for plastic surgery and there is also booming demand for non-invasive treatments. Chinese authorities have previously warned about the dangers of fake beauty products after patients ended up in hospital following beauty procedures which went wrong.  Several cases have involved illegally imported products that have not been stored properly and are often administered in unsafe ways.",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46440143,"Michelle Obama's remarks about impostor syndrome - a term used to describe feelings of insecurity or self-doubt, despite there being no evidence to support such a belief -  have inspired others to share their experiences. When Sophie Montagne applied to be a part of the Ice Maiden expedition in Antarctica, she didn't think she would make the cut. She applied whilst working in marketing, and saw a poster about the trip at an army reserve unit where she attends part-time. ""The group of applicants was gradually whittled down from 250 applicants to the final six, in a process that lasted two years. ""During this time I was so crippled by impostor syndrome that I nearly took myself out of the running for the team - I was just somebody that sat at a desk doing marketing. Why did I think I could be part of a record breaking team in the coldest place on earth?! ""It affected how I behaved, my sense of self and, most importantly, my confidence.  ""Everyone else seemed to be more of an athlete and was in the army full-time.  ""When the team was announced it was vindication that someone has seen me as being valuable. It gave me a spine of confidence. ""As part of the selection I spoke to a psychologist who helped me to identify why I felt like a fraud - I could finally put a name to it.  ""I now speak about my experiences in Antarctica and about impostor syndrome specifically to companies and schools. I had never done public speaking before. ""I help them try to find ways to encourage young girls into sport and am very open about my imposter syndrome and how I dealt with it.""  Psychotherapist Rachel Buchan describes impostor syndrome as ""an internal belief that you are not good enough or don't belong"".  She says the feeling is most commonly found in the workplace but can also manifest itself in other areas of life like social situations. It can affect people of all backgrounds, she says, and emerges for a variety of reasons including someone's upbringing, background and specific circumstances at the time.  Consultant Noel Ferguson says he has impostor syndrome but instead of trying to overcoming it, he has used it to his advantage.  Growing up in ""a working class background in Belfast, during the Troubles,"" and looking after his elderly parents who were ill during a time when he himself became ill with cancer, he underperformed academically and that led him to feel he wasn't good enough.  ""I have tried to take my impostor syndrome and use it for a directed purpose,"" says Noel who later did Open University courses in Leadership and Management.  ""I was always aware I had it but I didn't know what it was.  ""Many see it as a burden but I have used it to my benefit. I am thankful I have impostor syndrome because a way of dealing with it is to always strive to be better. ""There's nothing wrong for men to admit they have it."" Noel started the Institute for One World Leadership and encourages people to be better leaders.  ""When I give talks to students I like to share personal experiences. Lots of people have imposter syndrome and think they are the only ones. ""For people with impostor syndrome, you will always be searching for ways to improve your performance, extend your abilities, and be better at what you do."" Kate Atkin is a professional speaker and delivers workshops on impostor syndrome, which she is researching for her PhD.  As the only woman on her managerial team in her previous career at Barclays she experienced impostor syndrome herself and shares tips for overcoming it:  Doreen Anselm-Etienne from Cambridgeshire told the BBC that when she was the only black manager in a team in the NHS she had a ""constant feeling"" of not belonging.  ""My role involved working closely with mainly doctors and consultants, the majority of whom were white middle-class males. ""For about five to six years I had the constant feeling that I didn't belong, that I had got the job by default, I wasn't smart enough, I wasn't good enough, my grasp of the English language was inadequate, as I had a Caribbean accent.  ""The HR consultant once told me to just keep telling myself every day: 'I'm the manager, I'm the manager'.  ""I don't know if I overcame it but having the support of some of my colleagues and my successes helped.  ""But it was a constant urge to keep doing better, keep working harder. It wasn't so much about being the best but an attempt to keep up with people I wrongly perceived to be better, smarter, or more intelligent than I am."" ""Feeling like an impostor hasn't really left me - I've just developed a thicker skin, and age has brought with it a level of confidence."" Interviews by Andree Massiah, UGC & Social News team",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46438396,"A healthy baby girl has been born using a womb transplanted from a dead person.  The 10-hour transplant operation - and later fertility treatment - took place in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, in 2016. The mother, 32, was born without a womb. There have been 39 womb transplants using a live donor, including mothers donating their womb to their daughter, resulting in 11 babies.  But the 10 previous transplants from a dead donor have failed or resulted in miscarriage.  In this case, reported in The Lancet, the womb donor was a mother of three in her mid-40s who died from bleeding on the brain.  The recipient had Mayer-Rokitansky-K√ºster-Hauser syndrome, which affects about one in every 4,500 women and results in the vagina and uterus (womb) failing to form properly.  However, her ovaries were fine. And doctors were able to remove eggs, fertilise them with the father-to-be's sperm and freeze them.  The woman was given drugs that weakened her immune system to prevent her body attacking and rejecting the transplant. And about six weeks later, she started having periods.  After seven months, the fertilised eggs were implanted.  And, after a normal pregnancy, a 6lb (2.5kg) baby was delivered by Caesarean section on 15 December 2017.  Dr Dani Ejzenberg, from Hospital das Cl√≠nicas in S√£o Paulo, said: ""The first uterus transplants from live donors were a medical milestone, creating the possibility of childbirth for many infertile women with access to suitable donors and the needed medical facilities.  ""However, the need for a live donor is a major limitation as donors are rare, typically being willing and eligible family members or close friends."" Dr Srdjan Saso, from Imperial College London, said the results were ""extremely exciting"". ""It enables use of a much wider potential donor population, applies lower costs and avoids live donors' surgical risks.""",,,,

The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme meets the people who are inserting technology under their skin, adopting extreme diets and trying to change their DNA. Liviu Babitz wants to create new human senses. Touch his chest and you feel his first effort, a vibration every time he faces north. If some animals can already sense direction, why shouldn't we? He can feel north because of an electronic implant on his chest called the ""North Sense"". It includes a compass chip, Bluetooth connection and is attached to the skin with two titanium bars like a piercing. Liviu, 38, is the chief executive of his own company, Cyborgnest, which designed the implant. He sees this as the first step in an entirely in-built navigation system and hopes to end what he calls ""generation screen"". ""You walk on the street staring at your phone. You want to get somewhere but you have no idea what's happened in the world around you because all you did was stare at the screen on the way,"" he says. ""Imagine if you didn't need it, you could navigate the world exactly like a bird and you would know exactly where you were all the time - blind people could navigate."" 'Biologically fluid' His invention is highly unusual but actually seems tame in comparison with Rich Lee, a 40-year-old cabinet-maker from St George, in the US state of Utah.  Rich is a grinder - a biohacker that does extreme body modification. In his fingers, he has magnets and two near-field communication (NFC) chips that can be programmed to link to websites or open car doors, among other tasks.  He has a biotherm chip in his forearm, which can constantly monitor body temperature (but are usually used in pets), and headphone implants right in his ears.  Find more: Watch Catrin's full film here. He has also attempted ""Crispr"" - probably the most extreme and controversial kind of biohacking, a technique used by scientists to target and edit your genes. While scientists are still working out the limits and dangers, Rich is experimenting at home and admits if he gets it wrong, he could kill himself. ""We've got all this genetic engineering knowledge and what I'm backing is the concept of being able to change your genes or get genetic modification like you would get a tattoo,"" he says.  ""I want to see a biologically fluid society where people can just augment these things."" This home biohacking can of course go very badly wrong - Rich pulls up his trouser legs to reveal a selection of scars from implanted shin guards that got so swollen they had to be removed, which he did with pliers and no painkillers.  Concussion Luke Robert Mason, director of the Virtual Futures organisation, says there is a great deal of excitement around biohacking but ""we are a long way from radically altering the human body in the sorts of ways they evangelise"".  ""What we see today are the first steps by a brave group of pioneers. Today's reality is a lot more experimental (and painful) than is often communicated to the public.  ""There is a lot that can be learned from the outcome of their self-experimentation. Some have even argued that biohackers might increasingly be responsible in helping the advancement of wearables and wellness technologies."" There are biohackers working with far less extreme - though still very experimental - methods.  Corina Ingram-Noehr, 33, an American events organiser living in Berlin, has a daily ritual involving technology, diet and more than 20 different vitamin supplements to try to keep in peak physical condition. Next to a cupboard that resembles a chemist's shop, she also has a Power Plate, which vibrates from 30 to 50 times a second to make her exercise more effective. And while vibrating, she uses an infrared light in an attempt to build collagen in her skin.          Corina can also be found walking the freezing cold streets of Berlin with bare legs. She calls this her cheap biohack version of cryotherapy - or cold therapy - and admits the ""cops on her street"" think it is hilarious.  She discovered biohacking when recovering from a serious concussion that left struggling to speak. Her boss recommended trying medium chain triglycerides (MCT) oil, which helped her ""head turn on"" and acted as something of a gateway drug for biohacking. ""It opened the floodgates and I was like, 'If this works, this one little thing works so well - like, what else can I do?' ""Biohacking for me is taking control of your own biology. It's taking shortcuts to get to a place that you want to be - so shortcutting your health. That's kind of how I think of it at least.""

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-46426300,"There's nothing about sex and relationships that author and YouTuber Hannah Witton will shy away from talking about - including little-discussed topics such as disability and sex. She's frank, informed, funny and focused on breaking down taboos.  Then there's the Little Mix video. Recently, the 26-year-old - who earlier this year underwent emergency surgery to have her colon removed and a stoma created - featured in the band's music video for the song Strip.  The stoma - an opening in the tummy - means Hannah lives with an ileostomy bag she calls Mona. She has blogged about her journey to ""love her new body"", including publishing a mini-documentary about an underwear photo-shoot in which her stoma and her scars are on display.  Here, and for the Ouch podcast, she ""shoots the breeze about pooing into a bag"" with two more experienced stoma users - BBC presenter Sam Cleasby, who runs the So Bad Ass website, and Blake Beckford who is ""most well known for having a stoma and a sixpack"".  Thousands of people in the UK are living with a stoma bag, having undergone surgery for a number of conditions, including bowel cancer, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  Here's everything you didn't know you wanted to know about living with an ileostomy bag - warning, topics include phantom rectums, Barbie butts and sex.  What on earth's an ileostomy bag?  An ileostomy is an operation involving the small intestine being diverted through an opening - or stoma - in the abdomen. A bag is then placed over the stoma to collect liquid and waste, which is emptied into the toilet. According to Hannah, the stoma looks ""red, squishy and moist. It has no nerve endings, you can't really feel it if you touch it, and poo comes out of it."" All three had theirs fitted due to ulcerative colitis  - where the colon and rectum become inflamed and ulcers develop on the colon's lining. ""I often forget that I have one until I go to the toilet,"" says Hannah. ""The only time I feel it, is if there is any kind of gas. Then the bags get a little bit crunchy, or if my output is kind of liquidy, then it gets a bit sloshy.""  Is it high maintenance? ""At first it's all consuming,"" says Sam. ""You have to learn this whole process of how you look after it, how you change it, how you empty it. Now it is totally just part of my daily routine - I have a shower, change my bag.""  All three say they also have to get up in the middle of the night to empty their bags to prevent leakage. Can you eat normally? ""My family is Indian,"" says Sam. ""When I was in hospital a nurse told me: 'You'll never be able to eat curry again.' I was ready to rip out the drips in my arms. She was wrong. You have to just try different foods and now there's pretty much nothing that I wouldn't eat.""  She says, though, that the first time she ate beetroot, after the surgery, she was horrified: ""I thought I was haemorrhaging from the inside out."" Having a stoma means food isn't digested as well as someone with a fully-functioning system.  Hannah finds it ""fascinating and disgusting"" to watch food emerge and likes to ""pull out long bits of mushroom"". Sam, meanwhile, looks out for whole peas in her bag, and pops them while they're in the pouch.  Is it smelly? Hannah says the output - or poo - smells once it's out of the bag, for example while it's being emptied. In the bag, however, she says you won't smell a thing.   ""If you smell a fart, it is 100% not me because there are filters. So whoever's got a functioning butthole, it was them."" One thing that does smell a bit fishy when it comes out of the bag is, well, fish. But Sam has a top tip - add a drop of minty mouthwash to the pouch which neutralises the fish so you won't smell a thing. Hannah likes to talk about sex, so, does that mean you can still do it if you've had your plumbing re-routed? ""Hell yeah,"" says Sam. ""You can't take your bag off during sex - you'd let all your output out,"" adds Hannah. ""For me it was more the mental barriers like body confidence, feeling insecure and overcoming those. From a physical sense it doesn't really affect anything other than a bag flapping around."" But it's not so straightforward for everyone. ""I've got a gay male friend who has a stoma and has the Barbie butt - when you have your rectum and anus removed and they sew everything up, down below. That changed his sex life,"" says Sam. Hannah still has a rectum, but says she doesn't think there's enough information out there. ""I've no idea how long it is, how fragile it is. Because anal play is not just a gay thing, it's for everyone, so I don't know what I can do with my butt."" While we're there, what's a phantom rectum? ""People who have lost a limb, still feel pain or itching or they feel like their limb's still there,"" says Sam. ""So that's the same but in your rectum. It's like your brain doesn't know that it's not attached anymore."" Hannah adds: ""At the beginning I got it all the time. I was talking to my nurse about these urges that I need to poo. She said: 'Next time just go sit on the toilet and feel it out.'"" Sounds peculiar, what's the cringiest moment you've had? For Sam, it was earlier this year in San Francisco. She felt the skin around her stoma start to burn - a sure sign that it's leaking. She found a supermarket with toilets and dashed inside. ""There was a massive queue and by the time I got there it was everywhere - from my boobs to my knees,"" she says. ""I ended up having to throw away my leggings and T-shirt and had to come out of the toilet in just a bra and dungaree dress crying and walk slowly past this queue of people.  ""There are times where it just feels quite devastating to have an accident in public, but I can laugh about it now."" Hannah says she has a Can't Wait Card from Crohn's and Colitis UK which she can flash in cafes or shops so she can use their facilities without having to give a long explanation.  Are stomas always so troublesome?  ""It's given me my life back,"" says Blake, ""because living with ulcerative colitis was just dreadful. You feel a lot of pain and sickness. I'd get to a point where I wouldn't leave the house for the sake of having an accident.""  For Hannah, it wasn't so liberating.  She was diagnosed at the age of seven and had a lot of difficulty with inflammation. But between the ages of 15 and 25 she went into remission. This changed last year.  ""This flare up just came out of the blue and completely wiped me out. I was in hospital for a month and had to have emergency surgery.  ""I don't feel like getting a stoma gave me my life back. I want to go back to my life before all of this. But having said that, I'm not ashamed of it."" Crohn's and Colitis Awareness  Week runs until 7 December.

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46466888,"Thirty-two surrogate mothers charged with human trafficking in Cambodia for carrying babies for Chinese clients have been released after agreeing to keep the children, officials say.  The women were arrested in June in a raid as part of a crackdown on the country's commercial surrogacy trade. Surrogacy was banned in Cambodia in 2016, a year after neighbouring Thailand imposed limits on the service. Demand has risen in recent years since China's easing of its one-child policy. A further five people, including a Chinese national, have been arrested and charged with human trafficking in connection with the case. The release of the Cambodian surrogate mothers this week was agreed on ""humanitarian grounds"", a police official working with the National Committee for Counter Trafficking (NCCT) said. The official, who asked not to be named, said that while the women had committed a crime, their babies were innocent, and for that reason the NCCT had requested their freedom on condition. ""They have agreed not to sell the babies and will raise them,"" he confirmed, stating that if the women break the agreement they could face human trafficking charges, which could result in up to 15 years in prison, AFP news agency reports. In contrast, acting as an intermediary between an adoptive parent and a pregnant woman is punishable by up to six months in prison. The women were released from a police hospital. It is not clear if they are genetically related to the babies they carry or whether they had agreed to act as gestational surrogates only (by carrying another couple's fertilised embryo).  Cambodia's Secretary of State for the Interior Ministry, Chou Bun Eng, told the BBC in a recent interview that the government rejects the idea that any embryo carried by a mother is not ""her own"".  ""The woman takes care of them and feeds them for more than nine months before the embryo becomes human, so how can you give the children to someone else?"" she said.  She added that surrogacy is now seen as a form of human trafficking in Cambodia because the children, who she said were the victims, are sold as ""goods"". Commercial surrogacy has grown in South East Asia in recent years, prompting some countries to take action. In 2014, a surrogate baby scandal erupted in Thailand after a boy with Down's syndrome - known as Baby Gammy - was abandoned by the Australian couple who had commissioned a Thai surrogate mother to carry him. The following year, Thailand imposed a ban on foreigners seeking Thai surrogate mothers following a string of scandals in the industry. This led to an increase in commercial surrogacy in neighbouring countries such as Cambodia, which then moved swiftly to impose a total ban. But the practice has continued to flourish in other places where it is not regulated, such as Laos. Last year, Australian nurse Tammy Davis-Charles was jailed for 18 months in Cambodia for providing commercial surrogacy services. Besides commercial surrogacy, Cambodia has also banned organ trafficking and the export of breast milk. Other countries that have imposed a ban on commercial surrogacy include India, New Zealand, Canada, Denmark and the UK.",,,,

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46258339,"An accident in a swimming pool left Chieko Asakawa blind at the age of 14. For the past three decades she's worked to create technology - now with a big focus on artificial intelligence (AI) - to transform life for the visually impaired. ""When I started out there was no assistive technology,"" Japanese-born Dr Asakawa says. ""I couldn't read any information by myself. I couldn't go anywhere by myself.""  Those ""painful experiences"" set her on a path of learning that began with a computer science course for blind people, and a job at IBM soon followed. She started her pioneering work on accessibility at the firm, while also earning her doctorate.  Dr Asakawa is behind early digital Braille innovations and created the world's first practical web-to-speech browser. Those browsers are commonplace these days, but 20 years ago, she gave blind internet users in Japan access to more information than they'd ever had before.  Now she and other technologists are looking to use AI to create tools for visually impaired people.  For example, Dr Asakawa has developed NavCog, a voice-controlled smartphone app that helps blind people navigate complicated indoor locations.  Low-energy Bluetooth beacons are installed roughly every 10m (33ft) to create an indoor map. Sampling data is collected from those beacons to build ""fingerprints"" of a specific location.  ""We detect user position by comparing the users' current fingerprint to the server's fingerprint model,"" she says.  Collecting large amounts of data creates a more detailed map than is available in an application like Google Maps, which doesn't work for indoor locations and cannot provide the level of detail blind and visually impaired people need, she says. ""It can be very helpful, but it cannot navigate us exactly,"" says Dr Asakawa, who's now an IBM Fellow, a prestigious group that has produced five Nobel prize winners. NavCog is currently in a pilot stage, available in several sites in the US and one in Tokyo, and IBM says it is close to making the app available to the public. Pittsburgh residents Christine Hunsinger, 70, and her husband Douglas Hunsinger, 65, both blind, trialled NavCog at a hotel in their city during a conference for blind people.  ""I felt more like I was in control of my own situation,"" says Mrs Hunsinger, now retired after 40 years as a government bureaucrat.  She uses other apps to help her get around, and says while she needed to use her white cane alongside NavCog, it did give her more freedom to move around in unfamiliar areas.  Mr Hunsinger agrees, saying the app ""took all the guesswork out"" of finding places indoors.  ""It was really liberating to travel independently on my own.""  Dr Asakawa's next big challenge is the ""AI suitcase"" - a lightweight navigational robot.  It steers a blind person through the complex terrain of an airport, providing directions as well as useful information on flight delays and gate changes, for example.  The suitcase has a motor embedded so it can move autonomously, an image-recognition camera to detect surroundings, and Lidar - Light Detection And Ranging - for measuring distances to objects.  When stairs need to be climbed, the suitcase tells the user to pick it up.   ""If we work together with the robot it could be lighter, smaller and lower cost,"" Dr Asakawa says. The current prototype is ""pretty heavy"", she admits. IBM is pushing to make the next version lighter and hopes it will ultimately be able to contain at least a laptop computer. It aims to pilot the project in Tokyo in 2020.  ""I want to really enjoy travelling alone. That's why I want to focus on the AI suitcase even if it is going to take a long time."" IBM showed me a video of the prototype, but as it's not ready for release yet the firm was reluctant to release images at this stage. Despite its ambitions, IBM lags behind Microsoft and Google in what it currently offers the visually impaired.  Microsoft has committed $115m (¬£90m) to its AI for Good programme and $25m to its AI for accessibility initiative. For example, Seeing AI - a talking camera app - is a central part of its accessibility work.  And later this year Google reportedly plans to launch its Lookout app, initially for the Pixel, that will narrate and guide visually impaired people around specific objects.  ""People with disabilities have been overlooked when it comes to technology development as a whole,"" says Nick McQuire, head of enterprise and AI research at CCS Insight. But he says that's been changing in the past year, as big tech firms push hard to invest in AI applications that ""improve social wellbeing"". He expects more to come in this space, including from Amazon, which has sizeable investments in AI.  More Technology of Business ""But it's really Microsoft and Google... in the last 12 months that have made the big focus in this area,"" he says.  Mr McQuire says the focus on social good and disability is linked to ""trying to showcase the benefits [of AI] in light of a lot of negative sentiment"" around AI replacing human jobs and even taking over completely. But AI in the disability space is far from perfect. A lot of the investment right now is about ""proving the accuracy and speed of the applications"" around vision, he says.  Dr Asakawa concludes simply:  ""I've been tackling the difficulties I found when I became blind. I hope these difficulties can be solved.""",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46480257,"A two-year-old US girl who needs several blood transfusions to fight cancer has spurred a global campaign to search for compatible donors. Zainab Mughal has one of the rarest blood types in the world, which makes it difficult to treat her condition. Campaigners say more than 1,000 people have been tested, but only three so far have the blood she needs. Doctors say seven to 10 donors will be needed over the course of her cancer treatment. Earlier this year Zainab was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, an aggressive and rare form of cancer that mostly affects babies and young children.  Blood transfusions will be needed for the duration of her treatment, but Zainab's blood is ""extremely rare"" because it is missing an antigen - ""Indian B"" - that most people carry in their red blood cells, says OneBlood, a non-profit blood centre that's spearheading the search for donors. The only donors likely to be a match are people of exclusively Pakistani, Indian or Iranian descent with blood type O or A, OneBlood says. But even within these populations, fewer than 4% of people will be missing the Indian B antigen. Zainab's body will reject any blood which doesn't match all the requirements. Two matching donors have been found in the US, and another in the UK. ""This is so rare that honestly this the first time I've seen it in the 20 years I've been doing this,"" said Frieda Bright, a laboratory manager with OneBlood. OneBlood is working with other blood banks and the American Rare Donor Program (ARDP), a program that finds donors of rare types of blood around the world. ""Blood is not going to cure her, but it's very important for her to survive cancer treatment,"" Ms Bright said in a campaign video. Zainab's father Raheel Mughal said his daughter was diagnosed in September. ""We were all crying, this was the worst thing we were expecting,"" he said in the OneBlood video. After he and Zainab's mother offered to donate their own blood, doctors discovered neither of them was compatible. ""And then a lot of people from my family, they went around and donated blood and that's when it became more of an alert."" According to OneBlood, treatment with chemotherapy is already reducing the size of the Zainab's tumour, but she will eventually need two bone marrow transplants. ""My daughter's life very much depends on the blood,"" says Mr Mughal.  ""What [donors] are doing to save my daughter's life is amazing. The work you are doing, I will never ever forget it.""",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46472308,"The number of children being treated for addiction to tranquilisers has doubled in a year, to more than 300, according to Public Health England. The drug Xanax, and copies of it, accounted for the sharpest rise - from eight children receiving treatment in 2016-17 to 53 in 2017-18. Ambulance services around the country have also reported a growing problem.  In 2017-18, more than 15,500 children had help for substance misuse, 88% for cannabis. The total number receiving treatment was 5% down on the previous year,  Xanax is the brand name for the drug alprazolam, a benzodiazepine prescribed for anxiety or panic attacks. But many of the pills taken by children are copies bought online, with no indication of their strength or whether they have been adulterated.  UK Addiction Treatment group psychiatrist Dr Durrani says: ""Benzos work by literally slowing down the functions of the brain, acting as a leveller in times of high stress, over-excitement or anxiety.  ""Serious side-effects can occur, including slurring words or even total blackouts.  ""We're seeing more and more people admitting themselves after becoming addicted to benzos.  ""In most cases, their misuse stemmed from using the drug recreationally at parties and mixing it with alcohol, which proves a toxic combination."" The North East Ambulance Service, which provided the most comprehensive details to a BBC Freedom of Information request sent to six ambulance services, said that in 2017 it had attended 240 callouts for Xanax abuse by children, two of which had been for 11-year-olds. Drugs, alcohol and tobacco director Rosanna O'Connor says: ""Despite fewer under-18s asking for help with drug and alcohol problems, it remains a significant issue and the latest data shows an increasing number of young people needing treatment for benzodiazepines.  ""However, there is limited evidence and data for these drugs, so we do not have a clear picture of changes in use. ""Benzodiazepines are risky when taken without medical supervision and mixing them with alcohol or other drugs increases the risk of harm, particularly when mixed with other sedatives."" The PHE report also says:",,,,

The ""worst case scenario"" warning comes after analysis of likely traffic flows, if customs checks are delayed.  Lorries carrying medicine could get priority at ports and planes used to fly in drugs, ministers said. But Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said it was ""Project Fear on steroids,"" ahead of Tuesday's big Brexit vote. He told the BBC: ""It's the last throw of the dice from the prime minister who is desperate to get MPs to vote for her withdrawal agreement."" The prime minister's claim that the alternative to the withdrawal agreement she has negotiated with the EU is a no-deal Brexit, has so far failed to convince many of her own MPs. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was among ministers trying to promote the deal on Friday, ahead of Tuesday's Commons vote, which the PM is widely expected to lose.  He told the BBC: ""I don't know how likely 'no deal' is. It is what happens automatically unless Parliament passes something else. ""I very strongly feel that the best thing for the country, not just for the health service but for the country as a whole, is for Theresa May's deal to pass."" Updated advice to government departments from officials warns there could be six months of reduced access and delays at Dover and Folkestone, if the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 without a deal. By BBC Health Editor Hugh Pym Drug companies were told in August by the government to create stockpiles in the UK with six weeks worth of supplies.  That has largely been achieved although there has not been so much progress with medical devices. But pharma bosses believe the government should do more to ensure continuity of supply and ministers should give more detail of plans to fast-track lorries through ports. Some may be suspicious about the timing of this with political debate over Brexit raging - government sources say the warning is based on analysis of trading patterns by officials which could not be withheld from Whitehall departments. Mr Hancock has written to health leaders, telling them to check their plans for ensuring the continued supply of medicines. Current advice is that there should be a six-week stockpile of medicines in the UK to cover the possibility of disruption after a no-deal Brexit. About 90% of medicines imported by the UK and the Republic of Ireland come in through Dover. The health secretary said the ""worst-case planning assumption"" meant that ""whilst the six-week stockpiling activities remain a critical part of our contingency plans, this now needs to be supplemented with additional actions"". He said the NHS should prepare to use alternative routes in the event of disruption on cross-channel routes, including the use of planes to fly in supplies.  He wrote that if France or other EU countries imposed additional border checks in a no-deal scenario, the impact was ""likely to be felt mostly on the short straits crossings into Dover and Folkestone"" affecting both exports and imports, with ""significantly reduced access"" for up to six months. ""This is very much a worst-case scenario. In a 'no deal' exit from the EU we would, of course, be pressing member states hard to introduce pragmatic arrangements to ensure the continued full flow of goods which would be to their benefit as well as ours."" Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said the government warning was ""stark"" adding that ""stockpiling more medicines is not the solution to this problem"". He welcomed the intention to prioritise the flow of medicines and vaccines, but added, with just four months to go, ""we need the government to take immediate action to open up alternative supply routes between the UK and Europe and tell companies so that they can make plans"". Kent County Council has warned that dead bodies may remain uncollected and children might miss exams due to gridlocked roads in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In an update on its contingency planning, the local authority said refuse could blight the streets and food deliveries could be disrupted as the county copes with 10,000 lorries parked or stacked on its roads. Council leader Paul Carter said preparations had been made for potential difficulties but added: ""We now need far more input and information from national government in how they are going to work with us. ""There must be a national freight transport plan which, when necessary, can hold lorries back from coming into Kent in the first place should the need arise."" The withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and EU has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by Parliament if it is to come into force. With many of her own MPs opposing the deal, particularly the controversial issue of the ""backstop"", aimed at preventing the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, Mrs May is expected to lose Tuesday's vote on the deal.  One senior minister has told the BBC ""the only political common sense is to delay"" it - but Downing Street has said it will go ahead as planned.",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46454494,"Looking back at photographs of last year's Christmas party, mum-of-twins Meena Kumari-Sharma says she looked ""the picture of health"". She was a successful recruitment consultant and loved long weekends of trips to the zoo and cocktails with friends. But a few months later, she was diagnosed with leukaemia, and now urgently needs to find a stem cell donor. Donor matches are never easy to find, and it's even harder if you're Asian. So rather than sit back and wait, Meena began her own search. ""I just wanted to feel that if my children ask in the future, they can say, 'Mummy did everything that she could've done. She really tried everything,'"" she says. When Meena was diagnosed, she was happy in her home in St Albans, Hertfordshire. But she had to move to Leicester for treatment and leave her two five-year-olds behind with their dad. She video calls them as much as possible. ""Not even a year ago, everything was turned upside down,"" she says. ""In all honesty, I didn't even know that adults got leukaemia. I'm the first person in my entire family to have got cancer.""  Faced with an uncertain future, Meena decided to devote her time to persuading as many people as possible to sign up to the stem cell register. Supported by blood cancer charity DKMS, she began touring the country, urging people to join up. A good match is most likely to be found in people with similar heritages, so Meena is focusing on Indian donors. With her family in tow, she has set up donor drives in shopping centres, mosques, and temples. ""Last month I had to speak to 1,600 people at a classical concert. People were just crying in the audience,"" she says. ""I think when they listen to somebody's story that is an actual patient, that is going through the process, that is a mother, that has twins, that is only 41 - that is an actual shock to the system."" In nine weeks, she has signed 1,500 people up to the register as potential donors. Earlier this week doctors told Meena she had two months left to find a match. To find a suitable donor, doctors have to find someone who matches the patient's tissue type. In a third of cases a match can be found within the family. In Meena's case, her brother was only a 50% match - so only a last resort. But two-thirds have to rely on donors on national and international stem cell registers. And if you're black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME), that's a bigger problem. It's not that people from ethnic minorities aren't signing up, says Sarah Rodgers from blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, as the 1.4 million people signed up as stem cell donors in the UK do broadly reflect the country's ethnic makeup. But it does mean there are far fewer BAME people on the potential donor list. And on top of that, anyone who's not from a white northern European background is more likely to have an unusual tissue type. According to Anthony Nolan, 69% of white northern European patients can find the best possible match from a stranger. But this falls to 20% for patients from BAME backgrounds. ""The problem is that we need a disproportionately higher representation to give those people the same amount of chance as white people,"" Ms Rodgers says. And the biggest registers in the world tend to be in predominantly white countries, she says, leaving a smaller pool of BAME people to match from. You can sign up to the register through Anthony Nolan and DKMS. Fill in your details. Then you'll be posted a kit to take a quick swab of the inside of your cheeks. Swab your cheeks, post it back, and you're done. Stem cell donation is different from blood donation and each have separate registers, so don't assume that if you're on one, you're on the other. If you're matched with someone, your cells can be transferred through bone marrow transplants or blood transfusions, depending on the patient. Before Meena started her campaign, she would tell people ""just pray for me, send positive vibes"". ""And now I'm like, well actually, you can organise an event, you can spread the word, you can sign up."" Despite the stacked odds, Meena has found solace in her Match4Meena campaign. ""It's been really powerful to just get up, be brave, and speak to people."" ""Before the campaign started, I was really feeling in despair about what the future holds,"" she says. ""Even still today I don't know what's going to happen in six months' time. I don't know if I'm going to be here or not. ""Obviously that's hugely worrying, but the campaign has allowed me to let go of that negativity and let go of that unknown because this is something tangible that I can do."" Come February, she will have to assess her options. ""When I look back to when I was diagnosed, sitting in front of a consultant, that was horrendous. It was so dramatic. ""I don't know what will happen to me, but I might be able to save someone else's life and that is reward enough.""",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46469538,"Anna Boniface seemed to have the world at her feet when finishing as the 2017 London Marathon's fastest amateur female runner. Her performance earned her an England team place in that autumn's Toronto Marathon. The then 25-year-old finished the London race in two hours, 37 minutes and travelled to Canada six months later. But 10 miles into her international debut, Anna's ankle fractured.  ""It was the breakthrough that broke me,"" she tells BBC 5 live Investigates.  ""It was horrible, I'd never not finished a race in my life. I thought I could just struggle to the end somehow, but I realised I would not be able to go on, I just had to sit on the kerb and wait."" But worse was to come for the Reading runner. In addition to the stress fracture of her ankle, tests found poor bone density, including osteoporosis in her spine, which made fractures a real risk.   These symptoms were all hallmarks of a condition called Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (Red-S). This occurs when sports people restrict their diet in the belief that constant weight loss will keep improving performance, to such an extent that some of the body's functions begin to shut down.  The condition can cause a range of health problems in men and women including a drop in hormone levels, a deterioration in bone density, a drop in metabolic rate and mental health problems. Anna, who works as a physiotherapist, admits she was aware of the condition but was so desperate to keep improving that she ignored the warning signs, which included not having a period for eight years.  ""It was a lot to do with my training volume and not eating enough - not being wide enough in my food groups, being restrictive with carbohydrates,"" she says.   ""I was training twice a day, I was running 100-plus miles a week at times, and you burn up a lot of energy with that, and from a runner's perspective you get it into your mind that you need to be this race weight. ""You get caught up in this cycle of running really fast, wanting to lose a little more weight, push that race weight a little bit more, running faster, and then just breaking, which is what happened."" The state of Anna's health was discovered before any more serious damage could be done and, after a year's rest, she has been able to slowly return to running.  Red-S can affect male and female athletes and became a recognised condition in 2014 - replacing another condition called female athlete triad, which recognised the effect of too few calories among sportswomen only.  There have been few studies into the prevalence of the condition but it is understood to be most common in sports such as athletics, cycling and dancing, where being light could make a significant difference to performance.  On Sunday, the #Trainbrave campaign is being launched to raise awareness of the risks of Red-S, particularly among promising amateur sportspeople who may be trying to improve their performance without giving enough thought to their diet.  It was the same drive for performance perfection which led cyclist Sam Woodfield, 28, from Northamptonshire, to lose up to one-third of his body weight in a year, after taking up the sport in 2016. Having previously been a bodybuilder and a natural sportsman, losing some weight helped him to rapidly progress to a competitive level in the sport and he began to take it seriously.  But his drive for better performance spiralled to the point that he was frequently enduring gruelling training rides without eating.  For Sam the equation was simple: ""Lighter meant faster which meant I stood more chance of winning."" For a time it worked but his victories came at a huge cost. By 2017 Sam had so little energy he could barely walk upstairs, he could not sleep and his mental health was suffering.  He accepted he needed help and had a series of tests which revealed the true cost of his pursuit of performance. ""I was told I had very low visceral fat around my body which is essential fat you need to keep you alive,"" he says.  ""I was also told that, as well as having no testosterone, I had the bone density of an 80-year-old in my spine and my hips. It was a very scary point in my life."" Dr Nicky Keay, a sport and dance endocrinologist, says Red-S occurs when the athlete's body does not have enough energy to sustain it and begins to shut down.  She says: ""The body partitions the energy you get from your diet. You need an amount to cover training, then the remaining energy is what you need for day-to-day life.  ""If you're not getting enough spare energy you go into survival mode. Oestrogen levels drop in women and testosterone for men which is key for bone health.  ""It's like when your phone's battery drops to a low level, it switches off lots of non-essential apps, this is what the body is doing."" Five live Investigates asked British Athletics what it was doing to raise awareness of the risks among athletes. In response, it said it works with a number of partner organisations, including the English Institute of Sport, to ensure awareness and treatment of the conditions that are part of the Red-S. 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 9 December at 11:00 GMT - catch up on BBC Sounds.",,,,

In July, the Royal College of Surgeons revealed nearly 9,000 fax machines were in use across the NHS in England. The Department of Health said a change to more modern communication methods was needed to improve patient safety and cyber security. An RCS spokesman said they supported the government's decision. In place of fax machines, the Department of Health said secure email should be used. Richard Kerr, who is the chair of the RCS's commission on the future of surgery, said the continued use of the outdated technology by the NHS was ""absurd"". He added it was ""crucial"" that the health service invested in ""better ways of communicating the vast amount of patient information that is going to be generated"" in the future. The group's report from earlier this year found the use of fax machines was most common at the Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Trust, which still relied on 603 machines. Three-quarters of the trusts in England replied to the survey - 95 in total. Ten trusts said that they did not own any fax machines, but four in ten reported more than 100 in use. Rebecca McIntyre from Manchester, who works as a cognitive behavioural therapist, said fax machines are ""a continued risk to the confidentiality and safeguarding of patients"". ""You would not believe the palaver we have in the work place trying to communicate important documents to services (referrals etc),"" she said.  ""We constantly receive faxes meant for other places in error but this is never reported."" Meanwhile, Taz, from Doncaster, works in a pharmacy and said discharge notes, emergency documents and out-of-hours services ""all are stuck in the dark ages"". ""I hope this is just the start of many changes,"" he said. ""The amount of time wasted and potential errors that exist from not using technology is shocking and often it's the patients that suffer. ""My next hope is that hand written prescriptions are scrapped completely and we use tablets to send them electronically for patients like most GPs have been doing for years."" However, Tim Owen. from Bolton, who works in blood services, asked: ""So what happens when a computer virus attacks a hospital's IT infrastructure, as happened recently?  ""During the WannaCry attack of 2017 our 'out-dated, redundant' piece of equipment ensured that blood products, not routinely held in our on-site blood bank, could be ordered without delay and therefore not compromising patient safety."" One GP in the Midlands said they currently rely on a fax machine for requesting x-rays at local hospitals because of an ongoing IT problem which has not been fixed. Meanwhile, outside of the NHS, Nina Mowbray, from Northampton, works for one of the top 10 accountancy firms where she said they still fax documents to HM Revenue and Customs. ""We could email but we need to have this set up first which means we have to get formal approval from a director/partner which we don't do,"" she said. ""It does seem very outdated."" And Joseph Vincent, from Macclesfield, said he still uses his fax machine to communicate with his brother, who lives in a remote part of Scotland. ""The internet is slow there and sometimes we send funny messages to each other using a fax machine. The sound it makes is really satisfying although it is a bit of a running gag between us.""",,,,

Tom Tyreman, 63, from Stockton, initially recovered after the operation at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital a year ago, but died of cancer in February. There was later found to be a small cancerous tumour in the donor organ that was not picked up by screening.  The hospital said the ""tragic outcome"" could not have been anticipated. NHS Blood and Transplant Service said it does everything it can to make sure all donated organs are suitable, but because of the sudden and speedy nature of organ donation it was not normally possible to screen a donor in advance. Pauline Hunt, 49, from Kilmarnock, has also developed cancer after receiving a kidney from the same donor; a woman who died from a blood clot. Mr Tyreman's sister, Jane Bird, said hospital staff needed to be ""more upfront"" about what could potentially go wrong. ""We were told that he could develop cancer further down the line because his immune system was so suppressed, which we accepted"", she said. ""But we were never told that potentially he could get it from the donated organ. ""I think there need to be more stringent tests. It's just unacceptable in this day and age that more vigorous tests cannot be done."" Mr Tyreman's family spoke out after Mrs Hunt described herself as ""basically under a death sentence"". She said: ""Nobody should be fighting somebody else's cancer."" An NHS Blood and Transplant spokesman said the medical history of potential donors is ""carefully checked"" and if an abnormality is found a biopsy is carried out. But ""in very rare cases it's possible the donor has a small tumour which can't be picked up by the tests performed in the limited time available prior to transplant"". ""This means the transmission of an undiagnosed cancer is a risk, though thankfully it's extremely rare."" The Freeman Hospital said an investigation was under way.",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46507024,"Doing crossword puzzles and Sudoku does not appear to protect against mental decline, according to a new study.  The idea of ""use it or lose it"" when it comes to our brains in later life has previously been widely accepted.   The new Scottish study showed that people who regularly do intellectual activities throughout life have higher mental abilities. This provides a ""higher cognitive point"" from which to decline, say the researchers. But the study did not show that they decline any slower. The work, published in the BMJ, was undertaken by Dr Roger Staff at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the University of Aberdeen.  It looked at 498 people born in 1936 who had taken part in a group intelligence test at the age of 11.  This current study started when they were about 64 years old and they were recalled for memory and mental-processing-speed testing up to five times over a 15-year period. It found engagement in problem solving did not protect an individual from decline.  However, engaging in intellectually stimulating activities on a regular basis was linked to level of mental ability in old age.  The study uses modelling to look at associations and cannot prove any causal link. Also, many of the participants were unable to complete the whole study - some dropped out, others died. Previously, some studies have found that cognitive training can improve some aspects of memory and thinking, particularly for people who are middle-aged or older. They found so-called brain training may help older people to manage their daily tasks better.  No studies have shown that brain training prevents dementia.  And last year a report from the Global Council on Brain Health recommended that people should take part in stimulating activities such as learning a musical instrument, designing a quilt or gardening rather than brain training to help their brain function in later life. It said the younger a person started these activities, the better their brain function would be as they aged. Dr Staff and colleagues say even though their study did not find puzzles counteracted mental decline, it doesn't mean they are a waste of time. Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the research added to the ""ongoing 'use it or lose it' debate"". But as the research did not consider people with dementia, ""we can't say from these results whether specific brain training activities could impact a person's risk of the condition"". ""In addition to staying mentally active, keeping physically fit, eating a healthy balanced diet, not smoking, drinking within recommended guidelines and keeping weight, cholesterol and blood pressure in check are all good ways to support a healthy brain as we get older."" Dr James Pickett, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Society, said: ""Although playing 'brain games' such as Sudoku may not prevent dementia, is has been shown that regularly challenging yourself mentally seems to build up the brain's ability to cope with disease.""",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46481137,"Regular weigh-ins at home, plus simple weight-loss tips, could prevent people from piling on the pounds at Christmas, according to a new study.   The Universities of Birmingham and Loughborough divided 272 volunteers into two groups. The ""intervention"" group weighed themselves regularly. They were also given information on how much exercise was needed to burn calories in Christmas food. They ended up weighing 1lb (0.49kg) less than the ""comparison"" group. The comparison group didn't track their weight - they were just given a healthy lifestyle leaflet, which did not include dietary advice.  The researchers say the Winter Weight Watch Study, published today in the BMJ, is the first to look at preventing seasonal weight gain.  Lead author Frances Mason, of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Applied Health Research, said avoiding weight gain during the festive period could help in the long-term fight against obesity.  ""People gain a kilo of weight on average annually. Often this weight gain happens at Christmas, and is never fully lost. This could possibly be a factor driving the obesity epidemic.""  The trial was carried out in 2016 and 2017 over a period of six to eight weeks in November and December. Follow-up measurements were then taken in January and February of the following year. The intervention group were asked to record their weight on a record card and given 10 tips for weight management.  They were also given a list of how much physical activity would be needed to burn off the calories found in popular Christmas food and drinks.  That mince pie might not be as appealing when you factor in the 21 minutes of running needed to burn off the 245 calories found in an average pie.   The groups were also given these tips for weight management: Source: International Journal of Obesity Researchers were not able to identify which of the 10 potential interventions led to the weight loss, although 85% of those who did lose weight stood on the scales twice a week.  But they did conclude that the intervention group were more able to retrain their eating and drinking. They were also marginally less likely to drink alcohol.  But isn't Christmas a time when we are supposed to be able to overindulge?  Frances Mason said they had no problem recruiting volunteers, saying: ""This suggests people were willing to exercise just a small amount of restraint, while still enjoying the Christmas period.  ""It's small changes like say instead of consuming five pigs-in-blankets, consume one or two. Or make sure you get out of the house for a walk. Research shows people underestimate calories, and overestimate their calorie expenditure. ""This is why accurate self-monitoring is an effective strategy for weight management.""  This might also explain the explosion in the popularity of mobile fitness and diet tracker apps. The global mobile fitness app market grew from $1.8bn in 2016 to $2.2bn, says research firm Statista. Researchers from global insurer Vitality also recently showed that offering customers an smartwatch, at minimal cost if they stuck to a fitness regime, also resulted in more regular exercise.",,,,

In the run-up to Christmas, Trading Standards officers are stressing such devices are not genuine toys. Since 2012, at least 47 children have suffered permanent eye damage as a result of lasers being shone in their faces. The government has promised to do more to stop such devices being imported. At the moment it is illegal in the UK to sell lasers that produce more than 1 milliWatt of power.   However, many that are within the legal limit do not conform to EU safety standards, and some are more powerful than their label suggests. ""The biggest problem is that many of these products can be purchased via the internet and are sourced from businesses outside the EU,"" said Robert Chantry-Price, of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. ""As a consequence, they may not have been tested for their safety."" Trading Standards said children were at greater risk of injuries than adults, as they tend not to blink or turn their eyes away if a laser is shone into their face. Those who already own a laser are being told that throwing them away is the ""safest thing to do"". Following an enquiry last year, the government has promised more support to stop high-powered lasers being imported. It wants better labelling, and more public awareness of the dangers. As a result Trading Standards has launched a new video and poster campaign to try and cut down on the number of injuries to children. The law regarding those who use lasers to try and distract pilots, air traffic controllers or motorists was tightened earlier this year. The Laser Misuse (Vehicles) Act provides for prison sentences of up to five years, and unlimited fines.",,,,

The report says the picture is complex, with other pre-existing vulnerabilities like low self-esteem or an unsupportive home also playing a part. But it says schemes to stop adolescents becoming victims may lower the risks. Suicide and self-harm are major causes of death among young people worldwide. Figures from the World Health Organization published last year show that globally: The researchers examined material gathered from a long-term study of 2,232 twins born in England and Wales in 1994-95. They looked at a wide range of adolescent victimisation - maltreatment, neglect, sexual victimisation, family violence, peer/sibling violence, cyber-victimisation, and crime - through interviews with participants when they were 18 years old.  The study found that more than one-third of adolescents had experienced at least one type of severe victimisation between the ages of 12 and 18 and 7% had experienced three or more severe types of victimisation.  Almost a fifth (18.9%) had had some form of self-injurious thoughts and behaviours. The researchers found that teenagers who were victims were much more likely than their non-victimised peers to have these sorts of thoughts. For each additional victimisation type experienced, the risk of contemplating suicide and of self-harming doubled, and the risk of attempting suicide tripled, they found.  Half of adolescents exposed to three or more types of victimisation had experienced suicidal thoughts and self-harm, and a quarter had attempted suicide. The study acknowledges that ""pre-existing vulnerabilities"" are a major factor in these thoughts and behaviours. But, after making adjustments for family and individual vulnerabilities, victimised teens still showed an increase in suicidal thoughts (though not suicide attempts) and self-harming. The study says preventing adolescents from becoming victims - for example through school-based anti-bullying schemes, family support programmes and community safety initiatives - could help reduce the likelihood of them having suicidal thoughts or self-harming. But it also concludes that effective interventions to prevent premature death in victimised adolescents should also address pre-existing vulnerabilities. Lead author Jessie Baldwin from King's College London told the BBC: ""Our findings showed that victimisation in adolescence is an important risk factor for suicidal ideation, self-harm and suicide attempts.  ""Therefore, adolescents known to have experienced maltreatment, bullying, cyber-victimisation, and other forms of victimisation should be supported to prevent them from self-harming or taking their own lives. ""Because victimised adolescents' elevated risk of self-injurious thoughts and behaviours was in part due to their pre-existing vulnerabilities, clinicians treating victimised adolescents should address these vulnerabilities. ""More broadly, professionals working with young people should appreciate that victimised adolescents have a range of vulnerabilities to poor mental health and self-harm."" The research paper - Adolescent victimisation and self-injury - is published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46538926,"People who join the NHS's UK organ donation register are to be asked if they want their religious beliefs to be considered in the donation process. The question aims to reassure people that donation can take place in line with their faith or beliefs. It is hoped the measure can help to boost the low proportion of donors from black and Asian backgrounds. Research has found religious and cultural beliefs are the main barrier to organ donation in these communities. Last year, 42% of black and Asian families agreed to donate their relative's organs, compared with 66% of families from the overall population.  More than a third of patients waiting for a kidney transplant are from black, Asian and other minority ethnic communities and often their best chance of a match will come from someone of the same ethnic background.  A part of the shortage of donors is caused by people from these backgrounds choosing not to donate. But even if a person does choose to donate by signing up to the register, families have the final say on whether their organs should be used.  Bimla Parmar, a Sikh who lived in Hayes, west London, became a lifesaving organ donor when she died of a brain haemorrhage, aged 68, after collapsing at home.  Her daughter, Gurpreet Parmar, 39, said: ""My mum was not on the NHS organ donation register but my siblings and I were fine with it as we believed someone else should be helped by our loss.  ""I personally had registered to be a donor a long time ago as I want to help someone else once I am gone.  ""Mum was religious and loved by everyone. She was able to donate her lungs, kidneys and liver to four people.  ""I hope more of my generation and younger people educate the elders to sign up to donate and explain what their gift can mean to a family seeing their loved one struggle on a daily basis."" People signing up to the register will now be asked whether or not they want their faith or beliefs to be discussed with their family or anyone else they consider appropriate, such as a faith leader.  NHS Blood and Transplant, the organisation that runs the NHS organ donation register, said this would enable nurses to discuss concerns about the process with families, such as whether a burial would be delayed. Jackie Doyle-Price, Minister for Inequalities, said: ""Organ donation is a priceless gift but thousands of people are still waiting for a transplant and we must do all we can to remove the barriers that prevent people from signing up as a donor.   ""This important update will give people the confidence that when they register a decision to donate their organs, their beliefs will always be considered."" The new question will be added to the register on Thursday. BBC News is exploring the experience of families of deceased organ donors. Have you ever been asked to make the decision about organ donation on behalf of a family member in hospital and felt unable to agree to donate? Maybe because you did not know their wishes, maybe the organ retrieval operation took too long.

Health experts say meals should not exceed 600 calories, but in this study they averaged 1,033 in restaurants and 751 in fast-food chains. University of Liverpool researchers analysed thousands of meals from places like Hungry Horse and McDonald's. They said their findings were a cause for concern. The research team looked at more than 13,500 meals on the menus of 21 sit-down restaurants and six fast-food chains. By using online company information on calorie content, only one in 10 meals was classed as healthy or fewer than 600kcal, as recommended by Public Health England. And nearly half of the meals contained 1,000kcal or more. Sit-down restaurants were five times more likely to offer high-calorie meals of 1,000kcal or more than fast-food restaurants, the research found. Dr Eric Robinson, lead researcher from Liverpool's department of psychological science, said the results were ""shocking"" but probably underestimated the calories consumed in restaurants. ""We don't know about energy intake but 'plate clearing' is a common behaviour.  ""Our analysis did not include drinks, starters, desserts or side orders."" Hungry Horse restaurants had the highest average meal calorie content of 1,358kcal. Chains including Flaming Grill, Stone House and Sizzling Pubs were not far behind, with an average of 1,200kcal per meal. KFC topped the fast-food list with an average of 987 calories per meal offered. Burger King, McDonald's and Subway were around 700kcal. Even when the study compared similar meals, the energy content in restaurant meals was greater. Burger meals in restaurants contained an average of 414kcal more than burger meals in fast-food chains, while salad meals in restaurants were slightly higher in calories on average than fast food salads. Dr Robinson said portion size, the ingredients used and cooking methods could explain the difference, but he said the food industry had to make changes. ""It's really clear what the food industry need to do. They need to act more responsibly and reduce the number of calories that they're serving."" Hungry Horse said it offered something for everyone at good value. A spokesperson for the chain said: ""We have been working hard to increase the range of lower calorie options, including recently launching a dedicated Live Well range with dishes under 600 calories, and we are committed to further changes."" The government is currently consulting on a plan to introduce mandatory calorie labelling in restaurants, takeaways and cafes, which is likely to finish in the new year.  Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade association UKHospitality, said restaurants, pubs and other hospitality businesses were already taking action to reduce calories and offer healthier dishes - but there were costs to consider too. ""Proposals to shrink the size of dishes or cap calories would be yet another burden for hard-pressed operators to absorb, resulting in prices going up and investment in businesses going down; inevitably negatively impacting the overall customer experience."" Dr Robinson said research showed that meals eaten out of the home contained more calories and with more people having restaurant food delivered to their homes using online services, the problem could be getting worse.  The study relied on information provided online by restaurant chains on calorie content. Very few provided calorie labelling on their menus. The researchers said it was possible the fast-food sector was now offering more lower-energy meals and healthier options, after pressure from campaigners to do so.",,,,

They've already lost three. Ruba now wants IVF, to select a healthy embryo. Saqib is putting his trust in Allah. And some relatives want them to separate and remarry. Ruba Bibi had not wanted to marry so young. She had planned to do A-levels and go to university, but before she had finished her GCSEs her parents arranged for her to marry Saqib Mehmood, her cousin, in Pakistan.  Born and brought up in Bradford, Ruba had visited Pakistan twice before the wedding - once when she was four and once when she was 12. She couldn't really remember the man she was now engaged to and had never spent time alone with him. He was 27 and worked as a driver. She was 17. ""I was really nervous because I didn't really know him,"" she remembers. ""I was really shy, I couldn't talk much and I hadn't ever had any interest in boys or anything like that. I was scared and asked my parents to delay things to let me finish school, but they couldn't."" After three months in Pakistan she was pregnant. She returned to Bradford two months later, shocked to be having a baby so soon. But also happy. When their son, Hassam, was born in 2007 she excitedly called Saqib to tell him that all was well, although the baby seemed to sleep a lot and had trouble feeding. ""I just thought it was normal,"" Ruba says. Listen to Born in Bradford on Radio 4 at 11:00 on Friday 14 December Click here for earlier Born in Bradford programmes, with Winifred Robinson, dating back to 2012 A few weeks later she went for a check-up, and as the GP watched Hassam moving she noted that his hip seemed stiff. ""She said she was going to refer him, but I thought it was something minor. They did some tests and then I got a call saying I had to come to the children's ward for his results,"" Ruba says. ""When I went in, the doctor told me it was very bad news. She gave me a leaflet and said he has this condition and it's very rare. It was too much for me to take in and I was just crying. I came home and rang my husband in Pakistan, who tried to calm me down. He told me that everyone goes through problems and that we would get through this together."" Ruba had no idea that both she and her cousin carried the recessive gene for I-cell, a rare inherited condition that prevents a child growing and developing properly. Seven months later Saqib received a visa to live in the UK, and was able to hold his son for the first time. ""He said he looked like normal baby. He wasn't sitting or crawling, but my husband said some children were just slow,"" Ruba says. She, however, could see a big difference between her son and other babies the same age. Hassam was growing slowly, and was in and out of hospital with chest infections. And as he got older his head increased in size. When their next child, Alishbah, was born in 2010 tests confirmed immediately that she, too, had I-cell disease. She died at the age of three, towards the end of 2013 - just over a year after her elder brother. Before getting pregnant a third time, Ruba consulted Mufti Zubair Butt, the Muslim chaplain at Leeds Teaching Hospital, to ask what her religion would make of screening during pregnancy - and termination if I-cell was confirmed. He told her that it would be an acceptable course of action, but advised her to think very carefully. ""If you have this condition where the child is going to die in any case, or even if it doesn't die soon, it will have debilitating illness, that's sufficient reason to terminate before the soul enters the body, based on the sayings of the prophet,"" he said. But he also said that she shouldn't do this just because she had a green light to do so, as it was something she would have to live with for the rest of her life. And he advised her to consider the views of those in her community, many of whom were likely to oppose termination. ""To overcome that, on a personal level, that's a great challenge as well,"" he said. Ruba decided she would not want to terminate a pregnancy. So when she got pregnant with her third child, Inara, in 2015, she refused the medical scans she was offered and turned down repeated requests from doctors to be screened. ""I wanted them to treat it like a normal pregnancy. I didn't want them to put the doubt in my head. I wasn't going to have an abortion, so I wanted to enjoy the pregnancy,"" she says. ""I used to say to my husband there could be a chance this baby is ill as well, but he said, 'It's fine.' I think I had a lot of doubt - I knew the odds were the same as for the other two."" But Inara too was born with I-cell disorder.  ""I was really happy that I had a baby, but when we saw her we kind of knew,"" says Ruba. ""I was sad and upset that we went through all the pregnancy and we really wanted a healthy baby. I didn't know how much pain she would go through - but my husband was happy. He said, 'Just be grateful.'"" Inara died almost exactly a year ago, at the age of two. She fell ill with a chest infection last December and her condition deteriorated quickly. She was taken from the Bradford Royal Infirmary to York.  ""The doctors in York were trying to do 100% to keep her alive, I did have that hope but I could see she was in pain. She was sedated until she passed away. I had her in my arms for most of the time, then I lay down beside her. My husband realised she was taking her last breaths."" Ruba says she has no idea how they have all endured the pain of losing three children and of suffering six miscarriages, the last just weeks after Inara's death. ""I didn't even know I was pregnant at that time and I miscarried after the funeral,"" she says. She says it was Inara's death that made her accept a link between her children's misfortunes and cousin marriage. For a long time she just did not believe it, in part because she saw other ill and disabled children at the hospice and it was clear that not all of them were conceived by married cousins. Some were from the white community. ""My husband still doesn't believe it,"" she says. ""I believe it now because it's happened three times, so there must be something in what they're saying. It must be true."" After Inara's death, some of Ruba and Saqib's relatives, both in the UK and in Pakistan, came to the conclusion that they were unlikely to have a healthy child - and argued that the marriage should therefore end in a ""happy separation"". This would allow both partners to remarry and have healthy children with someone else. ""We both said no,"" Ruba says. ""My husband says: 'If God is going to give me kids, then he can give me them from you. He's given me kids from you and he can give me healthy kids from you. If it's written, it's written for you. I'm not going to get married again and neither can you get married again, we are both going to try together.'"" And although Ruba was reluctant to marry in 2007, after 10 years of married life she doesn't want to part. ""Relatives wanted us to be happily separated for the kids, so that I can have healthy kids with someone else and so could he. But what if I do have healthy kids with someone, they might not make me feel like he makes me feel? I might have kids but not a happy marriage. It might not be successful marriage, and I don't want to bring kids up as a single parent. I have heard about people doing this but it's not for us."" But what options does this leave them? One possibility is to have IVF. This would enable doctors to screen embryos, rejecting those with I-cell disease, and selecting a healthy embryo to implant in Ruba's womb.  Saqib is not enthusiastic about this, Ruba says. ""He just says that whatever Allah is going to give us is meant to be - if we're destined to have a child like this then we can have it in any circumstances,"" she says. For her part, Ruba would like to try IVF - but the length of the waiting list is a drawback.  ""I want it to happen quickly. If you wait for something for a long time then it's more tempting to try naturally,"" she says. Her husband has been to appointments with her but it's hard for him to take time off from the bakery where he works and h",,,,

Southwest Airlines says the organ was flown to Seattle from California, where it was to be processed at a hospital to have a valve recovered for future use. But it was never unloaded and its absence was not noticed until the plane was almost half-way to Dallas.  The heart itself had not been intended for a specific patient. Details of the incident, which occurred on Sunday, were revealed in media reports on Thursday. Passengers were said to have been shocked when the captain told them about the cargo and why the flight was turning back. Some used their smartphones to investigate the length of time that a heart can be stored before it is no longer viable for a transplant operation - typically between four and six hours, according to experts.  The plane was reportedly in the air for about three hours. A doctor who was among the passengers but not involved in the shipment of the organ, told the Seattle Times newspaper that the incident was a ""horrific story of gross negligence"". Following the flight's return to Seattle, the heart was taken to a donor health centre for tissue storage and was said to have been received within the required time frame, the newspaper added. In a statement, Southwest Airlines said the heart reached its intended destination ""within the window of time allotted by our cargo customer"". A spokeswoman for Sierra Donor Services, the nonprofit that organised the donation, said that the heart will now be processed so that its valves can be used for life-saving procedures, but added that these ""won't be available for implant for quite some time"". Monica Johnson, Sierra Donor Services' executive director, said the donor's family had been notified of the travel delay. ""They are relieved their loved one's heart valves were received and will be able to help others,"" she said. After the plane returned to Seattle it was taken out of service due to a mechanical issue that Southwest says was unrelated to the heart mishap.",,,,

It follows a review by the medicines regulator that found they were linked with a ""very small"" risk of harm and there is little evidence they work. Parents have been advised to massage the gums or use a teething ring before trying the gels.  The guidance comes from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which said instructions about using the gels and safety warnings for them should also be updated.  It said gels containing lidocaine should only be used as a second line of treatment following discussions with a healthcare professional.

Baby Benedicte's mother was infected with Ebola and died during childbirth. Benedicte showed symptoms only days later and it has taken five weeks of round-the-clock treatment to keep her alive. Her dad and aunt took her home on Wednesday.  ""Her father, Thomas, was very emotional‚Ä¶ she is his first baby,"" a health ministry spokeswoman told the BBC.  Ebola is a deadly infection that causes severe fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, and internal and external bleeding.  About half of those infected die, but babies are even less likely to survive. During this outbreak, there have been 27 cases of Ebola in children yet to reach their first birthday and 21 have died. Tales of survival, like Benedicte's, are rare. She was born on 31 October 2018 and was cared for at the Ebola Treatment Center in Beni, the city hardest hit by the outbreak in DR Congo. She is the youngest patient for whom doctors and volunteers there have cared. The little girl has become known as the ""miracle of Beni"". Ebola basics: What you need to know The Ebola outbreak in the country is now the second largest in history.  The latest figures show there have been 515 cases and 303 deaths. Since October, there have been around 33 people diagnosed every week and children and women have been disproportionately affected. The World Health Organization says the situation in the country is ""concerning"" and there remains a ""very high risk"" of the outbreak spreading further.  It has been able to use new tools that have not been available in previous outbreaks. Nearly 45,000 people have been given an Ebola vaccine and for the first time multiple experimental Ebola drugs are being trialled in the midst of an outbreak.  But efforts to contain the virus have been hampered by conflict in the region with more than one million people displaced from their homes and refugees moving to neighbouring countries. Armed groups have made it challenging for healthcare workers to do the basics of managing an outbreak, including tracing people who may have come into contact with infected individuals.

Twenty states argued the whole law was invalidated by a change in tax rules last year which eliminated a penalty for not having health insurance.  President Donald Trump said the ruling was great news for America.  The law's provisions will, however, remain in place until an appeal is heard at the US Supreme Court.  President Trump promised to dismantle Barack Obama's landmark 2010 healthcare law, which was designed to make medical cover affordable for the many Americans who had been priced out of the market. But despite his Republican Party having majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the ACA is still operating.  However, in 2017 Congress did repeal the requirement - the so-called individual mandate - that people buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Mr Trump took to Twitter following the judge's ruling in Texas. He also urged incoming Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to ""pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare"". The ruling came a day before the deadline for Obamacare enrolment for the coming year.  Two Republicans - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his Wisconsin counterpart Brad Schimel led the legal challenge. Sitting in Fort Worth, US District Judge Reed O'Connor noted that a $1.5tn tax bill passed by Congress in 2017 eliminated the tax penalties which anyone who failed to obtain health insurance had to pay. He ruled that the individual mandate was now unconstitutional.  As the individual mandate was an ""essential"" element of the ACA, the whole of Obamacare was therefore unconstitutional, Judge O'Connor said. He said his ruling was concerned with the intentions of the 2010 and 2017 Congresses. ""The former enacted the ACA. The latter sawed off the last leg it stood on."" Ms Pelosi described the ruling as ""cruel"" and ""absurd"" and said it would be repealed. She said it exposed ""the monstrous endgame of Republicans' all-out assault on people with pre-existing conditions and Americans' access to affordable health care"". Mr Schumer, meanwhile, said the ruling appeared ""to be based on faulty legal reasoning and hopefully it will be overturned"". He said that if it was upheld in the higher courts ""it will be a disaster for tens of millions of American families, especially for people with pre-existing conditions"". The decision is almost certain to be challenged in the US Supreme Court.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said that the law would remain in place for the time being, pending further legal developments. Meanwhile, the White House called on Congress to replace Obamacare with an affordable healthcare system which protects people with pre-existing conditions. But other states have argued that eliminating Obamacare would harm millions of Americans, and pending any appeal the landmark health care law remains in place. US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""If this awful ruling is upheld in the higher courts, it will be a disaster for tens of millions of American families.""",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46565556,"With the festive season upon us, many parents are bound to find themselves drinking more than normal, be it at the pub or at any of the various Christmas parties. For those with young children, this may involve calling on the help of a kindly grandparent or a local babysitter for some childcare.  But how many parents think about how they will look after young children the following day, when the inevitable hangover kicks in? A US report has found that a quarter of parents were not likely to think about whether they'll be able to take care of their child the day after drinking at a special occasion - and don't limit their alcohol intake. The survey of 1,170 parents with children aged 0 to nine also found that one in 12 parents admitted they may have been too impaired to carry out their parenting responsibilities in the past.  Sarah Clark, an associate research scientist at the University of Michigan Medical School, which carried out the research, said: ""A parent passed out on the couch will not be effective in recognising and reacting to the everyday safety risks that occur with children."" One reason some parents fail to plan for the day after a boozy night, is they may not be in the habit of nights out where they drink a lot, says Ms Clark. This lack of drinking ""practice"" means they're likely to have a reduced tolerance for alcohol, a part of which is also caused by getting older, she says. As a result, parents may underestimate how badly they're likely to feel and what a struggle it can be looking after young children when hungover.  ""Some of it is you don't always recognise that you might hit a stage in your life where it affects you differently,"" Ms Clark says. Splitting headaches, sickness and dizziness - we all know the symptoms that can come from having a few too many. Hangovers vary from person to person and there are many factors that affect how bad they are, such as how much we drink. Scientists do not fully understand what causes a hangover, but one of the culprits is thought to be ethanol - a toxic chemical which works in the body as a diuretic, causing you to pee more and become dehydrated. Once you have a hangover, there's no magic cure, although rehydrating, painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen and sugary foods are some of the things that may ease your discomfort.   But there are steps you can take to reduce the chance of getting a hangover in the first place. These include:  Source: NHS website Alcohol can also remain in the system the day after a heavy night of drinking. Generally, the body takes about three hours to break down the alcohol in a glass of wine and two hours for a pint of beer.  It means that, depending on how much you've drunk, you could still be over the legal alcohol limit for driving the day after drinking. In some cases parents should make childcare arrangements for the day after a big night of drinking, says Ms Clark. But all parents should at least think about whether or not they need to make plans, she said. ""Every day if you look at the news you can see situations where nobody meant for harm to occur but it did,"" Ms Clark said.  ""Don't leave it to chance. You don't want to be the family in that news story.""",,,,

The percentage of 12th grade students, typically aged 17-18, who reported vaping nicotine rose to 21% from 11% in 2017, a survey by the University of Michigan said. Researchers say the trend is reversing declines in the number of adolescents who use nicotine. The survey asked students if they had vaped over the preceding 30 days.  The Monitoring the Future study, based on interviews with 45,000 students across the country, said this was the largest single-year increase in its 44-year history, surpassing a surge in marijuana smoking in the 1970s. It also said: ""The policies and procedures in place to prevent youth vaping clearly haven't worked,"" said Richard Miech, the survey's lead author.  ""Vaping is reversing hard-fought declines in the number of adolescents who use nicotine... These results suggest that vaping is leading youth into nicotine use and nicotine addiction, not away from it."" There was no significant change in the use of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and other popular drugs, the report said, while binge drinking saw a sharp decline in 2018 among 12th grade students. The decline in cigarette smoking by teens showed some interruption this year. It is hard to say exactly. Experts blame newer versions of e-cigarettes, some of them looking like USB drivers, that can be used discreetly, and the many flavourings available. Another reason could be that more teenagers are staying at home, communicating on smartphones, and not hanging out with friends. Vaping tends to be an individual activity, experts say, while drinking, smoking and drug experimentation are mostly done in groups. ""Factors that make vaping so attractive to youth include its novelty and the easy concealability of the latest vaping devices, which better allows youth to vape without adults knowing about it,"" Mr Miech added. The appeal of e-cigarettes to teens is widespread and has raised alarm in other countries too, including the UK. Many believe vaping leads to cigarette use and warn of possible long-term health consequences. But there is little consensus about how to regulate the industry. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in September there was an ""epidemic"" of use of flavoured e-cigarettes among teens. Last month, e-cigarette maker JUUL Labs agreed to temporarily halt sales of certain flavours in the US in a bid to curb teenage use. The company also shut down its Instagram and Facebook social media channels.",,,,

The medicines regulator says clear warnings on product packaging is needed to alert consumers.  The MHRA says it has heard of more than 50 such deaths reported by UK fire and rescue services. People should not stop using the creams but be aware of the risk. Washing clothing and bedding can reduce product build-up but not totally remove it. It was previously thought the risk occurred with emollients that contained more than 50% paraffins. But evidence now points to a risk with all emollients, including paraffin-free ones.  Fabric that has been in repeated contact with these products burns more easily, meaning users should not smoke or go near naked flames. Philip Hoe died after accidentally setting himself on fire at Doncaster Royal Infirmary in 2006, when sparks from a cigarette reacted with the emollient cream he was covered in. Within seconds, Mr Hoe, who was receiving treatment for psoriasis, was engulfed in flames and he died shortly after being transferred to another hospital, in Sheffield. June Raine, from the MHRA, said: ""We don't want to unduly worry people into not using these products, which offer relief for what can be chronic skin conditions, but it is equally important people are aware of the risks and take steps to mitigate them. ""If you use emollients and have any questions or concerns, we'd recommend speaking to a healthcare professional, such as your pharmacist or GP."" The MHRA has been working with the Commission on Human Medicines, which has come up with recommendations for manufacturers: John Smith, from the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, said: ""Emollient products are an important and effective treatment for chronic and often severe dry skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis.  ""People should continue to use these products but it is vital they understand the fire risk associated with a build-up of residue on fabric and take steps to mitigate that risk. ""We have been working with MHRA during its review of the evidence to ensure the warning is implemented consistently across industry and to support efforts to raise awareness of this issue.""",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46591640,"Gently stroking a baby reduces activity in their brain associated with painful experiences, a study has found.  The study, by University of Oxford and Liverpool John Moores University, monitored the brain activity of 32 babies while they had blood tests.  Half were stroked with a soft brush beforehand and they showed 40% less pain activity in their brain.  Author Rebeccah Slater said: ""Touch seems to have analgesic potential without the risk of side-effects."" The study found that the optimal pain-reducing stroking speed was about 3cm (1in) per second.  ""Parents intuitively stroke their babies at this optimal velocity,"" said Prof Slater.  ""If we can better understand the neurobiological underpinnings of techniques like infant massage, we can improve the advice we give to parents on how to comfort their babies."" That speed of stroking activates a class of sensory neurons in the skin called C-tactile afferents, which have been previously been shown to reduce pain in adults. But it had been unclear whether babies had the same response or whether it developed over time.   ""There was evidence to suggest that C-tactile afferents can be activated in babies and that slow, gentle touch can evoke changes in brain activity in infants,"" said Prof Slater. Prof Slater said the study, published in Current Biology, could explain anecdotal evidence of the soothing power of touch-based practices such as infant massage and kangaroo care, where premature babies are held against the skin to encourage parent-infant bonding and possibly reduce pain.  ""Previous work has shown that touch may increase parental bonding, decrease stress for both the parents and the baby, and reduce the length of hospital stay,"" said Prof Slater.  The study authors now plan to repeat their experiment in premature babies, whose sensory pathways are still developing. Caroline Lee-Davey, chief executive at the premature and sick baby charity Bliss welcomed the research.  ""We already know that positive touch - such as skin-to-skin care - makes a real difference directly to babies in neonatal care and also helps parents to bond with their baby.  ""This new research suggests that parental touch could also help to alleviate pain in infants and Bliss is delighted to be funding Oxford University to do more research specifically on reducing pain in premature babies through the use of parental touch, from the new year.  ""Many people do not realise just how many medical procedures a baby in neonatal care goes through during their hospital stay.  ""Anything that can reduce a baby's discomfort is a huge step forward in this underfunded area of research.""",,,,

But what her 7,500 Instagram followers don't know is there's a big reason she chooses to wear oversized clothes - which she has kept secret until now. Scroll through my Instagram and it's full of pictures of me in different outfits.   The one thing you'll notice is my style is oversized baggy fits. I've always loved the look - it's something that's quite sporty but also smart. I'm lucky enough to work in fashion - I look after social media for a modelling agency in Manchester. But this industry is all about the way you look and sometimes I feel like I can't always wear what I want.  You'd never catch me wearing something that is tight or figure-hugging. Instead I end up wearing lots of layers because I am hiding something.  I have a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) - which causes tumours to grow along my nerves. When I was born I had a birth mark on my left side and as I grew so did the mark. I feel like I have one normal side of my body but then on the other side, on my hip, there are tumours. Some of them feel heavy and the lump feels like it's heated. Some of the tumours are rock hard but then some are really soft. They're not cancerous but sometimes they cause me pain on my joints and my back and the left side of my body throbs. I wear baggy oversized clothes to hide my tumours - people think that's just my style but that's not entirely true.  Social media is full of pictures of people looking perfect. Do I really want to be the person to highlight that I'm not? The modelling industry is all about looking good and working in this industry you do want to dress well. But it takes me longer to pick out clothes I want to wear because I'm worried my tumours will show. Summer is probably the hardest season for me to shop or dress up in because I usually wear layers. I want to slowly learn to accept my NF and maybe wear fitted clothing and not be ashamed about what I have. When it comes to dating, my tumours have held me back. All my friends are in relationships, I try not to think about it but it would be nice to meet someone some day. I worry though. How do you tell someone you're dating that you have a genetic condition? When is the right time? It's not a small thing, it's a big deal and it's going to be with me for the rest of my life. Apart from my mum and little sister, I don't know anyone else who has NF. For the Newsbeat documentary My Tumour Made Me Trendy, I got to meet Adam Pearson - who also has the condition. He's an actor and presenter and appeared in the 2014 film Under the Skin with Scarlett Johansson. Adam's tumours are mostly on his face, it also affects his vision and he can't see out of his left eye. He told me that he hated school because he was bullied and called names like ""Elephant Man"", ""freak"" and ""Quasimodo"". Meeting him really put things into perspective for me - he can't hide his NF under baggy clothes like I can. He's so inspiring, I mean he's been in a film with Scarlett Johannsson, which is so cool. I was blown away by how confident he was and it really inspired me. I decided that I should embrace my NF and share the fact I had the condition in an Instagram story.  I was absolutely terrified revealing something I'd kept secret for so long. It was a big deal for me because I've never shared my body, let alone my condition, with my followers. But I received so many messages of support and loads of people shared my story. I also had a mum contact me to say their daughter has the same condition and I was an inspiration to them. Afterwards, I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders because it's something I've been so insecure about. Although I've revealed my condition to my followers I don't know if I'm at the stage where I want to constantly show it with fitted clothes.  But I do feel like people understand why I wear baggy clothes now and I feel like much more of a real person online. Arooj was speaking to Newsbeat's Gurvinder Gill.

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46570494,"An overactive immune system may help explain the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome, scientists from King's College London have suggested. Many sufferers of CFS, or ME, say their condition began with a challenge to their immune system like an infection.  The scientists studied 55 patients with Hepatitis C who were given a drug that causes a similar response to a virus.  Eighteen of those patients had an overactive immune system and went on to develop CFS-like symptoms.   Chronic fatigue syndrome is a long-term illness characterised by extreme tiredness.  Scientists from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College recruited 55 patients who had hepatitis C. A treatment for hepatitis C is the drug interferon-alpha which challenges the immune system in the same way as a powerful infection.  The team measured fatigue and immune markers before, during and after treatment, tracking which people developed the persistent CFS-like illness.  In the 18 patients who developed CFS-like symptoms the team found a much stronger immune response to the medication. Significantly these patients also had an overactive immune system before the treatment started. Lead researcher Dr Alice Russell from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) said:  ""For the first time, we have shown that people who are prone to develop a CFS-like illness have an overactive immune system, both before and during a challenge to the immune system.  ""Our findings suggest that people who have an exaggerated immune response to a trigger may be more at risk of developing CFS.""  Senior researcher, Prof Carmine Pariante, added: ""This is a light in the fog, a direction of travel. Although screening is a long way off, our results are the first step in identifying those at risk and catching the illness in its crucial early stages."" What is ME? Myalgic encephalomyelitis or ME is also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) The long-term illness affects about 250,000 people in the UK As well as fatigue, it can cause sleep problems and muscle and joint pain Living with CFS/ME can be difficult. Extreme tiredness and other physical symptoms can make it hard to carry out everyday activities There is currently no cure for ME Source: NHS Choices Dr Charles Shepherd, the ME Association's medical adviser, said: ""This research adds to the growing weight of scientific evidence which indicates that the body's immune system is playing an important role in the causation of ME/CFS."" The study is one of five research projects funded by the Medical Research Council into the causes of ME.  In June, Scottish National Party MP Carol Monaghan led an emotional Westminster Hall debate into a common treatment, graded exercise therapy (Get), which is available on the NHS. She argued it was often damaging and in need of revision. Others have defended the treatment.   The health watchdog, NICE, is currently updating its guidelines for treatment of CFS in England, but publication is not due until 2020.",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-46430700,"A woman has celebrated the first anniversary of having her leg amputated - by running a 5k race. Victoria Snell, 27, from Plymouth, broke her leg while walking with a friend in 2011. Despite repeated surgery, her leg did not heal properly and she decided in December 2017 to ""cut it off to get my life back"". A year on, Victoria said just being able to run a race had left her feeling free ""for the first time in years"". ""It's a year of learning how to walk again, of experiencing 'firsts' for a second time and of trying to push past any limitations I set myself in the past,"" she said. ""Despite the pain, frustration and the bone-deep exhaustion I have experienced since the surgery, I have not regretted it for even a second.  ""I feel free for the first time in years, even if it is endlessly frustrating to realise I need to do something after I've already taken my leg off for the day."" Victoria completed the Queen Elizabeth Christmas Olympic Park 5k run in London on Sunday. ""I came third from last, and I was lapped by almost all the 10k runners, but I did it! My aim was to do it in under an hour and I did it in just under 55 minutes,"" Victoria said. Before her life-changing operation, Victoria - who works for a train company - said she could not remember the last time she took a step that did not hurt. Throughout her 20s, she had been unable to walk to work, despite living just a 15-minute stroll from the office, because the pain was too great. When Victoria raised the idea of amputation with her doctor, he told her to consider her decision for one month before meeting with the amputation team. It was after this - as well as having the support of her parents and younger sister - the decision to carry out the procedure was made. Despite not regretting the amputation, having a prosthetic leg has come with some issues Victoria never thought she would have to deal with. ""I lost my shoe once,"" she said. ""When you wear slip-on shoes, when you walk, you grip slightly but you can't grip with a fake foot.  ""There are ways I keep it on - which vary from shoving a sock at the end of my shoe so my foot is stuck in, to using Blu Tack to keep the shoe attached to my foot. ""I think I was using Blu Tack that day and it didn't work.  ""As I was walking, people were looking at me weirdly. I looked down and I was only wearing one shoe! No idea where it is,"" Victoria added. One year on, Victoria is in a good place and happy with the progress she has made in the past 12 months. But what does she think the future will bring? ""If you're going through something for such a long time like I was, it's really hard to see an end. This decision was so final.  ""This is for the rest of my life. I know that sounds really stupid but it's weird. ""I'd like to think I'll get married, have kids and buy a house, but I don't know that's going to happen. ""But I know no matter what I do, I'm going to be an amputee doing it. That's a strange thing to sometimes think about.""",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46513720,"Breast cancer is a disease that overwhelmingly affects women, but men get it too. Peter Bagnall is one of them. Peter, 56, who is from Birmingham, got in touch with BBC Radio 5 Live during a discussion about women choosing to ""go flat"" instead of having reconstruction after breast cancer. Here, in this own words, is Peter's story of how he struggled following his breast cancer diagnosis, and how he and his partner Lorraine, who also had the condition, coped. ""When I got breast cancer I was sucked into a world of which I wasn't a part.   My partner Lorraine got breast cancer in 2006 so I know a bit about what women go through. She had a lumpectomy, but then they had to take off the whole breast. When I found a lump under my nipple in 2013, I didn't think it was breast cancer.  If it was not for Lorraine, I wouldn't have even gone to the doctors. I felt a bit of a fraud. The doctor immediately sent me to the hospital and after a biopsy it got confirmed as breast cancer. It was a total shock. I didn't know men could get it. Around 390 men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the UK, while 55,000 women are diagnosed with the disease.   As a man I felt like a lone voice. Even going for an MRI scan, all the waiting areas say ""female only"", the model they showed me was a female model, there was nothing for me to feel a part of it.   I felt like a footnote to cancer.  When you tell people you have got breast cancer they are always amazed, shocked. That makes it even harder, you feel a bit of a freak.  People said to me: 'It's not as bad as a woman getting it'. I thought 'Well, it is. It's still cancer.' I still had to have the operations, I still had to have treatment. When they say 'a woman feels less of a woman' when she has a mastectomy, well I felt less of a man.  After I had a mastectomy, I felt terrible looking in the mirror. I always thought I didn't have a body image problem as a man, but I felt lopsided.  I knew people did not see I had a ""moob"" on one side and nothing on the other, but I still felt everybody was looking at me.   I was not offered the chance to go flat or reconstruction. I spoke to them about it, but it came across that they thought I was weird for wanting another mastectomy. I just wanted both sides to be the same. Six months later I tried to cut it off myself, I know that sounds extreme, but that is where I was. The rational side of me knew it was not a big deal, but the emotional side drove me to try and cut it off. One night, at about 02:00, I went down to the kitchen and started cutting it. It was Lorraine who came down and stopped me.  I was not sectioned but I was house-sectioned, which meant I had to stay at home for two weeks. If it had not been for the psychiatrists, I do not think I would have been able to have another mastectomy. In the end I got the double mastectomy.   There were two different departments, and it was a fight for the mental health side to get through to the breast side to make them aware ""he really needs this"". Lorraine and I did everything together, through both our cancer journeys. She was very supportive. We were always at each other's appointments.  In 2016 Lorraine went into hospital with severe back pain, and two days later they told us ""it's bone cancer from breast"". They put her straight back on the antihistamine drug and then she had chemotherapy. We had the best 18 months we could have possibly had. We talked about everything that you could possibly talk about, things that people don't talk about, but need to talk about. We have nine children between us and we had never got round to getting married, but in the hospice we had a blessing of the rings. That was our wedding - 15 days later she died.   The thing that gives me the greatest comfort is I managed to say to Lorraine ""you've lived your life for everyone else, this is your death please go when you want to go"". Then on the Sunday she said: ""Pete, can I go now?"" In some ways I think my breast cancer was pushed to the back of my mind.  I can deal with grief when I am expecting grief, it is the unexpected ones, the tidal wave that will suddenly come over me. The last time I had my annual check-up at the hospital it really hit me. It had been a big part of our lives so when I was in the hospital waiting, I started seeing Lorraine walking around. When I got to the breast nurses I was just a blubbering mess.  One of the nurses came over and said ""have you ever thought of having nipples?"". It was the first time I had been offered nipple tattoos. I went to the hospital and a breast nurse did it for me. It is done like a tattoo but it's different type of ink. It was something I had not really thought about, but it has made a huge difference.  Men show nipples more than women do. I was not able to swim for years and years without keeping my top on and I lost the enjoyment of swimming I used to have. Now when I swim, I feel a lot more confident.  Before, I do not think I had accepted I had breast cancer. I just did not want to tell anyone.  I had been really isolated, I had never seen a group for men with breast cancer, I had never met anyone like me. It was a very lonely world, I did not know where to reach out.  Five-and-a-half years after getting breast cancer, I finally met another man who had gone through what I had. I was listening to 5 Live and it was about women choosing to go flat or have reconstruction. I felt neither was offered to me and that made me want to ring up.  Later, 5 Live put me in touch with Giles, who had also had a mastectomy following breast cancer. To speak to another male sufferer, to speak to someone that understood, it helped so much.  It made me feel more normal.  I have accepted that I had breast cancer. I suffered from breast cancer, it is something men can get; it feels liberating to be able to say that. I want to raise awareness that it isn't a women-only disease, it does happen to men.   I think Lorraine would be proud of me for trying to get the message out there.  There might be someone who reads this, and that one person might feel like they can talk to someone. I know that would make Lorraine happy.

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46616004,"A baby on a small Pacific island has become the first person given a vaccine delivered by a commercial drone. Unicef arranged for the drone to be flown some 40km (25 miles) across rugged mountains in Vanuatu that otherwise take hours to cross. About 20% of children in Vanuatu don't receive important vaccinations because the supply is too difficult.  The UN children's organisation hopes that drone delivery will in future be of vital importance in remote areas.  ""Today's small flight by drone is a big leap for global health,"" Unicef executive director Henrietta Fore said.  ""With the world still struggling to immunize the hardest to reach children, drone technologies can be a game changer for bridging that last mile to reach every child."" While drones have been used before to deliver medicine, Unicef says this was the first time globally that a country had contracted a commercial drone company to get vaccines to remote areas.  Two companies, Australia's Swoop Aero and Germany's Wingcopter, were chosen to conduct trials last month of the project on Vanuatu. The first proper delivery was carried out by Swoop Aero's drone. It carried the vaccines in a styrofoam box with ice packs and a temperature logger to a remote village on the island of Erromango, from Dillon's Bay on the west of the island to Cook's Bay on the east.  The medicine was then used by local nurse Miriam Nampil to vaccinate 13 children and five pregnant women.  Without the drone, Cook's Bay is only accessible on foot or by boat - both those options take hours compared to the 25 minutes it took for the drone to reach the village. Medical supplies also have to be kept at a cold temperature.  ""It's extremely hard to carry ice boxes to keep the vaccines cool while walking across rivers, mountains, through the rain, across rocky ledges,"" Ms Nampil said.  ""As the journey is often long and difficult, I can only go there once a month to vaccinate children. But now, with these drones, we can hope to reach many more children in the remotest areas of the island.""",,,,

Musa Manzini was kept awake during the six-hour operation partly to preserve and restore his finger movements. That decision was made ""taking into consideration my career as a musician"", the multi-instrumentalist and university lecturer said. The procedure took place at the Chief Albert Luthuli hospital in the coastal city of Durban. A video of Manzini's procedure shows him gently plucking the instrument on top of the operating table as medical staff tend to him. The operation was performed last week by a team of specialist neurosurgeons led by Dr Basil Enicker and Dr Rohen Harrichandparsad. Manzini said the recurring tumour on his brain is linked to a neurological condition he has had since 2006. Dr Enicker told the IOL news site that in this instance an ""awake"" operation was preferable to the use of general anaesthetic. ""In this way, we can test regions of the brain before [the tumour is] removed. This allows for increased removal of the tumour, while minimising damage to the brain,"" he said. Doctors wanted to minimise the risk of paralysis or loss of functions in the brain's motor cortex, which controls voluntary movement.

Chief medical officer Prof Dame Sally Davies said her dream was to make fruit and vegetables cheaper for everyone from the proceeds. In her annual report, she also urged the government to ban added sugar in jars of baby food. The food industry said taxes would not change consumer behaviour. Dame Sally Davies' report details plans to create a more healthy nation by 2040, with the focus on improving the environment we live in to make it easier for people to be healthier. This means tackling the preventable causes of 50% of chronic diseases and 40% of cancers - namely, unhealthy diet, smoking, physical inactivity, drinking too much alcohol and air pollution, she said. Based on the success of the tax on sugary drinks introduced in April, Dame Sally wants the government to do more to force the food industry to cut sugar and salt in our everyday food. Dame Sally said ""industry had not delivered"" on voluntary targets set by Public Health England to make their products healthier and called for them to do more. ""Those sectors that damage health must pay for their harm or subsidise healthier choices,"" her report says. She hinted she would like to see a tax on chocolate and junk food, with the proceeds going to subsidise fruit and vegetables, which should be on offer in obvious places in shops.  But she recognised this was ""a dream"". The report recommends: And it urges the government and NHS England to set targets to reduce inequalities in childhood obesity and smoking in pregnancy, which predominately affect poorer communities. Dame Sally said obesity was an issue of inequality, with children and adults in the poorest communities more likely to have diseases related to their weight at an earlier age, and lasting for longer. She said she would be accused of being ""chief nanny"" of a nanny state but it was her job to shape the environment for children who could not make their own choices. ""We should not be adding empty calories to baby food,"" Dame Sally said. ""It sets the taste for sweeter food and results in children gaining unnecessary weight before going to primary school."" The report says a health index for the UK is needed to measure all the factors which affect our health and its outcomes in order to see if progress is being made. A spokesman from the Treasury said it would not shy away from further action, including tax changes, if the food industry ""fails to face up to the scale of the problem through voluntary reduction programmes"". Kate Halliwell, head of UK diet and health policy at the Food and Drink Federation, said some manufacturers had been reducing sugar and calorie content in shopping baskets for more than a decade. But she cautioned that changing recipes for food products could not happen overnight. ""Sugar plays a variety of roles beyond sweetness in food including colour, texture and consistency.  ""It is for these reasons that we have long said that the guidelines are ambitious and will not be met across all categories or in the timescale outlined."" And she said portion control and product reformulation, rather than taxes, were policies more likely to change consumer behaviour. ""Food and drink companies should focus efforts where they can have the maximum impact, instead of managing the impact of wrong-headed legislation."" Meanwhile, the government has announced ¬£3.13bn will be given to councils in England next year for public health initiatives, such as stop smoking services, weight management services and exercise support.

These supervised units are places where revellers who have over-indulged can be checked and allowed to sleep it off. They should help take the pressure off hospital and 999 services over the busy Christmas and new year period.  Some will open later for ""Booze Black Friday"", the last Friday before Christmas, when drink sales usually peak as many office parties are held.  Many will be operational on New Year's Eve. The areas that are getting funding for drunk tanks include Soho in central London, Exeter, Bristol, Oxford, Hereford, Norwich, Blackpool and Southampton. Most of these areas already provide drunk tanks in their city or town centres on Fridays and Saturdays and the funding will enable them to expand their services over the holiday season. Drunk people who need more urgent medical care will still be taken to hospital when necessary. About one in seven patients who go to an accident and emergency unit is very drunk and caring for them takes staff away from other patients.  This rises to as many as seven in every 10 patients on a Friday or Saturday night. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: ""NHS does not stand for 'National Hangover Service', which is why we want to help other organisations take care of those who just need somewhere safe to get checked over and perhaps sleep it off."" Bristol launched the UK's first drunk tank four years ago. Since then, services have been rolled out to other cities and towns across the UK, including Cardiff and Belfast, but not in Scotland. NHS England soon could roll out more of them. A study looking into how effective they are is due to come out in 2019. Drunk tanks are often funded by charities and run in partnership with the police, the ambulance service and local hospitals. The South Central Ambulance Service is again running its SOS Service in Oxford using a dedicated ""jumbulance"", or large ambulance. Last year, the team saw 63 patients. Of these, only 14 required further treatment and/or assessment at the John Radcliffe Hospital. Paramedic and team member Craig Heigold said: ""The SOS Project provides a valuable service at a time of peak demand for all local NHS and emergency services in Oxford city centre.  ""By doing so, we can reduce the demand on our colleagues at A&E, as well as ensure that more Oxfordshire SCAS staff and vehicles are free to respond to non-alcohol related illnesses and injuries elsewhere in the city and surrounding areas.  ""We can also provide a faster and more effective response to patients in the city centre who need us.""",,,,

The surgery involves repairing the spinal tissue of the baby while it is still in the womb. It can improve their ability to walk and reduce health problems that result from spina bifida. The procedure is among several treatments being made available on the NHS for the first time from April. More than 200 babies are born in the UK each year with spina bifida, where the spine and spinal cord do not develop properly during pregnancy, causing a gap in the spine.   It often results in problems that include paralysis of the legs, incontinence and sometimes learning difficulties. The condition is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility. Spinal surgery in the womb was carried out in the UK for the first time earlier this year on two unborn babies at University College Hospital in London. In the past, patients had to travel abroad for the procedure. It is not known what causes spina bifida but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk. Kate Steele, chief executive of charity Shine, said: ""Although open pre-natal surgery is not a cure for spina bifida, and is not suitable for every pregnancy, any medical advances which will potentially improve the health and social outcomes for a baby born with spina bifida is very good news, and Shine welcomes this progress."" Among the other treatments that will be routinely offered on the NHS is the drug everolimus for epileptic seizures caused by a genetic condition that results in benign tumours developing in the body and brain, known as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).  More than 300 people, mostly children, will benefit from this new treatment that reduces the number and severity of seizures.

""Every year Santa Claus and his team of elves and reindeer stay awake for days and nights so he can deliver presents to children all over the world for Christmas - but he could be putting his and their health at risk,"" they say. Duly noted.  But for the rest of us  - does the festive period disrupt our sleep, and should we be worried about it? Of course, we can't speak for everyone, but there are a few things that might make December one of the less restful months of the year.    In December there is a clear spike in alcohol sales in the UK.  If you are socialising and drinking more than normal, you could find that your quality of sleep is compromised.  It is not only late nights and fewer hours of sleep making you tired - after drinking, the hours of sleep you do get may be less refreshing. That is because alcohol changes the normal sleep cycle.  A drink before bed is sometimes associated with helping you nod off, because people who have been drinking can find themselves falling into a deep sleep more quickly. However, in the second half of the night, research suggests alcohol makes sleep shallower and increases wakefulness. Your heart rate will remain higher and it may mean less time is spent in ""rapid eye movement"" or REM sleep - the time when we dream. That stage of sleep is thought to have a role in repairing the body as well as consolidating memories and emotional processing.  So overall, you could wake up less refreshed on the same number of hours' sleep than you would have without alcohol in your system.  You might also find yourself less able to deal with emotional or stressful situations the next day. There is a genetic element to whether you tend towards being a night owl or a morning lark. It is called a chronotype and refers to what time someone tends to want to sleep and wake. If there is a big difference between this - think of it as your biological time - and your social time (the hours you actually have to sleep and wake to fit in with your work or social schedule), you can develop social jetlag.  Like jetlag when you travel, it can make you feel groggy and affect your health.  And this effect can be exacerbated during busy times when social demands mean you are getting fewer hours of sleep during the week and sleeping in more at the weekends to compensate. Late chronotypes or night owls are likely to have the biggest differences in sleep timing between their work and free days, and so will suffer most from the affects of social jetlag. Researchers think people who have later chronotypes are more likely to use stimulants and alcohol, and are more likely to smoke.  As well as increased social demands at this time of year, family commitments can mean nights spent not in your own bed, perhaps with too many people crammed under one roof.  At a time of year when many people are rushing to finish work projects before the holidays, anxiety can be heightened.  Many of us also have social commitments, family and financial pressures piled on top.   The link between anxiety disorders and problems sleeping is well documented.  This is not to say that feeling anxious from time to time is the same as having an anxiety disorder - but some of the short-term impacts on your body can be the same.  Struggling to sleep when anxious also can set up a bit of a vicious circle, since sleep-deprived people might find it harder to regulate their emotions.  Shorter days and fewer hours of sunlight can make us crave more sleep. But it is not always possible to accommodate more hours in our daily routines, which can lead to feeling more tired in the day.  For some people, mild seasonal depression makes them feel more lethargic and have less energy. In more extreme cases, seasonal affective disorder - thought to affect about one in 15 people in the UK - can have a serious impact on people's lives.  If worrying about not getting enough sleep is, well, keeping you up at night - you can be reassured that short-term sleep disruption won't hurt you - as long as you are not operating heavy machinery. If you are feeling sleep deprived and planning on driving a car, you should exercise caution, but it is not going to damage your health long term. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46597323,"Every year, there are always more baby boys than girls born in England and Wales. Fact. Why? Since records began in 1838, the cries of babies born every year have been predominately male.  In not one year, stretching back to the start of Queen Victoria's reign, have girls outnumbered boys at birth. In 2017, in England and Wales, for example, there were 348,071 live male births and 331,035 live female births - a difference of roughly 17,000. And that higher tally of males compared to females born each year is a pattern that has repeated itself for nearly 180 years. In fact, a ratio of roughly 105 male births for every 100 female ones is generally seen as natural and normal. It is fairly consistent around the world, although in some countries like China and India the gap is wider because male offspring are more desirable. More surprisingly, it is a ratio that has been known about since the 17th Century. But why this ratio exists is not yet completely understood - although there are several theories. The first theory is an evolutionary one which says that in order to have an equal number of males and female in adulthood, there have to be slightly more males born. That is because being a male is a dangerous thing. Males are more likely than females to die in childhood and at all stages of life - from accidents, taking risks, suicide and from health problems. ""At every age, in almost every time and place, a man is more likely to die than a woman,"" says Prof David Steinsaltz, associate professor of statistics at the University of Oxford. So more males than females at the start of life should mean equal numbers of men and women in adulthood, so the theory goes. In fact, adult women always end up slightly outnumbering adult men in the UK, according to Office for National Statistics figures - and living longer. There are lots of different factors that could determine whether a male sperm (carrying a Y chromosome) or a female sperm (carrying an X chromosome) is first in the race to fertilise the woman's egg. These include the ages of the parents, the woman's ovulation cycle, levels of stress, diet and sexual position. One popular theory is that the odds of having a girl increase by having sex several days before ovulation and then abstaining so that the female sperm, which live longer, but swim more slowly than male sperm, outlast their counterparts. Conversely, if sex happens closer to ovulation or after it, the best swimmers get to the egg first and boys are produced. Parents may swear by these techniques, but scientists say there is little evidence they make any difference.  There is also some research which suggests parental stress could lead to the birth of more girls, while living through wars and conflicts may give rise to more male conceptions. If planning that sexual encounter does not have an impact on a baby's sex, then could something else be happening during pregnancy? If there are equal numbers of female and male-producing sperm and roughly equal numbers of conceptions, then more female foetuses must perish to give males the upper hand. Some research suggests females are more likely to be lost in the womb during early pregnancy, but other studies have shown males foetuses are more fragile later in pregnancy and lead to more stillbirths. Scientists say it is hard to pin down what actually happens and the reasons why. What we do know is that more male conceptions reach term and more boys are born.",,,,
1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46632332,"When actor Stephen McGann recently tweeted about his frustration with people who pressurised others to drink alcohol, he received an outpouring of support on social media.  ""Many people talked to me about the agonies they go through during Christmas. If you don't drink, for health or addiction reasons, then imagine how hard it is to be pressured into drinking,"" says the Call the Midwife actor.  McGann, who is 55, gave up alcohol 18 years ago after training for a charity trek. ""I grew up in the North in that beer culture, where you would sit in the pub and get a bladder-full. Now I don't get hangovers and I enjoy being the designated driver.   ""One friend really got wound up by me not drinking. Am not sure he's ever got over it. Now I get bloody-minded and indignant if people try to push a drink on me. Booze is so deeply ingrained in our culture. Recently I was at a do where a waiter put a glass of wine in my hand before I'd even said hello. Imagine if I was a recovering alcoholic? People would never try to get a vegetarian to eat meat."" Author Matt Haig, 43, who has written about his struggles with depression in his bestselling book, Reasons to Stay Alive, describes himself as a part-time teetotaller. ""I love drinking, but if I drink too much then it can trigger anxiety and then depression, so I have massive patches of not drinking. Sometimes it's just easier not to go  out, as I get too tempted.  ""Even if others don't pressurise me, you feel a silent pressure. It's a bit like being a vegan, it gets other people's backs up because they feel guilty or judged.""  Haig notes British society's obsession with drinking. ""As soon as we get that off switch we drink. Go to Gatwick and you'll see people drinking at 08:00. It's changing, young people are drinking less, but I'll never be that Mediterranean person who can have one glass of wine."" His tips for being a non-drinker include ordering a virgin Bloody Mary, ""it feels hedonistic"", going to a restaurant rather than a bar or pub, doing exercise to replace that space where you ""let off steam"", and saying to those who try to foist drinks on you: ""I don't drink."" ""People think there must be a reason and don't question it. It's about not feeling guilty, and not doing things out of obligation. The trouble with being a man is that we literally can't think of anywhere to meet that isn't a pub."" Catherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober Journal, recalls how when she used to drink she was one of the ""meanest drink pushers"". ""If somebody wasn't drinking I didn't want them there. But it was to do with my issues rather than them. It's the heaviest drinkers who call you no fun. They want an accomplice."" Gray, 38, gave up alcohol five years ago. ""I couldn't moderate. But then I hardly know anyone who can moderate, it's hard."" Now when people try to encourage her to drink she makes a joke of it. ""Nobody wants to hear you go on about the health risks. I tell them I'm a loose cannon. I make a joke out of it. Never be apologetic, people will leap on that."" Yet despite the fact that alcohol is deeply embedded in our social lives, the culture is changing. Recent figures from a study by the University of London showed that almost a third of young people don't drink at all.  Even so, young people, particularly those with mental health issues, still struggle with alcohol.  Jennifer Griffin, psychotherapist and general manager of Turn2me - an online charitable mental health website for young people, says many of those they help find social occasions that revolve around drinking difficult.  ""Alcohol is linked to anxiety and depression. Yet socialising is how young people develop a connection to their peers. If they choose not to socialise because they will be exposed to alcohol, then they might alienate themselves and suffer from loneliness.  ""The [buying a] round system is also an issue, it's lovely and generous, but it's difficult to resist."" Griffin suggests working out a strategy in advance, and prioritising your own needs.  As awareness of the health risks grow, not drinking, or cutting back on drinking, is becoming increasingly common. Everyone is in agreement. If someone says no to a drink, don't ask twice.

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46618192,"If you are contemplating a new year's health kick, you could be forgiven for feeling a little overwhelmed. Do yoga, run, lift weights, cut the carbs, or the fat (depending on the particular diet that's in vogue), ditch the booze, reduce your stress.  It is easy to feel like your life needs to be overhauled in order to be a healthy, happy human being.  But what if you were to make only one change? We asked experts what single thing they would recommend people should do to improve their health, assuming they are an adult who is otherwise healthy and not a smoker. It is easy to only think about our physical health.  But according to Dr Nadine Sammy, associate lecturer for sport and exercise sciences at the University of Exeter, we should also be focusing on improving our minds by building self-awareness.  You might think of this as something that prevents us from embarrassing ourselves, but, according to Dr Sammy, it is much more than this.  Self-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your moods, emotions and drives, and building it can play a crucial role in improving mental and physical wellbeing over time.  ""By understanding your feelings, motivations and behaviours in more depth, you can begin to act more consciously in order to make better choices for yourself,"" she says.  ""For instance, what is your motivation to exercise? When are you most - and when are you least - likely to stick to your exercise routine and why?""  There are many ways to do this, she says, including journaling, meditating, practicing mindfulness or simply making time for self-reflection after certain activities or at the end of the day.  ""Better understanding ourselves allows us to play to our strengths and build on our weaknesses, thereby spurring us on to be our best self,"" she adds. A gym membership, a pilates class, or a morning run - just some of the things that might come to mind when we think of becoming physically more active.  But though going to the gym works for some of us, many will quit after a month or two, says Dr Rhys Thatcher, a reader in exercise physiology at Aberystwyth University. Instead, he recommends finding ways to routinely incorporate exercise into our daily lives. There are plenty of ways to do this, from avoiding the lifts at work to parking on the far side of a supermarket car park when you are doing the shopping. But there are particular benefits to adopting a dog, he says. If you make sure to walk it for at least 30 minutes twice a day, you will be boosting your activity while also getting the emotional benefits of dog adoption. ""This way you get to spend time outside, you get to exercise, you get a loyal companion and at the same time you get to improve the life of another living thing, all of which have been shown to improve physical and mental health,"" says Dr Thatcher.   We have all heard about getting our five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. But according to Dr Megan Rossi, a research fellow at King's College London's department of nutritional sciences, it is not only quantity we should be striving for, but also diversity. We should aim for at least 30 different plant-based foods per week, she says.   That is because plant-based diversity is thought to have a key role in good gut health. The bacteria in our gut - collectively known as the microbiome - have a profound role in our health.  Allergies, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's, and even depression have all been linked to the bacteria in our gut. One way we can get more plant-based diversity in our diets easily is by being a little savvier about some of the foods we purchase, says Dr Rossi. ""Instead of just buying chickpeas go for the four-bean mix. Instead of buying one type of seed buy the four-seed mix,"" she says.  After the excesses of the holiday season, many of us will be planning to lose a couple of stone or setting a target for how many times we go to the gym each week. But the problem with ""arbitrary"" goals like these is that they are often difficult to achieve and failing to reach them can be demoralising, says Dr James Gill. Instead, he recommends focusing first on trying to be happier. ""There are lists of specific things that you can do to actively make your life healthier, but if you are not enjoying your life you probably won't stick to any difficult or challenging changes for the coming year,"" says Dr Gill, a locum GP and researcher at Warwick Medical School. But how do you go about becoming happier? Dr Gill recommends making one change in your life that will make you smile more often. At the same time, identify one thing that makes you unhappy and try to do something to improve it. ""Get those two in the bag, and you'll be ready to look to other things to really give your health a boost further into the year."" It may seem obvious, but we should all aim to get enough sleep (seven to nine hours a night for most healthy adults). Even being mildly deprived of it (five hours a night) can affect a range of cognitive functions, including decision making, says Dr Gavin Buckingham, senior lecturer in sport and health sciences at the University of Exeter. There are lots of things we can do to get a better night's sleep, from avoiding caffeine too close to bed to having a consistent bedtime.  But Dr Buckingham's top tip is to stop using electronic devices like phones and laptops well before bedtime or at least put on a filter that blocks the blue light in them.

1812,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-46700787,"A couple who underwent IVF treatment paid for by friends from a Facebook group have had a baby girl. Marisha Chaplin, 26, and Jon Hibbs, 29, who met while undergoing cancer treatment, had already had a daughter through IVF but could not afford a second round. A band of social media mums secretly raised ¬£2,000 for the couple - despite never having met them. Ms Chaplin gave birth to Isla on Saturday via Caesarean section. The new mother-of-two, from Cotgrave, Nottinghamshire, said she broke the news to members of the Facebook group as soon as she could. ""I messaged them on the Saturday morning when I was still pretty much out of it from all the drugs I had from the operation,"" she said. ""It's amazing, it really is. It's better than we ever imagined and we didn't think we would ever get to this point."" She added that Evie, now two and a half, was ""absolutely in love with her little sister"", and the couple were ""so grateful"" to those who had donated. The couple met as teenagers in 2007 when Ms Chaplin was having treatment and her future partner Mr Hibbs came in for a check-up. ""I saw him and said to our Clic Sargent worker 'I fancy him' basically, and she said she could give him my MSN address,"" said Ms Chaplin. She knew she would have fertility problems due to her cancer treatment so they started trying for a baby when she was 16. ""I was told by the time I was 23 my ovaries would give up,"" she said. ""At 16 my gynaecologist said 'You need to try for children sooner rather than later if you want them'."" They started IVF using donor eggs when Ms Chaplin was 23 and had Evie in May 2016. She then joined the Facebook group, called May Babies 2016, which was for other mothers who had given birth at the same time. After raising ¬£2,000 last July, members created a video to surprise the couple and played it to them via Facebook Live. In the emotional clip, Ms Chaplin starts to cry even before being told they had raised the money. The couple used frozen embryos left over from their previous IVF treatment, meaning Evie and Isla are full genetic sisters. ""We didn't ever think we had the chance to have another little one and the fact she's here is so surreal,"" said Ms Chaplin. ""Even when she came out we were like 'Is that our baby? Is this real?'""
